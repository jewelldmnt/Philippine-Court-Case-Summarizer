      "The City Prosecutor of Manila charged the accused Luis Pajarin and Efren Pallaya before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila in Criminal Cases 05-237756 and 05-237757 with violation of Section 5 in relation to Sections 26 and 11 (3) in relation to Section 13, respectively, of Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecution presented PO2 Nestor Lehetemas, member of the buy-bust team and PO2 James Nolan Ibañez, the poseur-buyer. They testified that on June 1, 2005 at around 10:00 p.m., an informant arrived at their Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) with the report that drugs would be sold on P. Ocampo and Dominga Streets the next day at around 5:00 pm. As the poseur-buyer, PO2 Ibañez marked a P500.00 bill with SAID on top of its serial number.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 2, 2005 the buy-bust team went to the site of the operation on board a Tamaraw FX which they parked near Dominga Street. The informant pointed to the two accused, Luis Pajarin and Efren Pallaya. They stood 10 to 20 steps away beside a red scooter. PO2 Ibañez and the informant approached them. After the informant introduced PO2 Ibañez as an interested buyer, the police officer bought shabu from the two, using the marked P500.00 bill. Pajarin opened the compartment of the red scooter and took from it one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance. When Pallaya asked for the money, PO2 Ibañez handed it to him. Then Pajarin gave one plastic sachet containing the suspected shabu to the officer, who raised his right hand as a pre-arranged signal. PO2 Ibañez’s companions immediately rushed to the group. PO2 Ibañez grabbed Pallaya. Pajarin tried to escape but PO2 Lehetemas got hold of him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The police searched the red scooter’s compartment and recovered another plastic sachet containing the same substance. They then brought the accused to their station. The arresting officers turned over the seized suspected shabu to PO3 Roel Young who marked the plastic sachet seized from the scooter with the letters “ETP,” and the sachet Pajarin handed over with the letters “LDCP.” Chemistry Report D-369-05 showed that upon examination of the submitted specimen, the same yielded positive result for Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "The defense had a completely different version. Pajarin said that at around 2:00 p.m. of June 2, 2005 he was at Pallaya’s house, repairing the latter’s motor pump. As he left the house and got into the street, someone hit his helmet, grabbed him, and dragged him into a Tamaraw FX. They then brought him back to Pallaya’s house where four police officers got in and brought Pallaya out with them after about three minutes. The officers brought the two accused to the police station where they were investigated. PO2 Ibañez showed Pajarin a plastic sachet which he supposedly recovered from Pajarin’s scooter. Pajarin denied owning the sachet. It was a police officer who drove the scooter to the police station. For his part, Pallaya testified that on June 2, 2005 he was taking a bath at the fourth floor of his four-storey house when he heard knocking at the door. When he opened it, he was surprised to see four men there, claiming to be police officers. They broke open the doors of the house from the ground to the third floor. The officers ordered him to dress up and forced him to go with them. Pallaya asked for a warrant of arrest or a search warrant but he got no response from them. They made him board a Tamaraw FX where Pajarin sat. They then brought the accused to the police station.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 31, 2008 the RTC found both accused guilty of the crime charged and imposed on them the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 in Criminal Case 05-237756. In Criminal Case 05-237757, the RTC sentenced Pajarin to suffer 12 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months of imprisonment and to pay a fine of P300,000.00. The RTC absolved Pallaya of this second offense.\n",

      "On appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC 03291, the latter rendered a decision dated September 30, 2009, affirming the RTC decision, hence the present appeal to this Court.\n",
      "\n",
      " [SEP] The Issues Presented\n",
      "Accused Pajarin and Pallaya raise two issues:\n",
      "1. Whether or not the CA erred in not excluding the evidence of the seized shabu on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove their integrity by establishing the chain of custody of the same until they got to the trial court; and\n",
      "2. Whether or not for this reason the CA erred in affirming their conviction. [SEP] This case is about the need for the prosecution and all law enforcement agencies involved in illegal drugs operations to ensure proper observance of the rules governing entrapment of peddlers of prohibited substances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rulings of the Court\n",
      "Appellants chiefly argue that the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation failed to comply with Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9165, which requires them to take immediate inventory of and photograph the seized item in the presence of the accused or his representative or responsible third persons mentioned but always taking care that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized articles are preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court has held in numerous cases that the failure of the police to comply with the procedure laid down in R.A. 9165 would not render void the seizure of the prohibited substance for as long as the apprehending officers give justifiable reason for their imperfect conduct and show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated items had not been compromised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the prosecution failed to show that the substances allegedly seized from the accused were the same substances presented in court to prove their guilt. Usually, the seized article changes hands from the police officer who takes it from the accused, to the supervising officer at their station, to the messenger who brings them to the police crime laboratory, and then to the court where it is adduced as evidence. Since custody and possession change over time, it has been held indispensable that the officer who seized the article places it in a plastic container unless it is already in one, seals it if yet unsealed, and puts his marking on the cover. In this way there is assurance, upon inspection, that the substance reaches the laboratory in the same condition it was seized from the accused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the police officers did not mark the sealed plastic sachets to show that they were the same things they took from the accused. Rather, the marking on the items were done by the station investigator who would have no way of knowing that the substances were really seized from the accused. The marking of captured items immediately after they are seized from the accused is the starting point in the custodial link. This step is vital because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. Failure to place such markings paves the way for swapping, planting, and contamination of the evidence. These lapses seriously cast doubt on the authenticity of the corpus delicti, warranting acquittal on reasonable doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "nt; and that he placed his own marking on the same to ensure that it could not be tampered pending trial. In case the parties stipulate to dispense with the attendance of the police chemist, they should stipulate that the latter would have testified that he took the precautionary steps mentioned. Here, the record fails to show this.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a serious concern that quite often the failure of the police to observe the rules governing buy-bust operations results in acquittals. Drug enforcement agencies should continually train their officers and agents to observe these rules and transfer out those who would not. The prosecutors conducting preliminary investigation should not file in court drugs cases where the sworn statements of the police officers, the report of the chemical analyst, and the object evidence do not show compliance with the same. And trial courts should order the case dismissed and the accused released from detention if on examination the supporting documents are wanting in this respect. They should not waste their precious time to useless exercise where the police and the prosecution fail to observe the rule of law especially in so serious offenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the Court REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the decision of the Court of Appeals dated September 30, 2009 in CA-G.R. CR-HC 03291 as well as the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 2, in Criminal Cases 05-237756 and 05-237757, and ACQUITS the accused-appellants Luis Pajarin and Efren Pallaya on the ground of reasonable doubt.

Candelario (Arthur) against respondent Marlene E. Candelario (Marlene).\n",
      "The Facts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur and Marlene were married in a civil ceremony on June 11, 1984. Their marriage produced one child who was born on May 14, 1985. Hoping to provide a better life for her family, Marlene moved to Singapore to work as a domestic helper sometime in October 1987 and left her child under the care and custody of Arthur, who worked as a farmer. While working in Singapore, Marlene sent her earnings to her family. However, Arthur took advantage of Marlene’s absence and frequently visited nightclubs where he later on met his present partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marlene heard about Arthur’s affair and decided to return to the Philippines in October 1989 without the latter’s knowledge. It was then when she discovered that Arthur and his new partner were already living together in their conjugal dwelling. Because of this, Marlene separated from Arthur that same year. Meanwhile, Marlene took their child from the custody of Arthur and was eventually raised and cared for by Marlene’s sister and parents. For his part, Arthur continued to live with his partner and they had four children together.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 20 years later, Arthur filed before the RTC a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, praying that his marriage with Marlene be declared void ab initio due to his psychological incapacity to comply with his essential marital obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marlene was served with summons but failed to file a written answer. Consequently, the RTC ordered the provincial prosecutor to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether collusion existed between the parties. The investigation report negated the presence of collusion between Arthur and Marlene. At the scheduled pre-trial conference, Marlene was likewise absent, and subsequently, the RTC declared the pre-trial terminated and set the case for trial on the merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "During trial, Arthur testified on his own behalf. Additionally, Dr. Daisy L. Chua-Daquilanea (Dr. Chua-Daquilanea), a psychiatry practitioner for 20 years, also testified for Arthur by way of Judicial Affidavit, which she identified together with her Psychiatric Report.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea, she conducted a psychiatric evaluation of Arthur and Marlene based on a series of psychiatric interviews, mental status examinations, neurologic and physical examinations of the parties themselves and collateral data from the following persons: (a) Faustina Mendoza (Faustina), the owner of the land where Arthur worked; (b) Cerina Bardina (Cerina), a neighbor of the couple; and (c) Rizalyn Basilio (Rizalyn), the sister of Marlene. Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment revealed that Arthur was afflicted with Dependent Personality Disorder. The Psychiatric Report stated that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the foregoing psychiatric evaluation, the petitioner is found to have a DEPENDENT PERSONALITY DISORDER. He was found to have an extreme pattern of dependency. This was due to low self-esteem and fear of abandonment from an overprotective parental figure. This psychological conflict affected his development such that this personality disorder was noted prior to the marriage and became more prominent during the marriage. It is found to be serious as he manifested with the full-blown signs and symptoms of this extreme dependency. It was the cause of his untoward behavior in marital life and made him incapable to do his marital obligations to love, care, respect, render support and fidelity to his spouse. It was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The respondent is not found to have any disorder as she was able to cope with the marital crisis and showed no deterioration in her functioning. She was rational in her decisions to improve the future of her child and of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the petition for nullity of marriage in this case is highly recommended based on the presence of a severe and irreversible personality disorder on the part of the petitioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his evidence were admitted by the trial court, Arthur rested his case. Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for resolution given that Marlene and the State opted not to present any evidence.\n",
      " [SEP] Issue\n",
      "The sole issue presented before this Court is whether the Family Code, particularly Art. 36 thereof, can be retroactively applied to marriages that took place before its effectivity on August 3, 1988, including that of Arthur and Marlene’s marriage, which was solemnized on June 11, 1984.\n",
      " [SEP] Ruling of the Regional Trial Court\n",
      "\n",
      "In its March 6, 2015 Judgment, the RTC denied Arthur’s Petition for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the verified PETITION dated January 18, 2013 of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario is hereby DENIED for lack of merit and, to all intents and purposes, this case is hereby dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let separate copies of this judgment be furnished to Atty. Jenalyn A. Traifalgar, Prosecutor Marilou Garachico-Fabila, the Office of the Solicitor General, the respondent Marlene E. Candelario and the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RTC gave credence to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s psychiatric evaluation and found that Arthur’s psychological incapacity, which was characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, had been preponderantly established. However, even if this were the case, the trial court ruled that his marriage to Marlene cannot be nullified or declared as void ab initio under Article 36 of the Family Code considering that the said Code only became effective on August 3, 1988, while Arthur and Marlene’s marriage was celebrated on June 11, 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aggrieved, Arthur moved for reconsideration; however, the same was denied through the trial court’s December 7, 2015 Order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Present Petition\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the above, Arthur filed before this Court the present Petition for Review on Certiorari, raising the lone assignment of error, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "The [c]ourt a [quo] erred in finding that the Family Code of the Philippines, particularly Section [sic] Thirty-Six (36) thereof, providing Psychological Incapacity as a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage, has no retroactive effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a February 10, 2016 Resolution, the Court resolved to implead the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in the instant case. In compliance thereto, A11hur filed a Motion to Amend Petition and to Admit Amended Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter, in a March 14, 2016 Resolution, the Court denied the Petition for “failure to sufficiently show that the trial court committed any reversible error in the challenged judgment and order as to warrant the exercise by this Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.” It also stated that the Petition failed to comply with certain requirements under Rule 45 and other related provisions of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, Arthur filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated March 14, 2016. Acting on such motion, the Court, in a July 25, 2016 Resolution, required the respondents to file their respective comments thereon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its Comment dated October 20, 2017, the OSG disagreed with the RTC’s disquisition and opined that the latter erred in ruling that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be declared void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity on the part of petitioner, on the sole reason that their marriage was celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, after copies of the Resolutions were returned unserved, the Court issued a Resolution on June 27, 2018 dispensing with the filing of Marlene’s Comment on Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, on March 20, 2019, the Court granted Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration and set aside its March 14, 2016 Resolution. It then required the parties to file their Comment to the Petition, to which the OSG filed its Manifestation In Lieu of Comment, stating that it is adopting its Comment dated October 20, 2017 as its Comment to the Petition for Review on Certiorari. On the other hand, Marlene still failed to file her Comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the Court will now proceed to determine the merits of the Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Ruling\n",
      "\n",
      "We deny the petition.\n",
      "At the outset, it must be borne in mind that direct recourse to this Court from the decisions and final orders of the RTC may be taken where only questions of law are raised or involved. There is a question of law when the doubt arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, which does not call for the examination of the probative value of the evidence of the parties. Here, the question on the retroactive application of the Family Code does not entail a review or evaluation of the evidence presented by Arthur at the trial court level. Verily, petitioner raised a pure question of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recall, while the RTC found that Arthur’s Dependent Personality Disorder rendered him psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations, it nevertheless held that his marriage to Marlene, which was celebrated on June 11, 1984, cannot be dissolved on the ground of psychological incapacity because the Family Code did not yet exist during that time. It held that the applicable law that was in effect during the celebration of their marriage was the Civil Code, which did not contain any provision similar to Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court disagrees with the conclusion reached by the RTC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal provisions that are pertinent to the case are Arts. 36, 39, and 256 of the Family Code, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 39. The action or defense for the declaration of absolute nullity of a marriage shall not prescribe. (As amended by Executive Order 227 and Republic Act No. 8533; The phrase “However, in case of marriage celebrated before the effectivity of this Code and falling under Article 36, such action or defense shall prescribe in ten years after this Code shall have taken effect” has been deleted by Republic Act No. 8533 [Approved February 23, 1998]).\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 256. This Code shall have retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights in accordance with the Civil Code or other laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "A plain reading of the above provisions would reveal that the Family Code, including its concept of psychological incapacity as a ground to nullify marriage, shall be given retroactive effect, to the extent that no vested or acquired rights under relevant laws will be prejudiced or impaired. The amendment of Art. 39 would also show that an action for nullifying a marriage is imprescriptible, without any distinction as to whether the marriage was solemnized before or after the effectivity of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise stated, nowhere does it state that Art. 36 cannot be retroactively applied to marriages that were celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code. Basic is the rule in statutory construction that where the law does not distinguish, the courts should not distinguish. Where the law is free from ambiguity, the court may not introduce exceptions or conditions where none is provided from considerations of convenience, public welfare, or for any laudable purpose; neither may it engraft into the law qualifications not contemplated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, it is worthy to point out that in Santos v. Court of Appeals, this Court took the opportunity to discuss the import of psychological incapacity during the deliberations of the Family Code Revision Committee, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Puno formulated the next Article as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Art.] 37. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated, to comply with the essential obligations of marriage shall likewise be void from the beginning even if such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Caguioa suggested that “even if” be substituted with “although.” On the other hand, Prof. Bautista proposed that the clause “although such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization” be deleted since it may encourage one to create the manifestation of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa pointed out that, as in other provisions, they cannot argue on the basis of abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Diy suggested that they also include mental and physical incapacities, which are lesser in degree than psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa explained that mental and physical incapacities are vices of consent while psychological incapacity is not a species of vice of consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean Gupit read what Bishop Cruz said on the matter in the minutes of their February 9, 1984 meeting:\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the third ground, Bishop Cruz indicated that the phrase ‘psychological or mental impotence” is an invention of some churchmen who are moralists but not canonists, that is why it is considered a weak phrase. He said that the Code of Canon Law would rather express it as ‘psychological or mental incapacity to discharge…”\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Caguioa remarked that they deleted the word ‘mental’ precisely to distinguish it from vice of consent. He explained that ‘psychological incapacity’ refers to lack of understanding of the essential obligations of marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Puno reminded the members that, at the last meeting, they have decided not to go into the classification of “psychological incapacity” because there was a lot of debate on it and that this is precisely the reason why they classified it as a special case.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, Justice Puno remarked that, since there having been annulments of marriages arising from psychological incapacity, Civil Law should not reconcile with Canon Law because it is a new ground even under Canon Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prof. Romero raised the question: With this common provision in Civil Law and in Canon Law, are they going to have a provision in the Family Code to the effect that marriages annulled or declared void by the church on the ground of psychological incapacity is automatically annulled in Civil Law? The other members replied negatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Puno and Prof. Romero inquired if Article 37 should be retroactive or prospective in application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Diy opined that she was for its retroactivity because it is their answer to the problem of church annulments of marriages, which are still valid under the Civil Law. On the other hand, Justice Reyes and Justice Puno were concerned about the avalanche of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean Gupit suggested that they put the issue to a vote, which the Committee approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The members voted as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Justice Reyes, Justice Puno and Prof. Romero were for prospectivity.\n",
      "(2) Justice Caguioa, Judge Diy, Dean Gupit, Prof. Bautista and Director Eufemio were for retroactivity.\n",
      "(3) Prof. Baviera abstained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Caguioa suggested that they put in the prescriptive period of ten years within which the action for declaration of nullity of the marriage should be filed in court. The Committee approved the suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foregoing, it can be gleaned that the Family Code Revision Committee actually took into consideration and voted on the retroactive application of Art. 36. In this regard, even if Arthur and Marlene’s marriage took place before the effectivity of the Family Code, the same can be declared void on the ground of Arthur’s psychological incapacity, as long as no vested or acquired rights are disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this score, it must be noted that the records are bereft of any indication that there were vested or acquired rights that were prejudiced or impaired in this case. As mentioned by Arthur in his Petition, “[d]uring their marriage, the spouses have not acquired real and personal properties of significant value.” It bears emphasis that if Marlene had an actual vested or acquired right that would be prejudiced should the Family Code be given retroactive effect, she should have raised such matter at the first possible instance or at any given stage of the proceedings where she was required to file an answer or comment. However, this she did not do. For failure to avail herself of the several opportunities given to her, she is deemed to have waived her right to prove and testify on such matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the petitioner also correctly pointed out that there have already been numerous cases promulgated by this Court where Art. 36 of the Family Code was applied even though the marriage involved was celebrated prior to August 3, 1988. As painstakingly enumerated by Arthur in his Motion for Reconsideration before the RTC:\n",
      "\n",
      "22. In Chi Ming Tsoi vs. CA and Gina Lao-Tsoi,\n",
      "\n",
      "23. In Republic vs. CA and Roridel Olaviano Molina,\n",
      "\n",
      "24. The marriage of Reynaldo Molina to Roridel Olaviano Molina may have been ruled subsisting and valid, but the Supreme Court did not find any issue with regard to the application of Article 36 of the Family Code in the said case, notwithstanding the fact that Reynaldo and Roridel were married on April 14, 1985, a date that falls BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988;\n",
      "\n",
      "25. It is not lost on PETITIONER that even the case of Marcos vs. Marcos cited by this Honorable Court in the assailed JUDGMENT involves a case in which the parties were married BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code, that is, the date of the marriage is September 6, 1982;\n",
      "\n",
      "26. In fact, there is a plethora of cases that reached the Supreme Court, which cases raised the issue of PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY of either or both parties, concerning marriages solemnized BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988, among which are the following:\n",

      "Further, the OSG also properly observed in its Comment that, “the ruling of the court a quo discriminates against married couples for no reason other than having had the misfortune of contracting their marriage earlier than 3 August 1998. There is no reason why it should be so, as all persons are prone to being afflicted by a psychological disorder that could cause a downright incapacity to perform the obligations of marriage. The question should not be when the party asking for dissolution got married, but whether such psychological incapacity in fact exists.”\n",
      "From the foregoing, the Court sees no reason why it should depart from its earlier rulings which recognized the applicability of Art. 36 even to those marriages celebrated prior the effectivity of the Family Code. Given this, the Court agrees with both petitioner and the OSG that the RTC erred when it held that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be nullified on the ground of psychological incapacity solely on the basis that the Family Code was not yet in effect then.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture, it must be recalled that the RTC actually found Arthur to be psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. It held that:\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the result of the psychiatric evaluation of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario by Dr. Daisy L. Chua Daquilanea preponderantly establishes that the petitioner is afflicted with a dependent personality disorder, a psychological incapacity characterized by severity or gravity, juridical antecedence and incurability, which has made the petitioner incognitive of the essential marital obligations of marriage that require the spouses to live together, observe mutual love, respect and fidelity, and render mutual help and support (Art. 68, Family Code; Republic vs. Iyoy, 470 SCRA 508). It is then obvious that before and at the time the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario and the respondent Marlene E. Candelario contracted marriage on June 11, 1984, the said petitioner was already psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, and the same still subsists as it is incurable such that their marriage would be void under Article 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the jurisprudential development established in Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan-Andal) leads this Court to re-examine the findings of the trial court.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Tan-Andal, the Court abandoned previous jurisprudence on psychological incapacity and categorically upheld that it is “neither a mental incapacity nor a personal disorder that must be proven through expert opinion.” Nevertheless, the Court added that proof must still be provided to show the durable or enduring aspects of a person’s personality, called “personality structure,” which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse’s personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations embedded in the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Court in Tan-Andal stated that these aspects of personality need not be given by an expert. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. What is important is that the plaintiff-spouse must prove his or her case with clear and convincing evidence, with the totality of evidence sufficient to support a finding of psychological incapacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be that as it may, the alleged psychological incapacity must still be shown to be grave, incurable, and juridically antecedent. First, gravity still has to be established, if only to preclude spouses from invoking mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts as ground for nullity. Second, incurability should also be understood in the legal sense. So long as the couple’s respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable breakdown of the marriage, the psychological incapacity of a spouse or both spouses is deemed “incurable.” Third, juridical antecedence or the existence of the condition prior to the celebration of marriage, is a statutory requirement which must be proven by the spouse alleging psychological incapacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying the foregoing in the instant case, the Court finds that no psychological incapacity exists on record to merit nullifying Arthur and Marlene’s marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Arthur presented the Psychiatric Report of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea who found that the former is suffering from Dependent Personality Disorder brought about by an overprotective upbringing which led him to have dependency, low self-esteem, and abandonment issues that affected his marriage with Marlene. To recall, such findings were based on the testimony of Arthur, Marlene, and three other informants who knew the couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this Court cannot accept such evidence as sufficient given that it failed to establish the gravity, incurability, and juridical antecedence of Arthur’s alleged incapacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reading of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s report reveals that her findings are lacking in data as to Arthur’s personality structure and how it incapacitates him to perform the essential marital obligations. Neither does it prove that Arthur’s psychological incapacity is due to a genuine psychic cause. While the report was detailed on how Arthur had a difficult upbringing, it failed to show that his condition made it practically impossible for him to comply with the ordinary duties required in marriage. It only offered a general assessment on the supposed effect of Arthur’s personality disorder to his marital union with Marlene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the Psychiatric Report stated that Arthur “had no regrets in this marriage and exerted no effort to save it” and that “during marriage, he carried with him the same attachment issues of his developmental years, imbibed as part of who he had become as a person.” It further added that:\n",
      "\n",
      "x x x In his marital life with her, he continued to grapple with self-doubts and low self-esteem, which were the core conflicts of an extremely dependent individual. When she left him to work abroad, he perceived this as loss or abandonment such that he could not cope with it because of his dependent personality disorder. He longed to have a constant dose of care and affection. Without her, he did not show consistent ability to assume responsibilities, like a simple work as a tricycle driver and farmer, to fend for his family and take care of their only daughter. He needed to always sustain attachment with another to prevent himself from feeling fearful of facing things on his own. Hence, he related with another woman. He brought this woman home and the respondent saw all these when she surprised him by an unannounced vacation. He failed to love, care, respect, render support and most of all, [show] fidelity to his spouse. She could not bear to remain connected with him who could not detach from other women and his vices. She did not want to continue the marital relationship with him and separated from him permanently. His dependent personality got in the way such that she opted to eventually separate from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, no other adequate explanation was provided to show that Arthur’s failure to assume his marital obligations was not because of his mere refusal, neglect, difficulty, or ill will. It is worthy to point out that Art. 36 of the Family Code contemplates downright incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations. It is not enough to prove that a spouse failed to meet his responsibilities and duties as a married person; the incapacity must be so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage. Here, it can be gleaned that Arthur simply made no real effort to work on his marriage with Marlene.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this, the Court finds that the requirement of gravity was not satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court also holds that the requirement of incurability was not sufficiently proven. Jurisprudence provides that in order for the said requisite to be met, there must be “an undeniable pattern of a persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse that must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.” Unfortunately, the Court finds that Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment of Arthur is wanting in this respect. While it was shown that Arthur had an extramarital affair while Marlene was working abroad, there was not enough evidence provided to prove that his incapacity or condition was incurable. Similar to the requirement on gravity, the report only made a general evaluation on the incurability of Arthur’s condition by stating that, “it was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the Court also finds that the requirement of juridical antecedence was not met. There was no sufficient evidence that Arthur’s alleged incapacity existed prior to his marriage to Marlene. While the Psychiatric Report cited the corroborative testimonies of Faustina, Cerina, and Rizalyn, the same do not indicate that they have known Arthur longer than such period of time as to have personal knowledge of his circumstances. It is not clear in the report that these persons had already been present in Arthur’s life before the latter contracted marriage to testify on his past experiences or environment while growing up that they have consistently observed which may have triggered his behavior towards Marlene.\n",
      "\n",
      "It bears emphasis that irreconcilable differences, conflicting personalities, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, physical abuse, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity or perversion, and abandonment, by themselves, do not warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 of the Family Code. It must be stressed that an unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, Arthur failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his personality disorder was one of psychological incapacity within the meaning of Art. 36 of the Family Code that would warrant the severance of Arthur and Marlene’s marital bonds. Failing in this regard, the Court must protect the sanctity of their marriage as mandated by the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The March 6, 2015 Judgment and the December 7, 2015 Order of the Regional Trial Court of San Jose, Antique, Branch 11, in Civil Case No. 2013-01-3848 are AFFIRMED. The marriage between Arthur A.

      "This Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeks to set aside the March 6, 2015 Judgment and the December 7, 2015 Order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Jose, Antique, Branch 11, in Civil Case No. 2013-01-3848, which denied the Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage filed by petitioner Arthur A. Candelario (Arthur) against respondent Marlene E. Candelario (Marlene).\n",
      "The Facts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Arthur and Marlene were married in a civil ceremony on June 11, 1984. Their marriage produced one child who was born on May 14, 1985. Hoping to provide a better life for her family, Marlene moved to Singapore to work as a domestic helper sometime in October 1987 and left her child under the care and custody of Arthur, who worked as a farmer. While working in Singapore, Marlene sent her earnings to her family. However, Arthur took advantage of Marlene’s absence and frequently visited nightclubs where he later on met his present partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marlene heard about Arthur’s affair and decided to return to the Philippines in October 1989 without the latter’s knowledge. It was then when she discovered that Arthur and his new partner were already living together in their conjugal dwelling. Because of this, Marlene separated from Arthur that same year. Meanwhile, Marlene took their child from the custody of Arthur and was eventually raised and cared for by Marlene’s sister and parents. For his part, Arthur continued to live with his partner and they had four children together.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 20 years later, Arthur filed before the RTC a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, praying that his marriage with Marlene be declared void ab initio due to his psychological incapacity to comply with his essential marital obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marlene was served with summons but failed to file a written answer. Consequently, the RTC ordered the provincial prosecutor to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether collusion existed between the parties. The investigation report negated the presence of collusion between Arthur and Marlene. At the scheduled pre-trial conference, Marlene was likewise absent, and subsequently, the RTC declared the pre-trial terminated and set the case for trial on the merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "During trial, Arthur testified on his own behalf. Additionally, Dr. Daisy L. Chua-Daquilanea (Dr. Chua-Daquilanea), a psychiatry practitioner for 20 years, also testified for Arthur by way of Judicial Affidavit, which she identified together with her Psychiatric Report.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea, she conducted a psychiatric evaluation of Arthur and Marlene based on a series of psychiatric interviews, mental status examinations, neurologic and physical examinations of the parties themselves and collateral data from the following persons: (a) Faustina Mendoza (Faustina), the owner of the land where Arthur worked; (b) Cerina Bardina (Cerina), a neighbor of the couple; and (c) Rizalyn Basilio (Rizalyn), the sister of Marlene. Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment revealed that Arthur was afflicted with Dependent Personality Disorder. The Psychiatric Report stated that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the foregoing psychiatric evaluation, the petitioner is found to have a DEPENDENT PERSONALITY DISORDER. He was found to have an extreme pattern of dependency. This was due to low self-esteem and fear of abandonment from an overprotective parental figure. This psychological conflict affected his development such that this personality disorder was noted prior to the marriage and became more prominent during the marriage. It is found to be serious as he manifested with the full-blown signs and symptoms of this extreme dependency. It was the cause of his untoward behavior in marital life and made him incapable to do his marital obligations to love, care, respect, render support and fidelity to his spouse. It was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The respondent is not found to have any disorder as she was able to cope with the marital crisis and showed no deterioration in her functioning. She was rational in her decisions to improve the future of her child and of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the petition for nullity of marriage in this case is highly recommended based on the presence of a severe and irreversible personality disorder on the part of the petitioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his evidence were admitted by the trial court, Arthur rested his case. Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for resolution given that Marlene and the State opted not to present any evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling of the Regional Trial Court\n",
      "\n",
      "In its March 6, 2015 Judgment, the RTC denied Arthur’s Petition for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the verified PETITION dated January 18, 2013 of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario is hereby DENIED for lack of merit and, to all intents and purposes, this case is hereby dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let separate copies of this judgment be furnished to Atty. Jenalyn A. Traifalgar, Prosecutor Marilou Garachico-Fabila, the Office of the Solicitor General, the respondent Marlene E. Candelario and the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RTC gave credence to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s psychiatric evaluation and found that Arthur’s psychological incapacity, which was characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, had been preponderantly established. However, even if this were the case, the trial court ruled that his marriage to Marlene cannot be nullified or declared as void ab initio under Article 36 of the Family Code considering that the said Code only became effective on August 3, 1988, while Arthur and Marlene’s marriage was celebrated on June 11, 1984.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aggrieved, Arthur moved for reconsideration; however, the same was denied through the trial court’s December 7, 2015 Order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Present Petition\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the above, Arthur filed before this Court the present Petition for Review on Certiorari, raising the lone assignment of error, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "The [c]ourt a [quo] erred in finding that the Family Code of the Philippines, particularly Section [sic] Thirty-Six (36) thereof, providing Psychological Incapacity as a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage, has no retroactive effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a February 10, 2016 Resolution, the Court resolved to implead the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in the instant case. In compliance thereto, A11hur filed a Motion to Amend Petition and to Admit Amended Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter, in a March 14, 2016 Resolution, the Court denied the Petition for “failure to sufficiently show that the trial court committed any reversible error in the challenged judgment and order as to warrant the exercise by this Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.” It also stated that the Petition failed to comply with certain requirements under Rule 45 and other related provisions of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, Arthur filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated March 14, 2016. Acting on such motion, the Court, in a July 25, 2016 Resolution, required the respondents to file their respective comments thereon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its Comment dated October 20, 2017, the OSG disagreed with the RTC’s disquisition and opined that the latter erred in ruling that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be declared void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity on the part of petitioner, on the sole reason that their marriage was celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, after copies of the Resolutions were returned unserved, the Court issued a Resolution on June 27, 2018 dispensing with the filing of Marlene’s Comment on Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, on March 20, 2019, the Court granted Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration and set aside its March 14, 2016 Resolution. It then required the parties to file their Comment to the Petition, to which the OSG filed its Manifestation In Lieu of Comment, stating that it is adopting its Comment dated October 20, 2017 as its Comment to the Petition for Review on Certiorari. On the other hand, Marlene still failed to file her Comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the Court will now proceed to determine the merits of the Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue\n",
      "\n",
      "The sole issue presented before this Court is whether the Family Code, particularly Art. 36 thereof, can be retroactively applied to marriages that took place before its effectivity on August 3, 1988, including that of Arthur and Marlene’s marriage, which was solemnized on June 11, 1984.\n",
      "Our Ruling\n",
      "\n",
      "We deny the petition.\n",
      "At the outset, it must be borne in mind that direct recourse to this Court from the decisions and final orders of the RTC may be taken where only questions of law are raised or involved. There is a question of law when the doubt arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, which does not call for the examination of the probative value of the evidence of the parties. Here, the question on the retroactive application of the Family Code does not entail a review or evaluation of the evidence presented by Arthur at the trial court level. Verily, petitioner raised a pure question of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recall, while the RTC found that Arthur’s Dependent Personality Disorder rendered him psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations, it nevertheless held that his marriage to Marlene, which was celebrated on June 11, 1984, cannot be dissolved on the ground of psychological incapacity because the Family Code did not yet exist during that time. It held that the applicable law that was in effect during the celebration of their marriage was the Civil Code, which did not contain any provision similar to Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court disagrees with the conclusion reached by the RTC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal provisions that are pertinent to the case are Arts. 36, 39, and 256 of the Family Code, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 39. The action or defense for the declaration of absolute nullity of a marriage shall not prescribe. (As amended by Executive Order 227 and Republic Act No. 8533; The phrase “However, in case of marriage celebrated before the effectivity of this Code and falling under Article 36, such action or defense shall prescribe in ten years after this Code shall have taken effect” has been deleted by Republic Act No. 8533 [Approved February 23, 1998]).\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 256. This Code shall have retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights in accordance with the Civil Code or other laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "A plain reading of the above provisions would reveal that the Family Code, including its concept of psychological incapacity as a ground to nullify marriage, shall be given retroactive effect, to the extent that no vested or acquired rights under relevant laws will be prejudiced or impaired. The amendment of Art. 39 would also show that an action for nullifying a marriage is imprescriptible, without any distinction as to whether the marriage was solemnized before or after the effectivity of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise stated, nowhere does it state that Art. 36 cannot be retroactively applied to marriages that were celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code. Basic is the rule in statutory construction that where the law does not distinguish, the courts should not distinguish. Where the law is free from ambiguity, the court may not introduce exceptions or conditions where none is provided from considerations of convenience, public welfare, or for any laudable purpose; neither may it engraft into the law qualifications not contemplated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, it is worthy to point out that in Santos v. Court of Appeals, this Court took the opportunity to discuss the import of psychological incapacity during the deliberations of the Family Code Revision Committee, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Puno formulated the next Article as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Art.] 37. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated, to comply with the essential obligations of marriage shall likewise be void from the beginning even if such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Caguioa suggested that “even if” be substituted with “although.” On the other hand, Prof. Bautista proposed that the clause “although such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization” be deleted since it may encourage one to create the manifestation of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa pointed out that, as in other provisions, they cannot argue on the basis of abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Diy suggested that they also include mental and physical incapacities, which are lesser in degree than psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa explained that mental and physical incapacities are vices of consent while psychological incapacity is not a species of vice of consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean Gupit read what Bishop Cruz said on the matter in the minutes of their February 9, 1984 meeting:\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the third ground, Bishop Cruz indicated that the phrase ‘psychological or mental impotence” is an invention of some churchmen who are moralists but not canonists, that is why it is considered a weak phrase. He said that the Code of Canon Law would rather express it as ‘psychological or mental incapacity to discharge…”\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Caguioa remarked that they deleted the word ‘mental’ precisely to distinguish it from vice of consent. He explained that ‘psychological incapacity’ refers to lack of understanding of the essential obligations of marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Puno reminded the members that, at the last meeting, they have decided not to go into the classification of “psychological incapacity” because there was a lot of debate on it and that this is precisely the reason why they classified it as a special case.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, Justice Puno remarked that, since there having been annulments of marriages arising from psychological incapacity, Civil Law should not reconcile with Canon Law because it is a new ground even under Canon Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prof. Romero raised the question: With this common provision in Civil Law and in Canon Law, are they going to have a provision in the Family Code to the effect that marriages annulled or declared void by the church on the ground of psychological incapacity is automatically annulled in Civil Law? The other members replied negatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Puno and Prof. Romero inquired if Article 37 should be retroactive or prospective in application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Diy opined that she was for its retroactivity because it is their answer to the problem of church annulments of marriages, which are still valid under the Civil Law. On the other hand, Justice Reyes and Justice Puno were concerned about the avalanche of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean Gupit suggested that they put the issue to a vote, which the Committee approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The members voted as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Justice Reyes, Justice Puno and Prof. Romero were for prospectivity.\n",
      "(2) Justice Caguioa, Judge Diy, Dean Gupit, Prof. Bautista and Director Eufemio were for retroactivity.\n",
      "(3) Prof. Baviera abstained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Caguioa suggested that they put in the prescriptive period of ten years within which the action for declaration of nullity of the marriage should be filed in court. The Committee approved the suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the foregoing, it can be gleaned that the Family Code Revision Committee actually took into consideration and voted on the retroactive application of Art. 36. In this regard, even if Arthur and Marlene’s marriage took place before the effectivity of the Family Code, the same can be declared void on the ground of Arthur’s psychological incapacity, as long as no vested or acquired rights are disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this score, it must be noted that the records are bereft of any indication that there were vested or acquired rights that were prejudiced or impaired in this case. As mentioned by Arthur in his Petition, “[d]uring their marriage, the spouses have not acquired real and personal properties of significant value.” It bears emphasis that if Marlene had an actual vested or acquired right that would be prejudiced should the Family Code be given retroactive effect, she should have raised such matter at the first possible instance or at any given stage of the proceedings where she was required to file an answer or comment. However, this she did not do. For failure to avail herself of the several opportunities given to her, she is deemed to have waived her right to prove and testify on such matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the petitioner also correctly pointed out that there have already been numerous cases promulgated by this Court where Art. 36 of the Family Code was applied even though the marriage involved was celebrated prior to August 3, 1988. As painstakingly enumerated by Arthur in his Motion for Reconsideration before the RTC:\n",
      "\n",
      "22. In Chi Ming Tsoi vs. CA and Gina Lao-Tsoi,\n",
      "\n",
      "23. In Republic vs. CA and Roridel Olaviano Molina,\n",
      "\n",
      "24. The marriage of Reynaldo Molina to Roridel Olaviano Molina may have been ruled subsisting and valid, but the Supreme Court did not find any issue with regard to the application of Article 36 of the Family Code in the said case, notwithstanding the fact that Reynaldo and Roridel were married on April 14, 1985, a date that falls BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988;\n",
      "\n",
      "25. It is not lost on PETITIONER that even the case of Marcos vs. Marcos cited by this Honorable Court in the assailed JUDGMENT involves a case in which the parties were married BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code, that is, the date of the marriage is September 6, 1982;\n",
      "\n",
      "26. In fact, there is a plethora of cases that reached the Supreme Court, which cases raised the issue of PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY of either or both parties, concerning marriages solemnized BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988, among which are the following:\n",

      "Further, the OSG also properly observed in its Comment that, “the ruling of the court a quo discriminates against married couples for no reason other than having had the misfortune of contracting their marriage earlier than 3 August 1998. There is no reason why it should be so, as all persons are prone to being afflicted by a psychological disorder that could cause a downright incapacity to perform the obligations of marriage. The question should not be when the party asking for dissolution got married, but whether such psychological incapacity in fact exists.”\n",
      "From the foregoing, the Court sees no reason why it should depart from its earlier rulings which recognized the applicability of Art. 36 even to those marriages celebrated prior the effectivity of the Family Code. Given this, the Court agrees with both petitioner and the OSG that the RTC erred when it held that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be nullified on the ground of psychological incapacity solely on the basis that the Family Code was not yet in effect then.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture, it must be recalled that the RTC actually found Arthur to be psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. It held that:\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the result of the psychiatric evaluation of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario by Dr. Daisy L. Chua Daquilanea preponderantly establishes that the petitioner is afflicted with a dependent personality disorder, a psychological incapacity characterized by severity or gravity, juridical antecedence and incurability, which has made the petitioner incognitive of the essential marital obligations of marriage that require the spouses to live together, observe mutual love, respect and fidelity, and render mutual help and support (Art. 68, Family Code; Republic vs. Iyoy, 470 SCRA 508). It is then obvious that before and at the time the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario and the respondent Marlene E. Candelario contracted marriage on June 11, 1984, the said petitioner was already psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, and the same still subsists as it is incurable such that their marriage would be void under Article 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the jurisprudential development established in Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan-Andal) leads this Court to re-examine the findings of the trial court.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Tan-Andal, the Court abandoned previous jurisprudence on psychological incapacity and categorically upheld that it is “neither a mental incapacity nor a personal disorder that must be proven through expert opinion.” Nevertheless, the Court added that proof must still be provided to show the durable or enduring aspects of a person’s personality, called “personality structure,” which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse’s personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations embedded in the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Court in Tan-Andal stated that these aspects of personality need not be given by an expert. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. What is important is that the plaintiff-spouse must prove his or her case with clear and convincing evidence, with the totality of evidence sufficient to support a finding of psychological incapacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be that as it may, the alleged psychological incapacity must still be shown to be grave, incurable, and juridically antecedent. First, gravity still has to be established, if only to preclude spouses from invoking mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts as ground for nullity. Second, incurability should also be understood in the legal sense. So long as the couple’s respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable breakdown of the marriage, the psychological incapacity of a spouse or both spouses is deemed “incurable.” Third, juridical antecedence or the existence of the condition prior to the celebration of marriage, is a statutory requirement which must be proven by the spouse alleging psychological incapacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying the foregoing in the instant case, the Court finds that no psychological incapacity exists on record to merit nullifying Arthur and Marlene’s marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Arthur presented the Psychiatric Report of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea who found that the former is suffering from Dependent Personality Disorder brought about by an overprotective upbringing which led him to have dependency, low self-esteem, and abandonment issues that affected his marriage with Marlene. To recall, such findings were based on the testimony of Arthur, Marlene, and three other informants who knew the couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this Court cannot accept such evidence as sufficient given that it failed to establish the gravity, incurability, and juridical antecedence of Arthur’s alleged incapacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reading of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s report reveals that her findings are lacking in data as to Arthur’s personality structure and how it incapacitates him to perform the essential marital obligations. Neither does it prove that Arthur’s psychological incapacity is due to a genuine psychic cause. While the report was detailed on how Arthur had a difficult upbringing, it failed to show that his condition made it practically impossible for him to comply with the ordinary duties required in marriage. It only offered a general assessment on the supposed effect of Arthur’s personality disorder to his marital union with Marlene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the Psychiatric Report stated that Arthur “had no regrets in this marriage and exerted no effort to save it” and that “during marriage, he carried with him the same attachment issues of his developmental years, imbibed as part of who he had become as a person.” It further added that:\n",
      "\n",
      "x x x In his marital life with her, he continued to grapple with self-doubts and low self-esteem, which were the core conflicts of an extremely dependent individual. When she left him to work abroad, he perceived this as loss or abandonment such that he could not cope with it because of his dependent personality disorder. He longed to have a constant dose of care and affection. Without her, he did not show consistent ability to assume responsibilities, like a simple work as a tricycle driver and farmer, to fend for his family and take care of their only daughter. He needed to always sustain attachment with another to prevent himself from feeling fearful of facing things on his own. Hence, he related with another woman. He brought this woman home and the respondent saw all these when she surprised him by an unannounced vacation. He failed to love, care, respect, render support and most of all, [show] fidelity to his spouse. She could not bear to remain connected with him who could not detach from other women and his vices. She did not want to continue the marital relationship with him and separated from him permanently. His dependent personality got in the way such that she opted to eventually separate from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, no other adequate explanation was provided to show that Arthur’s failure to assume his marital obligations was not because of his mere refusal, neglect, difficulty, or ill will. It is worthy to point out that Art. 36 of the Family Code contemplates downright incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations. It is not enough to prove that a spouse failed to meet his responsibilities and duties as a married person; the incapacity must be so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage. Here, it can be gleaned that Arthur simply made no real effort to work on his marriage with Marlene.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this, the Court finds that the requirement of gravity was not satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court also holds that the requirement of incurability was not sufficiently proven. Jurisprudence provides that in order for the said requisite to be met, there must be “an undeniable pattern of a persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse that must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.” Unfortunately, the Court finds that Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment of Arthur is wanting in this respect. While it was shown that Arthur had an extramarital affair while Marlene was working abroad, there was not enough evidence provided to prove that his incapacity or condition was incurable. Similar to the requirement on gravity, the report only made a general evaluation on the incurability of Arthur’s condition by stating that, “it was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the Court also finds that the requirement of juridical antecedence was not met. There was no sufficient evidence that Arthur’s alleged incapacity existed prior to his marriage to Marlene. While the Psychiatric Report cited the corroborative testimonies of Faustina, Cerina, and Rizalyn, the same do not indicate that they have known Arthur longer than such period of time as to have personal knowledge of his circumstances. It is not clear in the report that these persons had already been present in Arthur’s life before the latter contracted marriage to testify on his past experiences or environment while growing up that they have consistently observed which may have triggered his behavior towards Marlene.\n",
      "\n",
      "It bears emphasis that irreconcilable differences, conflicting personalities, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, physical abuse, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity or perversion, and abandonment, by themselves, do not warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 of the Family Code. It must be stressed that an unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, Arthur failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his personality disorder was one of psychological incapacity within the meaning of Art. 36 of the Family Code that would warrant the severance of Arthur and Marlene’s marital bonds. Failing in this regard, the Court must protect the sanctity of their marriage as mandated by the Constitution.\n",

Robles (Robles) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).\n",
      "The accusatory portion of the Information against Robles reads:\n",
      "That on or about the 27th day of July 2009, in the City of Tagbilaran, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above¬named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously drive without license an unregistered Suzuki Raiders  motorcycle with no plate number along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue, Tagbilaran City, in a careless, negligent and imprudent manner, in violation of the traffic rules and regulations and ordinances, without due regard to safety, life and property and without taking the necessary precautions to avoid accident to person or damage to property, thereby causing by such carelessness, negligence and imprudence said Suzuki Raiders motorcycle to hit and bump a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle bearing plate No. GL-6197 driven by Ronelo Franco Solas causing damage to the motorcycle in the amount of FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY PESOS ([P]4,570.00), Philippine Currency, causing death to the latter and less serious physical injuries to the backrider Renilda S. Dimpel, to wit: ‘ABRASION ON LEFT ILIAC & LUMBAR AREA, ABRASIONS ON LEFT FOREARM’ and which injuries have incapacitated or will incapacitate her from performing her customary labor for a period of seven (7) to ten (10) days barring complications not apparent at the time of examination, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of Ronelo Franco Solas and Renilda S. Dimpel.\n",
      "When arraigned on March 25, 2010, Robles pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. After the pre-trial was terminated, trial on the merits ensued.\n",
      "The Facts\n",
      "This case is rooted in a vehicular collision that happened between a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle driven by Ronelo Solas (Ronelo) and a Suzuki Raider motorcycle driven by Robles. The mishap occurred at the wee hours of July 27, 2009 in Tagbilaran City, particularly, along the intersection of Carlos P. Garcia North Avenue (CPG Avenue), a through street or highway, Calceta Street leading to the east, and Benigno Aquino Avenue (formerly Airport Road) leading to the northwest.\n",
      "As might be expected, the prosecution and defense had conflicting versions of how the mishap happened. The conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense, respectively, are as follows:\n",
      "Version of the Prosecution\n",
      "The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Renilda S. Dimpel (Renilda), Carmelino Franco Solas (Carmelina), and Arcadio Bendanillo.\n",
      "According to the prosecution, in the evening of July 26, 2009, Renilda was with the family of Carmelino in Tagbilaran City. At around 1:00 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Renilda decided to go home. Ronelo offered to take her home using a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle with Plate No. GL-6197. While they were navigating CPG Avenue, and upon reaching the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street, a speeding Suzuki Raider motorcycle, with no plate number, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street causing the collision of the two  motorcycles. Renilda and Ronelo were flung away as a result thereof.\n",
      "Robles was the driver of the Suzuki Raider motorcycle which collided with Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. Robles had no driver’s license and his motorcycle had no plate. He did not give assistance to Renilda or to the family of Ronelo.\n",
      "As a result of the collision, both Ronelo and Renilda were brought to Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital (Gallares Hospital). Ronelo, because his condition was critical, was later transferred to Ramiro Community Hospital. At around 9:20 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Ronelo died due to his injuries. Meanwhile, Renilda was transferred to Borja Family Hospital where she paid P19,533.50 for medical expenses. Her injuries healed within 7-14 days. Carmelina, Ronelo’s brother, stated that he paid for all the hospital, funeral, and burial expenses incurred by and for his brother, including attorney’s fees in the amount of P99,587.67 and P85,766.15. Ronelo had a professional driver’s license and the Yamaha Crypton  motorcycle he drove was duly registered.\n",
      "Arcadio Bendanillo, a habal-habal driver, corroborated the testimony of Renilda. He declared that he was near St. Jude Hospital when he saw a Suzuki Raider motorcycle cross CPG Avenue without stopping at the intersection, and thereafter colliding with a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. He later came to know the drivers of the Suzuki Raider and Yamaha Crypton motorcycles as Robles and Ronelo, respectively.\n",
      "Version of the Defense\n",
      "The defense presented eight witnesses, namely Robles, Bonifacio Dinampo (Dinampo), Police Officer 3 Fabio Maulas (PO3 Maulas), Dr. Glenn Eduard Oppus, Concordia Robles, Renan Lopos (Lopos), Alma Paelmao, and Dr. Isagani Jodi de los Santos (Dr. de los Santos).\n",
      "According to the defense, on July 27, 2009, at around 1:10 a.m., Robles was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue with Lopos as his back rider. Upon reaching the CPG Avenue — Benigno Aquino Avenue intersection, he signaled to turn left. But then, a speeding motorcycle driven by Ronelo, with back rider Renilda, suddenly came from behind him and without slowing down, attempted to overtake him, causing the collision of the two vehicles. The incident was witnessed by many people who were at the vicinity and who were interviewed by the responding policeman who came to the site to conduct an investigation. As a result of the incident, Robles suffered injuries and his motorcycle was damaged.\n",
      "Robles offered in evidence pictures showing the damages to his motorcycle, which were all on its left side. According to Robles, this negates the prosecution’s claim that he came from Calceta Street, because if the prosecution’s version is to be believed, then there would have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, but it had none. According to Robles, he was actually cruising along CPG Avenue, but when he was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, he was hit by Ronelo’s speeding motorcycle when the latter attempted to overtake him. Robles was also brought to Gallares Hospital for treatment and there he declared that he was hit by a speeding motorcycle.\n",
      "Dr. de los Santos, Ronelo’s attending physician at Ramiro Community Hospital, testified that, based on Ronelo’s admitting notes and history, as well as interviews taken of the persons accompanying Ronelo, Ronelo after having “a drinking spree with his friends” drove his motorcycle during which he collided with another motorcycle. He added that Ronelo “had this intoxicated or positive alcoholic breath” when he was examined at the hospital.\n",
      "Lopos, a holder of a driver’s license and who, at the time of the mishap, was Robles’ back rider, corroborated Robles’ testimony. The testimonies of Robles and Lopos were likewise corroborated by Dinampo, a habal-habal driver who witnessed the collision between the two  motorcycles. According to Dinampo, while he was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue near St. Jude Hospital with a passenger on board, he saw Robles, with back rider Lopos, signaling to the left when a speeding Yamaha Crypton  motorcycle driven by Ronelo bumped the motorcycle of Robles.\n",
      "PO3 Maulas testified that he, in his capacity as traffic investigator, conducted factual gathering and interviewed witnesses and bystanders available right after the incident, and prepared a police report and sketch based on his investigation. Based on his police report and sketch, the motorcycles driven by Robles and Ronelo, respectively, were actually travelling in the same direction of CPG North Avenue, both heading north, which was contrary to the claim of the prosecution witnesses that Robles came speeding from Calceta Street. When Robles, who was ahead at the intersection, made a signal to the left to turn towards Benigno Aquino Avenue, the speeding Yamaha Crypton motorcycle of Ronelo suddenly overtook at the left side, resulting in a collision of the two motorcycles in front of Saint Jude Hospital. Consistent with Robles’ testimony, PO3 Maulas’ police report indicates that Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle sustained damages on its left side while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side.\n",
      " [SEP] Issue\n",
      "The main question for resolution is whether Robles is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries, and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the RPC.\n",
      " [SEP] The Rulings of the MTCC and the RTC\n",
      "On February 9, 2012, the MTCC found Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge against him, and sentenced Robles to suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year of prision correccional as minimum to five (5) years of prision correccional as maximum. The MTCC found credible the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that Ronelo was driving along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, while Robles, coming from Calceta Street, suddenly crossed the intersection into CPG Avenue, thereby causing the collision, in violation of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code (Traffic Code), particularly Sections 42 (d) and 43 (c) thereof.\n",
      "The MTCC considered against Robles the circumstance that Robles was found to have been violating traffic rules, and hence presumed to be negligent. The MTCC noted that Robles was driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver-instructor. The MTCC also concluded that even if Robles’ version of the incident were to be believed, Robles would still be at fault — as Robles, before making a left turn, should have made sure that the road was clear of vehicles on both sides, and that had he done so, he “could have seen the fast speeding motorcycle behind which x x x according to him[,] attempted to overtake him.” As such, the MTCC disposed the case as follows:\n",
      "WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered finding accused John Michael Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ONE (1) YEAR of prison correccional as minimum to FIVE (5) YEARS of prison correccional as maximum and ordering the accused to pay the following:\n",
      "1.\tTo Renilda Dimpel the amount of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]20,000.00) as nominal damages;\n",
      "2.\tTo the Heirs of Ronelo Franco Solas in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]50,000.00) as death indemnity;\n",
      "3.\tTo Carmelino Franco Solas in the amount of ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE PESOS AND 82/100 ([P]102,653.82) as actual damages and temperate or moderate damages of THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS ([P]35,000).\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Petitioner appealed the MTCC Judgment before the RTC. The RTC, in a Decision dated November 29, 2012, sustained the ruling arrived at by the MTCC, and concluded that the latter’s findings were based on the evidence on record. On January 23, 2013, the RTC denied Robles’ motion for reconsideration. Robles thereafter appealed to the CA via a petition for review.\n",
      "The Ruling of the CA\n",
      "In the assailed Decision, the CA denied the appeal and held as follows:\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 29, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 48 of Tagbilaran City in Crim. Case No. 15640 convicting Michael John Robles for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "The CA found that there was nothing in the records which showed that the RTC, in affirming the Judgment of the MTCC, overlooked relevant and undisputed facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. Addressing Robles’ claim that he did not come from Calceta Street, and that instead, it was Ronelo who hit his  motorcycle when Ronelo attempted to overtake him, the CA likewise ruled that even if Robles’ claim is to be believed, the mishap would not have happened nonetheless, had Robles simply “been in the correct position on the road.”\n",
      "Hence, this recourse.\n",
      "In gist, Robles posits that it was Ronelo’s attempt to overtake him, while driving at a very fast speed and under the influence of alcohol, which was the proximate cause of the accident. Contrary to the prosecution’s claim, he did not come from Calceta Street. Rather, he was driving in the same direction as Ronelo along CPG Avenue heading north, and about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, when Ronelo, in the latter’s attempt to overtake Robles, hit Robles’ motorcycle. He argues in this regard that the findings of the police investigator and even the medical records, both of which corroborated his testimony, must be given credence, especially considering that these came from impartial sources.\n",
      "Finally, he also points out that even the Information filed by the prosecution alleges that both Robles and Ronelo came from the same direction. According to him, the deviation of the witnesses of the prosecution themselves from what was stated in the Information, not only violates his right to due process, but also puts in doubt the credibility of said witnesses.\n",
      "On February 8, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General filed its Comment to the Petition, where it reiterated that the findings of the lower courts are supported by the evidence on record.\n",
      "The Court’s Ruling\n",
      "\n",
      "The petition is impressed with merit.\n",
      "As a general rule, factual findings of the trial court are accorded great weight and respect especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court. However, as with every rule, there are exceptions. In the case of Quidet v. People, the Court held:\n",
      "x x x where the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can affect the result of the case, this Court is duty-bound to correct this palpable error for the right to liberty, which stands second only to life in the hierarchy of constitutional rights, cannot be lightly taken away. x x x\n",
      "In addition, it bears emphasis that “the Court, in the course of its review of criminal cases elevated to it, still commences its analysis from the fundamental principle that the accused before it is presumed innocent.” This presumption continues although the accused had been convicted in the trial court, as long as such conviction is still pending appeal.\n",
      "After going over the records of this case, the Court is unable to sustain the findings of fact and conclusion reached by the courts below. A careful review of the records inevitably leads to the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the crime charged against him.\n",
      " \n",
      "The defense version is more credible and deserves more weight and credit\t \n",
      "Reckless imprudence, as defined by our penal law, consists in voluntarily, but without malice, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place. It has the following elements: (1) that the offender does or fails to do an act; (2) that the doing or the failure to do that act is voluntary; (3) that it be done without malice; (4) that material damage results from the reckless imprudence; and (5) that there is inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the offender, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition, and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.\n",
      "Here, the lower courts found to be credible Renilda’s testimony that Ronelo was cruising along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, and that Robles, in violation of traffic laws, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street. This appears to be the lower courts’ assessment of Robles’ guilt, considering that Section 42(d) and Section 43(c) of the Traffic Code, require a driver of a  vehicle entering a “through highway” to bring to a full stop such vehicle prior to entering, and to yield the right of way to  vehicles approaching in either direction on such through highway. Thus, according to the lower courts, Robles “should have given way to Ronelo Solas who was negotiating a through street or highway.”\n",
      "The Court, however, disagrees. The Court finds that the premise for the lower courts’ finding is erroneous.\n",
      "First, PO3 Maulas’ findings, which were reflected in his police report and sketch and which he thereafter repeated in open court, are clear and categorical that Robles did not, in fact, come from Calceta Street. Rather, at the time of the incident, he was driving along CPG Avenue heading north, and was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue at the intersection when Ronelo attempted to overtake him.\n",
      "In PO3 Maulas’ police report, which he prepared immediately after the incident, and which was duly recorded in the traffic blotter of the Philippine National Police, Tagbilaran City Police Station, he reported that:\n",
      "Further investigation revealed that the two motorcycle[s] involved were travelling on the same direction along CPG North Avenue heading towards North and upon reaching in front of St. Jude Hospital they collided with each other, when the Suzuki Raider MC which was ahead signaled and about to turn left towards B. Aquino Avenue while the speeding Yamaha MC suddenly overtook at the left side.\n",
      "Likewise, PO3 Maulas’ testimony was categorical that based on his investigation, Robles actually came from CPG Avenue, and not from Calceta Street. In other words, his findings directly contradicted Renilda’s testimony. He testified that:\n",
      "[Direct examination of PO3 Maulas by Atty. Cristifil D. Baluma]\n",

      "\t\n",
      "A:\tBecause based on the investigation there was no indication that the other motorcycle came from that road Calceta Street because if ever the collision happened in that particular point he would be thrown to the other portion of the road.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n",
      "PO3 Maulas’ police report and sketch also indicated that Robles’ Suzuki Raider  motorcycle sustained damages on its left side while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side. He testified on this point that:\n",

      "It bears stressing that PO3 Maulas did not simply wrest his findings out of thin air. As testified by him, said findings were based on his interviews with various bystanders and witnesses, on the damages actually sustained by the two  motorcycles, and on his own independent assessment of the relative positions of the vehicles when he arrived at the scene of the accident. Ultimately, based on the totality of such evidence, PO3 Maulas categorically concluded that Renilda’s version is “very far from the truth,” “very remote,” and, in fact, “impossible.”\n",
      "Indeed, the damages sustained by the two motorcycles, as well as the relative positions of the motorcycles, as observed by PO3 Maulas and inferred from said damages, constitute real evidence that ranks higher in the hierarchy of evidence compared to testimonial evidence.\n",
      "It is well-settled that object or physical evidence, when offered in accordance with the requisites for its admissibility, becomes evidence of the highest order and speaks more eloquently than witnesses put together. It has been characterized as “that mute but eloquent manifestations of truth which rate high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence,” such that “where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimonial evidence of the prosecution witnesses, x x x the physical evidence should prevail.” Thus, in People v. Vasquez, this Court refused to lend credence to the incriminating assertions of prosecution witnesses as to an alleged mauling, and stated that “[t]his Court cannot be persuaded by the prosecution’s claim of perpetration of physical violence in the absence of any marked physical injuries on the various parts of the victim’s face and body.”\n",
      "The same principle finds relevance here, considering that the physical evidence belies the prosecution’s testimonial evidence.\n",
      "Yet, neither the MTCC, the RTC, nor the CA attempted to remotely discuss why the findings of PO3 Maulas, and more importantly, the nature and locations of the damages sustained by the said motorcycles, did not at all warrant any consideration. In convicting Robles, the lower courts simply and solely relied on Renilda’s testimony, which they precipitously concluded to be credible, without any explanation as to why such version deserves more credence than the traffic investigator’s investigation report. On this score, the Court finds the lower courts to have been mistaken and, to a degree, remiss in the performance of their duties.\n",
      "Second, PO3 Maulas’ account has in its favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, which presumption the prosecution utterly failed to overturn.\n",
      "In Yap v. Lagtapon, the Court described the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties in this wise:\n",
      "The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties is an aid to the effective and unhampered administration of government functions. Without such benefit, every official action could be negated with minimal effort from litigants, irrespective of merit or sufficiency of evidence to support such challenge. To this end, our body of jurisprudence has been consistent in requiring nothing short of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary to overthrow such presumption. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "The presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty. Conversely, unless the official act in question is irregular on its face, or where the records suggest that the law enforcers involved deviated from the standard conduct of official duty as provided for in the law, the presumption prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Thus, unless the presumption is rebutted, it becomes conclusive.\n",
      "Here, the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to show any deficiency or irregularity on the part of PO3 Maulas in the performance of his official duty as the traffic investigator of the accident. Also, the prosecution did not show that he was impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely. As such, PO3 Maulas’ investigation report has in its favor the presumption that official duty had regularly been performed, and thus entitled to weight and respect.\n",
      " \n",
      "Notably, the prosecution simply harped on the fact that PO3 Maulas did not actually witness the accident. However, the Court has time and again given weight to the report of the traffic or investigating officer in cases involving vehicular accidents, even if the investigating officer did not actually witness the accident. In Serra v. Mumar, which involved a civil action for damages in relation to a charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, the Court upheld the traffic investigator’s report despite the investigator not having been an actual eyewitness, thus:\n",
      "Petitioner insists that the traffic investigator SPO3 Haran Abdullatip’s report should be disregarded because he was not at the scene when the accident happened.\n",
      "Rarely does it happen that the investigating officer personally witnesses an accident that he investigates, yet this does not mean that his observations are not valid. A traffic investigator’s training and experience allow him to determine how an accident occurred even without witnessing the accident himself.\n",
      "In this case, Abdullatip had been a traffic investigator for nine years. Even if he arrived at the scene after the accident, he saw the  vehicles in their relative positions as a result of the accident. His experience, as well as his evaluation of the statements from various witnesses, guided him in assessing who was at fault. In any case, the presumption of regularity in the exercise of functions is in his favor and therefore his report must be given credence. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n",
      "Similarly, in BJDC Construction v. Lanuzo, which involved a civil action for damages arising from a road accident, the Court upheld the contents of the police officer’s investigation report as it enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of the police officer’s duties. This presumption was upheld by the Court in this case, as no evidence was adduced to show any deficiency or irregularity in the performance of the police officer’s official duty as the police investigator of the accident, and that it was not shown that he was “impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, in Manuel v. Court of Appeals, which involved a civil action based on quasi-delict, therein petitioners questioned the accuracy of the sketches prepared by the police investigator, as “it was prepared the day after the incident and the alleged ‘tell-tale’ skid marks and other details had already been obliterated by the heavy downpour which lasted for at least an hour after the accident.” The Court, however, rejected this assertion, as the “strong presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty x x x erases, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, any suspicions that the police investigator just invented the skid marks indicated in his report.”\n",
      "Finally, in Caminos, Jr. v. People (Caminos), the Court even convicted therein accused of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property based on, among others, the entries in the traffic accident investigation report (TAIR) and sketch made by the traffic investigator depicting the post-collision positions of the two vehicles. In convicting therein accused, the Court noted that the “TAIR itself shows that petitioner approached the intersection in excess of lawful speed x x x which raises the presumption of imprudent driving x x x.”\n",
      "The foregoing principles find utmost relevance here, especially considering that the traffic investigator’s findings, rather than implicate, actually exonerate the accused.\n",
      "Certainly, in criminal cases, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot, by itself, overcome the superior presumption of innocence. Corollarily, if the official findings actually favor the accused, then such findings, if unrebutted, should inevitably yield the acquittal of the accused. After all, if the “facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his [or her] guilt, then the evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty and will not suffice to support a conviction.” Indeed, while the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot preponderate over the presumption of innocence, which prevails if not overthrown by proof beyond reasonable doubt, with much more reason should this presumption, if unrebutted, be considered “binding truth” in favor of the accused, especially considering that the accused is protected by the overwhelming presumption of innocence.\n",
      "Third, contrasting the two versions of the incident, the Court finds the version of Renilda incredible, contrary to the findings of the lower courts.\n",
      "Indeed, as correctly pointed out by PO3 Maulas, had Robles come speeding from Calceta Street and, in doing so, hit Ronelo’s  motorcycle which resulted in Ronelo and Renilda getting flung away, then the point of impact should not have been in front of St. Jude Hospital, which is located at the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street, but rather somewhere further at the middle of the said intersection. In addition, based on the prosecution’s version of the facts, had Robles’s Suzuki Raider motorcycle “hit and bump[ed]” Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle, there should likewise have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, and not on its left side where the change pedal is located.\n",
      "The relative positions of the two  vehicles at the point of impact and thereafter, as reflected in PO3 Maulas’ sketch below, likewise lead to the conclusion that Ronelo was the one who hit Robles and was, in fact, driving at a much faster speed.\n",
      "That Robles and his motorcycle were thrown further to the north (forward into CPG Avenue) would also indicate that Robles had indeed slowed down, while Ronelo, having gained much momentum, was thrown upon impact. Moreover, had Renilda’s version been true, then Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton should have been flung toward either CPG Avenue or further to the side of Benigno Aquino Avenue, instead of forward into CPG Avenue, as indicated in the sketch.\n",
      "Even more telling is the fact that the Information itself alleges that Robles was driving “along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue,” consistent with PO3 Maulas’ findings. If Robles really came from the east at Calceta Street and crossed through CPG Avenue at the intersection, as claimed by the prosecution, then why was this not alleged in the Information? Indeed, a defective Information which lacks certain essential allegations may still sustain a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial, and the deficiency was cured by competent evidence presented therein. However, that the Information itself contradicts the prosecution’s evidence, and supports the defense’s version of events, as here, further lends to the conclusion that the latter’s account is indeed more consistent with how the events actually transpired. To be sure, that the prosecution presented a version contrary to that stated in the Information undeniably puts in doubt the entire version of the prosecution as to what truthfully happened. As well, it lends credence to the version of the defense as testified to by Robles, PO3 Maulas, and the other defense witnesses.\n",
      "Accordingly, a thorough reading of the records of the case induces the Court to believe and approve the defense’s version of the incident. In checkered contrast, the Court finds the version of the prosecution doubtful and incongruous with reality.\n",
      " \n",
      "A causal connection between Robles’ negligence and the injuries or damages complained of was not proven beyond reasonable doubt\t \n",
      "Notwithstanding the obvious gaps in the prosecution’s evidence, the lower courts alternatively hinge Robles’ conviction on their finding that Robles was then driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver, for which reason, according to the lower courts, he would be presumed to be negligent under Article 2185 of the Civil Code.\n",
      "Again, the Court disagrees.\n",
      " \n",
      "Gonzaga v. People, and more recently, Ofracio v. People instruct that in order to establish a motorist’s liability for the negligent operation of a  vehicle, it must be shown that there was a direct causal connection between such negligence and the injuries or damages complained of. Otherwise stated, mere negligence, presumed or otherwise, does not warrant a conviction under Article 365 of the RPC, as a direct causal connection must additionally be shown between the accused’s negligence and the accident. In the same light, the Court, in Valencia v. People, further held that mere negligence will not suffice because it is the motorist’s willful and wanton act done in utter disregard of the consequence of his or her action, which criminalizes an imprudent or negligent act.\n",
      "Likewise, Añonuevo v. Court of Appeals clarifies that while the violation of a statute may establish some degree of negligence, pursuant to Article 2185 of the Civil Code, the complainant must nevertheless show that the violation of the statute was the proximate or legal cause of the injury, or that it substantially contributed thereto. After all, negligence consisting in whole or in part, of violation of law, like any other negligence, is without legal consequence unless it is a contributing cause of the injury.\n",
      "From the foregoing premises, it thus cannot be said that Robles could be presumed negligent, considering that there is no causal connection that could be reasonably drawn between his violations — lack of driver’s license and driving an unregistered vehicle — and the proximate cause of the accident. Additionally, there is also no evidence that the violations even contributed to the accident.\n",
      "In this connection, the Court notes that the lower courts failed to consider that Robles was, at the time of the mishap, actually accompanied by a back rider in the person of Lopos, a duly licensed driver. In fact, the RTC in the instant case even took judicial notice of the Decision rendered in Crim. Case No. 14906, wherein Robles was acquitted of the criminal offense of driving without a license because he was actually accompanied by Lopos, “a duly licensed driver.” Hence, that Robles only had a student driver’s permit could not at the onset give rise to a presumption that he was negligent, considering that the Traffic Code explicitly allows a student driver to operate a motor vehicle when accompanied by a duly licensed driver.\n",
      "The foregoing discussions point to no other conclusion than that Robles is not guilty of the crime charged and should consequently be acquitted.\n",
      " \n",
      "Robles’ conviction may not be sustained based on an alternative set of facts not supported by the prosecution’s evidence\n",
      "Finally, to support Robles’ conviction, the CA nonetheless holds that even if Robles’ version were to be believed, he nevertheless should have complied with Section 45(b) of the Traffic Code, which necessitated that he correctly positioned himself “nearest to the center line of the highway” prior to making a left turn, and that he be on the proper lookout for incoming  vehicles. “Had he done so,” the CA concludes, “he could have seen the fast speeding  motorcycle behind which x x x according to him, attempted to overtake him.” Thus, the CA finds Robles guilty of the crime charged as “had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened.”\n",
      "Again, the Court disagrees.\n",
      "Notably, the bulk of the CA’s assailed Decision was centered on justifying Robles’ conviction, if his claim “will be believed that he was also cruising along CPG Avenue when he was hit by the motorcycle driven by Solas on his left side.” It did not, at all, touch on why Robles should be convicted based on the facts as actually presented by the prosecution.\n",
      "On this score, the CA obviously overlooked that under the defense’s version of the incident: (1) both parties were approaching the intersection from the same direction, (2) thereafter, Robles signaled his intention to turn left, (3) Ronelo, meanwhile, was speeding in his attempt to overtake Robles, and (4) such attempt on the part of Ronelo to overtake caused the collision. Likewise on record is Dr. de los Santos’ testimony finding Ronelo to have been “intoxicated” at the time of this accident. Given these alternative set of facts, it cannot simply be concluded that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have occurred. These are just speculations. There are various other factors at play in a vehicular accident, as here, such as the relative distances and speeds of the two vehicles in their approach of the intersection — which, for obvious reasons, the prosecution, in this case, had not been able to address under the said “alternative” version of the facts.\n",
      "On this point, the Court’s ruling in Ladeco v. Angala, finds relevance. In that case, a pick-up truck running along the outer lane was slowing down to about five to 10 kilometers per hour (kph) and was making a left turn preparatory to turning south, or a U-turn, when it was bumped from behind by the crewcab which was running along the inner lane at around 60 to 70 kph. Interestingly, the owner of the crewcab alleged therein, as the CA holds in the present case, that the driver of the pick-up did not take the proper lane before executing the U-turn, in violation of Section 45(b) of Traffic Code and hence, it was the latter’s recklessness that was the proximate cause of the accident. The Court, disagreeing with the CA, held that the parties were both negligent, as while the pick-up truck was not in the correct lane, the accident would not have happened if the driver of the crewcab was not driving very fast. The Court went further to say that the crewcab, based on the doctrine of last clear chance, was ultimately at fault. Said the Court:\n",
      "Since both parties are at fault in this case, the doctrine of last clear chance applies.\n",
      "The doctrine of last clear chance states that where both parties are negligent but the negligent act of one is appreciably later than that of the other, or where it is impossible to determine whose fault or negligence caused the loss, the one who had the last clear opportunity to avoid the loss but failed to do so is chargeable with the loss. In this case, Deocampo had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. Since Deocampo was driving the rear  vehicle, he had full control of the situation since he was in a position to observe the vehicle in front of him. Deocampo had the responsibility of avoiding bumping the vehicle in front of him. A U-turn is done at a much slower speed to avoid skidding and overturning, compared to running straight ahead. Deocampo could have avoided the vehicle if he was not driving very fast while following the pick-up. Deocampo was not only driving fast, he also admitted that he did not step on the  brakes even upon seeing the pick-up. He only stepped on the brakes after the collision. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n",
      "Further, in Caminos, the Court likewise clarified that the right of way rule, as stated in Section 42 of the Traffic Code, is applicable in instances where two colliding vehicles are approaching the intersection at approximately the same time.\n",
      "In Caminos, the Court held that whether one of the drivers has the right of way or, as sometimes stated, has the status of a favored driver on the highway, is a question that permeates a situation where the vehicles approach the crossing so nearly at the same time and at such distances and speed that if either of them proceeds without regard to the other a collision is likely to occur. Nevertheless, the right of way accorded to vehicles approaching an intersection is by no means a legal straitjacket, and is subject to and is affected by the relative distances of the vehicles from the point of intersection, and their respective speeds. Notably, the Court here declared that “it is much unsafe as it is unjust to assume” that the one making a left turn had performed a risky maneuver at the intersection in simply “failing to keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles.“\n",
      "Likewise, in Adzuara v. Court of Appeals, a criminal case involving reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with less serious physical injuries, it was established that a motorist crossing a through stop street has the right of way over the one making a turn; but if the person making the turn has already negotiated half of the turn and is almost on the other side so that he or she is already visible to the person on the through street, the latter, having the last clear chance to avoid the accident, is bound to give way to the former.\n",
      "In sum, a motorist’s liability for a road accident is not determined simply by who among the parties had the right of way or was in the proper lane. Rather, the same is determined by various factors, which include, among others, the relative distances and respective speeds of the vehicles, or who among the parties had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.\n",
      "To stress, here, the prosecution, and later the lower courts, proceeded on the theory that Robles came from Calceta Street, and not CPG Avenue. As such, the prosecution did not, at all, present any evidence as to the speed and distance of Robles relative to Ronelo, had Robles come from CPG Avenue, and whether such directly caused, or at least materially contributed to, the injuries or damages complained of. Thus, the CA erred in justifying Robles’ conviction based simply on the alternative speculative theory that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened. This undoubtedly does not satisfy the core requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n",
      "To be sure, in a prosecution for reckless driving, the contributory negligence of the person who was injured or who was the driver of the motor  vehicle with which the accused’s vehicle collided does not constitute a complete defense. However, it is likewise true that a conviction must rest on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence, and not on the weakness — or in this case, the strength — of the defense.\n",
      "All told, the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the act and ultimately, the crime, for which he is being charged. The prosecution likewise neither established that Robles committed inexcusable lack of precaution in driving his  motorcycle, nor proved that his alleged negligence was the legal cause of the injury complained of.\n",
      "Based on the abovementioned premises, the Court is likewise unable to sustain the award of damages in favor of Renilda, Carmelino, and the heirs of Ronelo, considering that the prosecution failed to prove that Robles committed the act complained of. On this score, the Court also notes that Robles submitted before this Court affidavits of desistance respectively executed by Renilda and Carmelino, wherein both of them waived their respective claims for damages and indemnity against Robles.\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. CEB-CR No. 02067 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Michael John Robles is hereby ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove that he committed the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt. If detained, he is ordered immediately RELEASED, unless he is confined for any other lawful cause. Any amount paid by way of a bailbond is ordered RETURNED. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately.\n",
      "This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Petition) filed on May 7, 2016 pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from the Decision dated August 27, 2015 (assailed Decision) of the Court of Appeals (CA) Twentieth (20th) Division and Resolution dated February 29, 2016 of the CA Former Twentieth (20th) Division in C.A.-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02067. The assailed Decision affirmed the Decision dated November 29, 2012 rendered by Branch 48, Regional Trial Court of Tagbilaran City (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 15640 (RTC Decision), which, in turn, affirmed the Judgment dated February 9, 2012 rendered by Branch 2, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Tagbilaran City (MTCC) in Criminal Case No. 17603 (MTCC Judgment) which found petitioner Michael John N. Robles (Robles) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).\n",
      "The accusatory portion of the Information against Robles reads:\n",
      "That on or about the 27th day of July 2009, in the City of Tagbilaran, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above¬named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously drive without license an unregistered Suzuki Raiders  motorcycle with no plate number along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue, Tagbilaran City, in a careless, negligent and imprudent manner, in violation of the traffic rules and regulations and ordinances, without due regard to safety, life and property and without taking the necessary precautions to avoid accident to person or damage to property, thereby causing by such carelessness, negligence and imprudence said Suzuki Raiders motorcycle to hit and bump a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle bearing plate No. GL-6197 driven by Ronelo Franco Solas causing damage to the motorcycle in the amount of FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY PESOS ([P]4,570.00), Philippine Currency, causing death to the latter and less serious physical injuries to the backrider Renilda S. Dimpel, to wit: ‘ABRASION ON LEFT ILIAC & LUMBAR AREA, ABRASIONS ON LEFT FOREARM’ and which injuries have incapacitated or will incapacitate her from performing her customary labor for a period of seven (7) to ten (10) days barring complications not apparent at the time of examination, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of Ronelo Franco Solas and Renilda S. Dimpel.\n",
      "When arraigned on March 25, 2010, Robles pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. After the pre-trial was terminated, trial on the merits ensued.\n",
      "The Facts\n",
      "This case is rooted in a vehicular collision that happened between a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle driven by Ronelo Solas (Ronelo) and a Suzuki Raider motorcycle driven by Robles. The mishap occurred at the wee hours of July 27, 2009 in Tagbilaran City, particularly, along the intersection of Carlos P. Garcia North Avenue (CPG Avenue), a through street or highway, Calceta Street leading to the east, and Benigno Aquino Avenue (formerly Airport Road) leading to the northwest.\n",
      "As might be expected, the prosecution and defense had conflicting versions of how the mishap happened. The conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense, respectively, are as follows:\n",
      "Version of the Prosecution\n",
      "The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Renilda S. Dimpel (Renilda), Carmelino Franco Solas (Carmelina), and Arcadio Bendanillo.\n",
      "According to the prosecution, in the evening of July 26, 2009, Renilda was with the family of Carmelino in Tagbilaran City. At around 1:00 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Renilda decided to go home. Ronelo offered to take her home using a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle with Plate No. GL-6197. While they were navigating CPG Avenue, and upon reaching the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street, a speeding Suzuki Raider motorcycle, with no plate number, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street causing the collision of the two  motorcycles. Renilda and Ronelo were flung away as a result thereof.\n",
      "Robles was the driver of the Suzuki Raider motorcycle which collided with Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. Robles had no driver’s license and his motorcycle had no plate. He did not give assistance to Renilda or to the family of Ronelo.\n",
      "As a result of the collision, both Ronelo and Renilda were brought to Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital (Gallares Hospital). Ronelo, because his condition was critical, was later transferred to Ramiro Community Hospital. At around 9:20 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Ronelo died due to his injuries. Meanwhile, Renilda was transferred to Borja Family Hospital where she paid P19,533.50 for medical expenses. Her injuries healed within 7-14 days. Carmelina, Ronelo’s brother, stated that he paid for all the hospital, funeral, and burial expenses incurred by and for his brother, including attorney’s fees in the amount of P99,587.67 and P85,766.15. Ronelo had a professional driver’s license and the Yamaha Crypton  motorcycle he drove was duly registered.\n",
      "Arcadio Bendanillo, a habal-habal driver, corroborated the testimony of Renilda. He declared that he was near St. Jude Hospital when he saw a Suzuki Raider motorcycle cross CPG Avenue without stopping at the intersection, and thereafter colliding with a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. He later came to know the drivers of the Suzuki Raider and Yamaha Crypton motorcycles as Robles and Ronelo, respectively.\n",
      "Version of the Defense\n",
      "The defense presented eight witnesses, namely Robles, Bonifacio Dinampo (Dinampo), Police Officer 3 Fabio Maulas (PO3 Maulas), Dr. Glenn Eduard Oppus, Concordia Robles, Renan Lopos (Lopos), Alma Paelmao, and Dr. Isagani Jodi de los Santos (Dr. de los Santos).\n",
      "According to the defense, on July 27, 2009, at around 1:10 a.m., Robles was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue with Lopos as his back rider. Upon reaching the CPG Avenue — Benigno Aquino Avenue intersection, he signaled to turn left. But then, a speeding motorcycle driven by Ronelo, with back rider Renilda, suddenly came from behind him and without slowing down, attempted to overtake him, causing the collision of the two vehicles. The incident was witnessed by many people who were at the vicinity and who were interviewed by the responding policeman who came to the site to conduct an investigation. As a result of the incident, Robles suffered injuries and his motorcycle was damaged.\n",
      "Robles offered in evidence pictures showing the damages to his motorcycle, which were all on its left side. According to Robles, this negates the prosecution’s claim that he came from Calceta Street, because if the prosecution’s version is to be believed, then there would have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, but it had none. According to Robles, he was actually cruising along CPG Avenue, but when he was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, he was hit by Ronelo’s speeding motorcycle when the latter attempted to overtake him. Robles was also brought to Gallares Hospital for treatment and there he declared that he was hit by a speeding motorcycle.\n",
      "Dr. de los Santos, Ronelo’s attending physician at Ramiro Community Hospital, testified that, based on Ronelo’s admitting notes and history, as well as interviews taken of the persons accompanying Ronelo, Ronelo after having “a drinking spree with his friends” drove his motorcycle during which he collided with another motorcycle. He added that Ronelo “had this intoxicated or positive alcoholic breath” when he was examined at the hospital.\n",
      "Lopos, a holder of a driver’s license and who, at the time of the mishap, was Robles’ back rider, corroborated Robles’ testimony. The testimonies of Robles and Lopos were likewise corroborated by Dinampo, a habal-habal driver who witnessed the collision between the two  motorcycles. According to Dinampo, while he was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue near St. Jude Hospital with a passenger on board, he saw Robles, with back rider Lopos, signaling to the left when a speeding Yamaha Crypton  motorcycle driven by Ronelo bumped the motorcycle of Robles.\n",
      "PO3 Maulas testified that he, in his capacity as traffic investigator, conducted factual gathering and interviewed witnesses and bystanders available right after the incident, and prepared a police report and sketch based on his investigation. Based on his police report and sketch, the motorcycles driven by Robles and Ronelo, respectively, were actually travelling in the same direction of CPG North Avenue, both heading north, which was contrary to the claim of the prosecution witnesses that Robles came speeding from Calceta Street. When Robles, who was ahead at the intersection, made a signal to the left to turn towards Benigno Aquino Avenue, the speeding Yamaha Crypton motorcycle of Ronelo suddenly overtook at the left side, resulting in a collision of the two motorcycles in front of Saint Jude Hospital. Consistent with Robles’ testimony, PO3 Maulas’ police report indicates that Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle sustained damages on its left side while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side.\n",
      "The Rulings of the MTCC and the RTC\n",
      "On February 9, 2012, the MTCC found Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge against him, and sentenced Robles to suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year of prision correccional as minimum to five (5) years of prision correccional as maximum. The MTCC found credible the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that Ronelo was driving along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, while Robles, coming from Calceta Street, suddenly crossed the intersection into CPG Avenue, thereby causing the collision, in violation of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code (Traffic Code), particularly Sections 42 (d) and 43 (c) thereof.\n",
      "The MTCC considered against Robles the circumstance that Robles was found to have been violating traffic rules, and hence presumed to be negligent. The MTCC noted that Robles was driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver-instructor. The MTCC also concluded that even if Robles’ version of the incident were to be believed, Robles would still be at fault — as Robles, before making a left turn, should have made sure that the road was clear of vehicles on both sides, and that had he done so, he “could have seen the fast speeding motorcycle behind which x x x according to him[,] attempted to overtake him.” As such, the MTCC disposed the case as follows:\n",
      "WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered finding accused John Michael Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ONE (1) YEAR of prison correccional as minimum to FIVE (5) YEARS of prison correccional as maximum and ordering the accused to pay the following:\n",
      "1.\tTo Renilda Dimpel the amount of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]20,000.00) as nominal damages;\n",

      "Petitioner appealed the MTCC Judgment before the RTC. The RTC, in a Decision dated November 29, 2012, sustained the ruling arrived at by the MTCC, and concluded that the latter’s findings were based on the evidence on record. On January 23, 2013, the RTC denied Robles’ motion for reconsideration. Robles thereafter appealed to the CA via a petition for review.\n",
      "The Ruling of the CA\n",
      "In the assailed Decision, the CA denied the appeal and held as follows:\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 29, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 48 of Tagbilaran City in Crim. Case No. 15640 convicting Michael John Robles for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "The CA found that there was nothing in the records which showed that the RTC, in affirming the Judgment of the MTCC, overlooked relevant and undisputed facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. Addressing Robles’ claim that he did not come from Calceta Street, and that instead, it was Ronelo who hit his  motorcycle when Ronelo attempted to overtake him, the CA likewise ruled that even if Robles’ claim is to be believed, the mishap would not have happened nonetheless, had Robles simply “been in the correct position on the road.”\n",
      "Hence, this recourse.\n",
      "In gist, Robles posits that it was Ronelo’s attempt to overtake him, while driving at a very fast speed and under the influence of alcohol, which was the proximate cause of the accident. Contrary to the prosecution’s claim, he did not come from Calceta Street. Rather, he was driving in the same direction as Ronelo along CPG Avenue heading north, and about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, when Ronelo, in the latter’s attempt to overtake Robles, hit Robles’ motorcycle. He argues in this regard that the findings of the police investigator and even the medical records, both of which corroborated his testimony, must be given credence, especially considering that these came from impartial sources.\n",
      "Finally, he also points out that even the Information filed by the prosecution alleges that both Robles and Ronelo came from the same direction. According to him, the deviation of the witnesses of the prosecution themselves from what was stated in the Information, not only violates his right to due process, but also puts in doubt the credibility of said witnesses.\n",
      "On February 8, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General filed its Comment to the Petition, where it reiterated that the findings of the lower courts are supported by the evidence on record.\n",
      "Issue\n",
      "The main question for resolution is whether Robles is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries, and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the RPC.\n",
      "The Court’s Ruling\n",
      "\n",
      "The petition is impressed with merit.\n",
      "As a general rule, factual findings of the trial court are accorded great weight and respect especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court. However, as with every rule, there are exceptions. In the case of Quidet v. People, the Court held:\n",
      "x x x where the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can affect the result of the case, this Court is duty-bound to correct this palpable error for the right to liberty, which stands second only to life in the hierarchy of constitutional rights, cannot be lightly taken away. x x x\n",
      "In addition, it bears emphasis that “the Court, in the course of its review of criminal cases elevated to it, still commences its analysis from the fundamental principle that the accused before it is presumed innocent.” This presumption continues although the accused had been convicted in the trial court, as long as such conviction is still pending appeal.\n",
      "After going over the records of this case, the Court is unable to sustain the findings of fact and conclusion reached by the courts below. A careful review of the records inevitably leads to the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the crime charged against him.\n",
      " \n",
      "The defense version is more credible and deserves more weight and credit\t \n",
      "Reckless imprudence, as defined by our penal law, consists in voluntarily, but without malice, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place. It has the following elements: (1) that the offender does or fails to do an act; (2) that the doing or the failure to do that act is voluntary; (3) that it be done without malice; (4) that material damage results from the reckless imprudence; and (5) that there is inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the offender, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition, and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.\n",
      "Here, the lower courts found to be credible Renilda’s testimony that Ronelo was cruising along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, and that Robles, in violation of traffic laws, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street. This appears to be the lower courts’ assessment of Robles’ guilt, considering that Section 42(d) and Section 43(c) of the Traffic Code, require a driver of a  vehicle entering a “through highway” to bring to a full stop such vehicle prior to entering, and to yield the right of way to  vehicles approaching in either direction on such through highway. Thus, according to the lower courts, Robles “should have given way to Ronelo Solas who was negotiating a through street or highway.”\n",
      "The Court, however, disagrees. The Court finds that the premise for the lower courts’ finding is erroneous.\n",
      "First, PO3 Maulas’ findings, which were reflected in his police report and sketch and which he thereafter repeated in open court, are clear and categorical that Robles did not, in fact, come from Calceta Street. Rather, at the time of the incident, he was driving along CPG Avenue heading north, and was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue at the intersection when Ronelo attempted to overtake him.\n",
      "In PO3 Maulas’ police report, which he prepared immediately after the incident, and which was duly recorded in the traffic blotter of the Philippine National Police, Tagbilaran City Police Station, he reported that:\n",
      "Further investigation revealed that the two motorcycle[s] involved were travelling on the same direction along CPG North Avenue heading towards North and upon reaching in front of St. Jude Hospital they collided with each other, when the Suzuki Raider MC which was ahead signaled and about to turn left towards B. Aquino Avenue while the speeding Yamaha MC suddenly overtook at the left side.\n",
      "Likewise, PO3 Maulas’ testimony was categorical that based on his investigation, Robles actually came from CPG Avenue, and not from Calceta Street. In other words, his findings directly contradicted Renilda’s testimony. He testified that:\n",

      "\t\n",
      "A:\tBecause based on the investigation there was no indication that the other motorcycle came from that road Calceta Street because if ever the collision happened in that particular point he would be thrown to the other portion of the road. He must be thrown to the North CGP Avenue which is ahead of the intersection not in this portion which is different from my sketch where this portion that the vehicle was thrown is the intersection of Calceta and CPG Avenue. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n",
      "PO3 Maulas’ police report and sketch also indicated that Robles’ Suzuki Raider  motorcycle sustained damages on its left side while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side. He testified on this point that:\n",

      "Notably, such findings are likewise reflected in the photographs of Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle taken after the incident, which indicate that the motorcycle sustained damages only on its left side, particularly on the change pedal and driver’s left foot rest.\n",
      "More importantly, on cross examination, PO3 Maulas was unwavering that despite interviewing both Renilda and Robles, he found Robles’ account to be more consistent with his factual findings, while Renilda’s account was, in his view, improbable. Thus:\n",

It is also possible?\n",
      "\t\n",
      "A:\tIt is very remote Sir. Because what was being hit was the change pedal of the Suzuki Raiders. So, it could be impossible if it goes left side ways. It must be in the right. (Emphasis supplied and underscoring)\n",
      "It bears stressing that PO3 Maulas did not simply wrest his findings out of thin air. As testified by him, said findings were based on his interviews with various bystanders and witnesses, on the damages actually sustained by the two  motorcycles, and on his own independent assessment of the relative positions of the vehicles when he arrived at the scene of the accident. Ultimately, based on the totality of such evidence, PO3 Maulas categorically concluded that Renilda’s version is “very far from the truth,” “very remote,” and, in fact, “impossible.”\n",
      "Indeed, the damages sustained by the two motorcycles, as well as the relative positions of the motorcycles, as observed by PO3 Maulas and inferred from said damages, constitute real evidence that ranks higher in the hierarchy of evidence compared to testimonial evidence.\n",
      "It is well-settled that object or physical evidence, when offered in accordance with the requisites for its admissibility, becomes evidence of the highest order and speaks more eloquently than witnesses put together. It has been characterized as “that mute but eloquent manifestations of truth which rate high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence,” such that “where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimonial evidence of the prosecution witnesses, x x x the physical evidence should prevail.” Thus, in People v. Vasquez, this Court refused to lend credence to the incriminating assertions of prosecution witnesses as to an alleged mauling, and stated that “[t]his Court cannot be persuaded by the prosecution’s claim of perpetration of physical violence in the absence of any marked physical injuries on the various parts of the victim’s face and body.”\n",
      "The same principle finds relevance here, considering that the physical evidence belies the prosecution’s testimonial evidence.\n",
      "Yet, neither the MTCC, the RTC, nor the CA attempted to remotely discuss why the findings of PO3 Maulas, and more importantly, the nature and locations of the damages sustained by the said motorcycles, did not at all warrant any consideration. In convicting Robles, the lower courts simply and solely relied on Renilda’s testimony, which they precipitously concluded to be credible, without any explanation as to why such version deserves more credence than the traffic investigator’s investigation report. On this score, the Court finds the lower courts to have been mistaken and, to a degree, remiss in the performance of their duties.\n",
      "Second, PO3 Maulas’ account has in its favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, which presumption the prosecution utterly failed to overturn.\n",
      "In Yap v. Lagtapon, the Court described the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties in this wise:\n",
      "The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties is an aid to the effective and unhampered administration of government functions. Without such benefit, every official action could be negated with minimal effort from litigants, irrespective of merit or sufficiency of evidence to support such challenge. To this end, our body of jurisprudence has been consistent in requiring nothing short of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary to overthrow such presumption. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "The presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty. Conversely, unless the official act in question is irregular on its face, or where the records suggest that the law enforcers involved deviated from the standard conduct of official duty as provided for in the law, the presumption prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Thus, unless the presumption is rebutted, it becomes conclusive.\n",
      "Here, the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to show any deficiency or irregularity on the part of PO3 Maulas in the performance of his official duty as the traffic investigator of the accident. Also, the prosecution did not show that he was impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely. As such, PO3 Maulas’ investigation report has in its favor the presumption that official duty had regularly been performed, and thus entitled to weight and respect.\n",
      " \n",
      "Notably, the prosecution simply harped on the fact that PO3 Maulas did not actually witness the accident. However, the Court has time and again given weight to the report of the traffic or investigating officer in cases involving vehicular accidents, even if the investigating officer did not actually witness the accident. In Serra v. Mumar, which involved a civil action for damages in relation to a charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, the Court upheld the traffic investigator’s report despite the investigator not having been an actual eyewitness, thus:\n",
      "Petitioner insists that the traffic investigator SPO3 Haran Abdullatip’s report should be disregarded because he was not at the scene when the accident happened.\n",
      "Rarely does it happen that the investigating officer personally witnesses an accident that he investigates, yet this does not mean that his observations are not valid. A traffic investigator’s training and experience allow him to determine how an accident occurred even without witnessing the accident himself.\n",
      "In this case, Abdullatip had been a traffic investigator for nine years. Even if he arrived at the scene after the accident, he saw the  vehicles in their relative positions as a result of the accident. His experience, as well as his evaluation of the statements from various witnesses, guided him in assessing who was at fault. In any case, the presumption of regularity in the exercise of functions is in his favor and therefore his report must be given credence. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n",
      "Similarly, in BJDC Construction v. Lanuzo, which involved a civil action for damages arising from a road accident, the Court upheld the contents of the police officer’s investigation report as it enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of the police officer’s duties. This presumption was upheld by the Court in this case, as no evidence was adduced to show any deficiency or irregularity in the performance of the police officer’s official duty as the police investigator of the accident, and that it was not shown that he was “impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, in Manuel v. Court of Appeals, which involved a civil action based on quasi-delict, therein petitioners questioned the accuracy of the sketches prepared by the police investigator, as “it was prepared the day after the incident and the alleged ‘tell-tale’ skid marks and other details had already been obliterated by the heavy downpour which lasted for at least an hour after the accident.” The Court, however, rejected this assertion, as the “strong presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty x x x erases, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, any suspicions that the police investigator just invented the skid marks indicated in his report.”\n",
      "Finally, in Caminos, Jr. v. People (Caminos), the Court even convicted therein accused of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property based on, among others, the entries in the traffic accident investigation report (TAIR) and sketch made by the traffic investigator depicting the post-collision positions of the two vehicles. In convicting therein accused, the Court noted that the “TAIR itself shows that petitioner approached the intersection in excess of lawful speed x x x which raises the presumption of imprudent driving x x x.”\n",
      "The foregoing principles find utmost relevance here, especially considering that the traffic investigator’s findings, rather than implicate, actually exonerate the accused.\n",
      "Certainly, in criminal cases, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot, by itself, overcome the superior presumption of innocence. Corollarily, if the official findings actually favor the accused, then such findings, if unrebutted, should inevitably yield the acquittal of the accused. After all, if the “facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his [or her] guilt, then the evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty and will not suffice to support a conviction.” Indeed, while the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot preponderate over the presumption of innocence, which prevails if not overthrown by proof beyond reasonable doubt, with much more reason should this presumption, if unrebutted, be considered “binding truth” in favor of the accused, especially considering that the accused is protected by the overwhelming presumption of innocence.\n",
      "Third, contrasting the two versions of the incident, the Court finds the version of Renilda incredible, contrary to the findings of the lower courts.\n",
      "Indeed, as correctly pointed out by PO3 Maulas, had Robles come speeding from Calceta Street and, in doing so, hit Ronelo’s  motorcycle which resulted in Ronelo and Renilda getting flung away, then the point of impact should not have been in front of St. Jude Hospital, which is located at the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street, but rather somewhere further at the middle of the said intersection. In addition, based on the prosecution’s version of the facts, had Robles’s Suzuki Raider motorcycle “hit and bump[ed]” Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle, there should likewise have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, and not on its left side where the change pedal is located.\n",
      "The relative positions of the two  vehicles at the point of impact and thereafter, as reflected in PO3 Maulas’ sketch below, likewise lead to the conclusion that Ronelo was the one who hit Robles and was, in fact, driving at a much faster speed.\n",
      "That Robles and his motorcycle were thrown further to the north (forward into CPG Avenue) would also indicate that Robles had indeed slowed down, while Ronelo, having gained much momentum, was thrown upon impact. Moreover, had Renilda’s version been true, then Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton should have been flung toward either CPG Avenue or further to the side of Benigno Aquino Avenue, instead of forward into CPG Avenue, as indicated in the sketch.\n",
      "Even more telling is the fact that the Information itself alleges that Robles was driving “along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue,” consistent with PO3 Maulas’ findings. If Robles really came from the east at Calceta Street and crossed through CPG Avenue at the intersection, as claimed by the prosecution, then why was this not alleged in the Information? Indeed, a defective Information which lacks certain essential allegations may still sustain a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial, and the deficiency was cured by competent evidence presented therein. However, that the Information itself contradicts the prosecution’s evidence, and supports the defense’s version of events, as here, further lends to the conclusion that the latter’s account is indeed more consistent with how the events actually transpired. To be sure, that the prosecution presented a version contrary to that stated in the Information undeniably puts in doubt the entire version of the prosecution as to what truthfully happened. As well, it lends credence to the version of the defense as testified to by Robles, PO3 Maulas, and the other defense witnesses.\n",
      "Accordingly, a thorough reading of the records of the case induces the Court to believe and approve the defense’s version of the incident. In checkered contrast, the Court finds the version of the prosecution doubtful and incongruous with reality.\n",
      " \n",
      "A causal connection between Robles’ negligence and the injuries or damages complained of was not proven beyond reasonable doubt\t \n",
      "Notwithstanding the obvious gaps in the prosecution’s evidence, the lower courts alternatively hinge Robles’ conviction on their finding that Robles was then driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver, for which reason, according to the lower courts, he would be presumed to be negligent under Article 2185 of the Civil Code.\n",
      "Again, the Court disagrees.\n",
      " \n",
      "Gonzaga v. People, and more recently, Ofracio v. People instruct that in order to establish a motorist’s liability for the negligent operation of a  vehicle, it must be shown that there was a direct causal connection between such negligence and the injuries or damages complained of. Otherwise stated, mere negligence, presumed or otherwise, does not warrant a conviction under Article 365 of the RPC, as a direct causal connection must additionally be shown between the accused’s negligence and the accident. In the same light, the Court, in Valencia v. People, further held that mere negligence will not suffice because it is the motorist’s willful and wanton act done in utter disregard of the consequence of his or her action, which criminalizes an imprudent or negligent act.\n",
      "Likewise, Añonuevo v. Court of Appeals clarifies that while the violation of a statute may establish some degree of negligence, pursuant to Article 2185 of the Civil Code, the complainant must nevertheless show that the violation of the statute was the proximate or legal cause of the injury, or that it substantially contributed thereto. After all, negligence consisting in whole or in part, of violation of law, like any other negligence, is without legal consequence unless it is a contributing cause of the injury.\n",
      "From the foregoing premises, it thus cannot be said that Robles could be presumed negligent, considering that there is no causal connection that could be reasonably drawn between his violations — lack of driver’s license and driving an unregistered vehicle — and the proximate cause of the accident. Additionally, there is also no evidence that the violations even contributed to the accident.\n",
      "In this connection, the Court notes that the lower courts failed to consider that Robles was, at the time of the mishap, actually accompanied by a back rider in the person of Lopos, a duly licensed driver. In fact, the RTC in the instant case even took judicial notice of the Decision rendered in Crim. Case No. 14906, wherein Robles was acquitted of the criminal offense of driving without a license because he was actually accompanied by Lopos, “a duly licensed driver.” Hence, that Robles only had a student driver’s permit could not at the onset give rise to a presumption that he was negligent, considering that the Traffic Code explicitly allows a student driver to operate a motor vehicle when accompanied by a duly licensed driver.\n",
      "The foregoing discussions point to no other conclusion than that Robles is not guilty of the crime charged and should consequently be acquitted.\n",
      " \n",
      "Robles’ conviction may not be sustained based on an alternative set of facts not supported by the prosecution’s evidence\n",
      "Finally, to support Robles’ conviction, the CA nonetheless holds that even if Robles’ version were to be believed, he nevertheless should have complied with Section 45(b) of the Traffic Code, which necessitated that he correctly positioned himself “nearest to the center line of the highway” prior to making a left turn, and that he be on the proper lookout for incoming  vehicles. “Had he done so,” the CA concludes, “he could have seen the fast speeding  motorcycle behind which x x x according to him, attempted to overtake him.” Thus, the CA finds Robles guilty of the crime charged as “had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened.”\n",
      "Again, the Court disagrees.\n",
      "Notably, the bulk of the CA’s assailed Decision was centered on justifying Robles’ conviction, if his claim “will be believed that he was also cruising along CPG Avenue when he was hit by the motorcycle driven by Solas on his left side.” It did not, at all, touch on why Robles should be convicted based on the facts as actually presented by the prosecution.\n",
      "On this score, the CA obviously overlooked that under the defense’s version of the incident: (1) both parties were approaching the intersection from the same direction, (2) thereafter, Robles signaled his intention to turn left, (3) Ronelo, meanwhile, was speeding in his attempt to overtake Robles, and (4) such attempt on the part of Ronelo to overtake caused the collision. Likewise on record is Dr. de los Santos’ testimony finding Ronelo to have been “intoxicated” at the time of this accident. Given these alternative set of facts, it cannot simply be concluded that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have occurred. These are just speculations. There are various other factors at play in a vehicular accident, as here, such as the relative distances and speeds of the two vehicles in their approach of the intersection — which, for obvious reasons, the prosecution, in this case, had not been able to address under the said “alternative” version of the facts.\n",
      "On this point, the Court’s ruling in Ladeco v. Angala, finds relevance. In that case, a pick-up truck running along the outer lane was slowing down to about five to 10 kilometers per hour (kph) and was making a left turn preparatory to turning south, or a U-turn, when it was bumped from behind by the crewcab which was running along the inner lane at around 60 to 70 kph. Interestingly, the owner of the crewcab alleged therein, as the CA holds in the present case, that the driver of the pick-up did not take the proper lane before executing the U-turn, in violation of Section 45(b) of Traffic Code and hence, it was the latter’s recklessness that was the proximate cause of the accident. The Court, disagreeing with the CA, held that the parties were both negligent, as while the pick-up truck was not in the correct lane, the accident would not have happened if the driver of the crewcab was not driving very fast. The Court went further to say that the crewcab, based on the doctrine of last clear chance, was ultimately at fault. Said the Court:\n",
      "Since both parties are at fault in this case, the doctrine of last clear chance applies.\n",
      "The doctrine of last clear chance states that where both parties are negligent but the negligent act of one is appreciably later than that of the other, or where it is impossible to determine whose fault or negligence caused the loss, the one who had the last clear opportunity to avoid the loss but failed to do so is chargeable with the loss. In this case, Deocampo had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. Since Deocampo was driving the rear  vehicle, he had full control of the situation since he was in a position to observe the vehicle in front of him. Deocampo had the responsibility of avoiding bumping the vehicle in front of him. A U-turn is done at a much slower speed to avoid skidding and overturning, compared to running straight ahead. Deocampo could have avoided the vehicle if he was not driving very fast while following the pick-up. Deocampo was not only driving fast, he also admitted that he did not step on the  brakes even upon seeing the pick-up. He only stepped on the brakes after the collision. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n",
      "Further, in Caminos, the Court likewise clarified that the right of way rule, as stated in Section 42 of the Traffic Code, is applicable in instances where two colliding vehicles are approaching the intersection at approximately the same time.\n",
      "In Caminos, the Court held that whether one of the drivers has the right of way or, as sometimes stated, has the status of a favored driver on the highway, is a question that permeates a situation where the vehicles approach the crossing so nearly at the same time and at such distances and speed that if either of them proceeds without regard to the other a collision is likely to occur. Nevertheless, the right of way accorded to vehicles approaching an intersection is by no means a legal straitjacket, and is subject to and is affected by the relative distances of the vehicles from the point of intersection, and their respective speeds. Notably, the Court here declared that “it is much unsafe as it is unjust to assume” that the one making a left turn had performed a risky maneuver at the intersection in simply “failing to keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles.“\n",
      "Likewise, in Adzuara v. Court of Appeals, a criminal case involving reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with less serious physical injuries, it was established that a motorist crossing a through stop street has the right of way over the one making a turn; but if the person making the turn has already negotiated half of the turn and is almost on the other side so that he or she is already visible to the person on the through street, the latter, having the last clear chance to avoid the accident, is bound to give way to the former.\n",
      "In sum, a motorist’s liability for a road accident is not determined simply by who among the parties had the right of way or was in the proper lane. Rather, the same is determined by various factors, which include, among others, the relative distances and respective speeds of the vehicles, or who among the parties had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.\n",
      "To stress, here, the prosecution, and later the lower courts, proceeded on the theory that Robles came from Calceta Street, and not CPG Avenue. As such, the prosecution did not, at all, present any evidence as to the speed and distance of Robles relative to Ronelo, had Robles come from CPG Avenue, and whether such directly caused, or at least materially contributed to, the injuries or damages complained of. Thus, the CA erred in justifying Robles’ conviction based simply on the alternative speculative theory that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened. This undoubtedly does not satisfy the core requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n",
      "To be sure, in a prosecution for reckless driving, the contributory negligence of the person who was injured or who was the driver of the motor  vehicle with which the accused’s vehicle collided does not constitute a complete defense. However, it is likewise true that a conviction must rest on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence, and not on the weakness — or in this case, the strength — of the defense.\n",
      "All told, the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the act and ultimately, the crime, for which he is being charged. The prosecution likewise neither established that Robles committed inexcusable lack of precaution in driving his  motorcycle, nor proved that his alleged negligence was the legal cause of the injury complained of.\n",
      "Based on the abovementioned premises, the Court is likewise unable to sustain the award of damages in favor of Renilda, Carmelino, and the heirs of Ronelo, considering that the prosecution failed to prove that Robles committed the act complained of. On this score, the Court also notes that Robles submitted before this Court affidavits of desistance respectively executed by Renilda and Carmelino, wherein both of them waived their respective claims for damages and indemnity against Robles.\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. CEB-CR No. 02067 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Michael John Robles is hereby ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove that he committed the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt.

      "On June 15, 2016, petitioner entered into a Contract of Employment with Wilhelmsen Manning on behalf of its principal, WSML, for petitioner to serve as an Ordinary Seaman on board the vessel M/V Toronto for a period of six months. Upon passing his medical examination and being declared as fit for sea duty, petitioner was deployed and commenced his duties on July 24, 2016.\n",
      "On December 26, 2016, while he was playing basketball with his work colleagues in their free time, petitioner suffered an injury in his left ankle. The Injury/Illness Report prepared by M/V Toronto’s ship master described his injury as a suspected torn Achilles tendon. A plaster cast was placed in his foot. Thereafter, on January 18, 2017, petitioner was medically repatriated to the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon his arrival, petitioner was referred to Wilhelmsen Manning’s company-designated physicians at Marine Medical Services. He underwent an initial evaluation on January 20, 2017. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on his left ankle, the result of which was described by the medical coordinator as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Left ankle MRI showed severely attenuated Achilles tendon approximately 7 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion, consistent with high-grade partial tear. Only a small amount of intact tendon fibers are present this level. The proximal and distal portions of the Achilles tendon demonstrate diffuse enlargement with extensive interstitial partial tears. Chronic complete tear of the anterior talofibular ligament. Mild poorly­defined bone marrow signal changes involving the distal fibula and lateral calcaneus probably representing mild bone contusions. Small tibiotalar joint effusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above findings were directly lifted from the medical impressions of the attending physician of the Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC) where the MRI was performed.\n",
      " \n",
      "Then, on February 6, 2017, petitioner underwent a surgery at the CSMC to repair his injured ankle. The Clinical Abstract shows that he was, ultimately, diagnosed with “High Grade Achilles Tendon Tear, Left.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Following his surgery, petitioner was referred by Wilhelmsen Manning to Bonzel Healthcare Rehab Clinic (BHRC) for physical therapy sessions. Between February 13, 2017 and June 23, 2017, petitioner visited BHRC 49 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alleging that respondents terminated his treatment on June 28, 2017 because his “work-related injury was too severe to be resolved within 120 days,” petitioner consulted an independent physician, Dr. Rogelio P. Catapang (Dr. Catapang) of Sta. Teresita General Hospital in Quezon City.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his Medical Report, Dr. Catapang declared petitioner unfit for sea duty. Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Arguilles still experiences pain of the left foot and ankle. The majority of patients regain full movements [sic] of a joint a few weeks after immobilization has been discontinued. Residual stiffness may be due either to intra-articular adhesions following a surgery involving the joint, or to extra-articular adhesions following traumatic edema with organization of the serofibrinous exudates into adhesions. Stiffness due to the repair of the Achilles tendon is due to adhesions due to the latter. The persistence of stiffness is sometimes an early symptom of traumatic arthritis. Recognizable interference with the articular cartilage is occasionally followed by arthritis, evident in MRI findings of mild bony contusions. This is seen chiefly in those patients who make constant demands at work (e.g. manual labor). The condition is then a sequel to raised pressure on the articular surfaces and continued stresses on the ligaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Arguilles‘ job demands heavy manual labor. He has weakness of the left lower extremity and cannot lift heavy objects because of the pain also felt at the left ankle joint. As an Ordinary Seaman may be called on to use emergency, lifesaving, damage control, and safety equipment; he must perform all operations connected with the launching of lifesaving equipment. He is also expected to be able to operate deck machinery, such as the windlass or winches while mooring or unmooring, and to operate cargo gear or other tasks directed by his superiors. These are activities which may require lifting heavy equipments [sic] or objects; climbing stairs or vertical ladders is with difficulty. Mr. Arguilles cannot perform these activities. There are restrictions placed on the patient’s activities to prevent further injuries from occurring; he is UNFIT for further sea duties.\n",

      "Petitioner asked respondents for payment of disability benefits, to no avail. Thus, he filed a complaint before the arbitration branch of the NLRC.\n",
      "\n",

      "In his Position Paper, petitioner argued, inter alia, that his injury was work-related, having sustained the same during the term of his contract; and that because respondents failed to arrive at a definitive assessment of his condition within 120 days from his repatriation, his disability should be classified as permanent and total and, accordingly, entitled to the corresponding benefits under the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n",
      "\n",
      "In their Position Paper, respondents countered, among others, that petitioner’s injury was not work-related because he suffered the same while playing basketball in his free time; and that contrary to petitioner’s assertion, respondents’ company-designated physician had actually declared him fit to work on June 28, 2017, and that such assessment holds greater weight than Dr. Catapang’s evaluation of petitioner’s condition.\n",

      "Whether the CA erred in affirming the NLRC’s order dismissing petitioner’s claim for disability benefits on the ground that his injury was not work-related and, hence, not compensable.\n",
      "Arguments\n",
      "\n",
      "In favor of petitioner\n",
      "Excoriating the ratiocination of the CA, petitioner asseverates in the instant petition that the nature of his work contributed to his injury; that while he was not on duty at the time that he sustained his injury during his leisure time, he was nevertheless on “on call” status and may be summoned by his superiors at any given time and regardless if he was sleeping, eating, or playing basketball; that because of their “on call” status, their working environment was controlled by their employer who allowed them to engage in activities like basketball during their off-duty hours; and that as such, the Bunkhouse Rule is squarely applicable to his case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner likewise contends that because respondents never issued a “fit to work” declaration or a definite assessment of his condition within the 120 and 240-day periods contemplated by law, his disability should already be considered as total and permanent.\n",

      "\n",
      "On April 30, 2018, LA Hernandez rendered a Decision in favor of petitioner.\n",

      "Accordingly, LA Hernandez decreed:\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,judgment is hereby rendered finding complainant Rosell Rodriguez Arguilles to be entitled to payment for his total and permanent disability benefits under the parties’ CBA of US$90,000.00, thus ORDERING respondents WILHELMSEN SMITH BELL MANNING, INC. and/or WILHELMSEN SHIP MANAGEMENT, LTD. and/or FAUSTO PREYSLER, JR., to pay complainant Arguilles such amount of US$90,000.00 in Philippine pesos at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment; in addition, to pay complainant moral and exemplary damages in the combined amount of P450,000.00; and finally to pay complainant 10% of the total monetary award as attorney’s fees.\n",

However, no copy of this document was attached to respondents’ Position Paper. Petitioner likewise disputed the existence of the said document in his Rejoinder. The absence of this document was also noted by LA Hernandez in his foregoing Decision.

      "In its Decision dated October 17, 2018, the NLRC maintained the finding of disability in favor of petitioner, albeit reducing the amount of disability compensation awarded by LA Hernandez.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NLRC ruled that under Article 13 of the CBA, petitioner is entitled to disability compensation because he sustained his injury in an accident which occurred while he was employed by respondents; and that under the Bunkhouse Rule, whether petitioner sustained his injury when he was off duty is immaterial, as long as the injury happened in the course of his employment. However, the NLRC ordered a reduction of the award of disability compensation due petitioner, explaining that his disability was neither permanent nor total.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NLRC also mentioned respondent’s claim that Dr. Bernal had already declared petitioner fit to work on June 28, 2017. Nevertheless, at that stage of the proceedings, the records did not contain any copy of Dr. Bernal’s Final Medical Report.\n",

The NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA provides for the provision of sleeping, cooking, and laundry equipment. More relevantly, it is required that recreational facilities be provided in accordance with International Labor Organization (ILO) Recommendation No. 138, series of 1970. Title IV of the said document reads as follows:\n",

      "IV. Recreation Facilities in Port and on Board Ship\n",

      "Centres providing meeting and recreation rooms for seafarers of all nationalities should be established or developed in all ports of interest to international shipping where there is a need for them.\n",
      "Healthy recreation such as hobbies, gymnastics, games or sports, both ashore and on board, as well as excursions to places of interest, should be encouraged and should be organised by and for seafarers with assistance as appropriate from the port welfare bodies. Where possible, facilities for swimming should be provided on board ship.\n",
      "All seafarers visiting a port should, where practicable and possible, have the opportunity of taking part in sports and outdoor recreation; for this purpose suitable facilities should be made available, for example by providing sports fields for the use of seafarers or by arranging for them access to existing sports fields.\n",
      "There should be co-operation among the competent authorities of different countries, shipowners’ and seafarers’ organisations, welfare organisations and ships’ captains in the establishment of international seafarers’ sports competitions such as lifeboat races, athletics and football matches. (Underscoring supplied)\n",
      "It is apparent that a seafarer’s participation in recreational activities such as sports and games is not an unsanctioned activity as respondents have characterized. Rather, they are part and parcel of a seafarer’s life while traversing the Seven Seas, should his or her vessel lead there. Accordingly, the fact that a seafarer suffered an injury while playing sports on board a vessel, during his or her free time, should not be curtly dismissed and brushed aside as one that it not related to that seafarer’s occupation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant and worthy of a brief discussion at this point are two jurisprudential precepts: the Bunkhouse Rule repeatedly espoused by petitioner, and the Personal Comfort Doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. A.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bunkhouse Rule was characterized by the Corpus Juris Secundum in the following manner:\n",
      "When the contract of employment contemplates that the employee shall sleep, or have his meals, or do both on the premises of the employer, the employee is considered to be performing services growing out of, and incidental to, or in the course of, such employment during the time he is on the premises of the employer for such purposes before or after the regular working hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admittedly, there is a scarcity of jurisprudential discussions in this jurisdiction with regard to the Bunkhouse Rule. The most recent evaluation of this precept can be traced back to the 1980 case of Uy v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, where the Court aptly defined the Bunkhouse Rule as one “where the employee is required to stay in the premises or in quarters furnished by the employer, injuries sustained therein are in the course of employment regardless of the time the same occurred.” Thus, the Court is constrained to take a glimpse at foreign jurisprudence to enhance Our understanding of this seldom-visited legal principle. Although foreign case law is merely persuasive authority and this Court is not bound by the same, they may nevertheless provide a useful framework in our own examination of the scope and application of the Bunkhouse Rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Larson v. Industrial Accident Commission, the Supreme Com1 of California declared that the test in determining the application of the Bunkhouse Rule is whether or not the employee is given a choice in the matter of where to live and is as free as possible to come or go as he or she pleases. The basic underpinning for this test, as explained by the Court of Appeals of Oregon in Leo Polehn Orchards v. Hernandez, is that it is the obligation of employment to be on the premises that creates the risk of injury to the employee; when the employee is free to leave when he or she pleases, that employment connection does not exist. And in Rodgers v. Kemper Construction Company, the Court of Appeals of California declared that:\n",
      "\n",
      "[W]here social or recreational pursuits on the employer’s premises after hours are endorsed by the express or implied permission of the employer and are “conceivably” of some benefit to the employer or, even in the absence of proof of benefit, if such activities have become “a customary incident of the employment relationship,” an employee engaged in such pursuits after hours is still acting within the scope of his employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, as summarized by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in O’Rourke v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board, the Bunkhouse Rule imposes workers’ compensation liability on an employer that requires its workers to live in employer-furnished premises, which the employer controls, maintains, and uses for its benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prescinding from the foregoing, one can discern that the basis of compensability under the Bunkhouse Rule is when employees are required by the nature of their work to stay within the premises of their respective employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Personal Comfort Doctrine, “the course of employment is not considered broken by certain acts relating to the personal comfort of the employee, as such acts are helpful to the employer in that they aid in efficient performance by the employee. On the other hand, acts which are found to be departures effecting a temporary abandonment of employment are not protected.”\n",
      "In the magniloquent, though antiquated, language of the Supreme Court of California in Whiting-Mead Commercial Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission:\n",
      "\n",
      "Such acts as are necessary to the life, comfort, and convenience of the servant while at work, though strictly personal to himself, and not acts of service, are incidental to the service, and injury sustained in the performance thereof is deemed to have arisen out of the employment. A man must breathe and occasionally drink water while at work. In these and other conceivable instances he ministers unto himself, but in a remote sense these acts contribute to the furtherance of his work…. That such acts will be done in the course of employment is necessarily contemplated, and they are inevitable incidents. Such dangers as attend them, therefore, are incidental dangers. At the same time injuries occasioned by them are accidents resulting from the employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verily, breaks which allow employees to administer to their personal comfort better enable them to perform their jobs and are therefore considered to be in furtherance of the employer’s business. Although technically the employees are performing no services for their employer in the sense that their actions do not contribute directly to the employer’s profits, compensation is justified on the rationale that the employer receives indirect benefits in the form of better work from happy and rested employees, and on the theory that such minor deviations do not take the employees out of their employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the Bunkhouse Rule, the Personal Comfort Doctrine has not yet been deeply inculcated in Our jurisprudence. Nevertheless, the Court has perambulated over this legal concept more recently in the case of Oscares v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the said case, John A. Oscares (Oscares) was a seafarer who was working on board the vessel MV K. Gamet which, at the time of the injury in question, was docked at a port in Panama. Oscares, while singing in front of a videoke machine together with another crew member, slipped and suffered serious knee injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying the Personal Comfort Doctrine to rule him entitled to disability benefits, the Court, speaking through Madame Justice Rosmari D. Carandang, enunciated in this wise:\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the Labor Code, the Workmen’s Compensation Act is the first law on workmen’s compensation in the Philippines for work-related injury, illness, or death. As such, We have also noted that the rule on compensation for work related-injuries of seafarers is analogous to the rule under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, that a preliminary link between the illness and the employment must first be shown before the presumption of work-relation can attach.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of Luzon Stevedoring Corporation v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, the Court held that “acts reasonably necessary to health and comfort of an employee while at work, such as satisfaction of his thirst, hunger, or other physical demands, or protecting himself from excessive cold, are incidental to the employment and injuries sustained in the performance of such acts are compensable as arising out of and in the course of employment.” Similar to Iloilo Dock & Engineering Co., Luzon Stevedoring Corporation also involves Act No. 3428. Even so, we find that its ruling applies here since Act No. 3428, like the POEA-SEC, also makes personal injury from any accident arising out of and in the course of the employment compensable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, Oscares’ act of singing can be considered necessary to his health and comfort while on board the vessel. He incurred his injury while he was performing this act. Oscares neither willfully injured himself nor acted with notorious negligence. Notorious negligence is defined as something more than mere or simple negligence or contributory negligence; it signifies a deliberate act of the employee to disregard his own personal safety. Jumping while singing cannot be considered as a reckless or deliberate act that is unmindful of one’s safety. There is nothing inherently dangerous about jumping while singing. Respondents themselves did not allege that Oscares intentionally injured himself or was negligent. The truth is that he simply lost his balance. Accordingly, Oscares’ injury is compensable. x x x\n",

      "I. C.\n",
      "While the Bunkhouse Rule and Personal Comfort Doctrine may find some application in this case, it must be stressed that the 2010 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA SEC), in conjunction with the NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA, already serves as the main basis for his claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 2, Rule IV of Department of Labor and Employment Order No. 130, series of 2013, provides that the terms and conditions of employment of seafarers shall be governed by the POEA SEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the definition of terms of the POEA SEC, a work-related injury is an “injury arising out of and in the course of employment.” Nowhere in this definition is it required that a seafarer must suffer an injury while he or she is actually performing his or her duties. Section 2(A) of the POEA SEC also provides that the employment contract of the seafarer shall be effective until his or her date of arrival at the point of hire upon termination of his or her employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatedly, under Section 1(A)(4) of the POEA SEC, an employer is duty-bound to “provide a seaworthy ship for the seafarer and take all reasonable precautions to prevent accident and injury to the crew including provision of safety equipment, fire prevention, safe and proper navigation of the ship and such other precautions necessary to avoid accident, injury or sickness to the seafarer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is beyond cavil that petitioner’s injury was sustained while his employment contract was still in effect and while he was still on board M/V Toronto. Accordingly, he suffered his injury in the course of his employment. This squarely falls within the POEA SEC’s definition of a work-related injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "In arriving at this conclusion, the Court makes it clear that not all injuries sustained by a seafarer on board a ship shall be compensable. After all, the employer was never intended to be an insurer against all accidental injuries which might happen to an employee while in the course of the employment, but only for such injuries arising from or growing out of the risks peculiar to the nature of work in the scope of the workmen’s employment or incidental to such employment, and accidents in which it is possible to trace the injury to some risk or hazard to which the employee is exposed in a special degree by reason of such employment. At this juncture, Section 20(D) of the POEA-SEC expressly provides:\n",

      "Section 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n",
      "\n",
      "x x x x\n",
      "\n",
      "D. No compensation and benefits shall be payable in respect of any injury, incapacity, disability or death of the seafarer resulting from his willful or criminal act or intentional breach of his duties, provided however, that the employer can prove that such injury, incapacity, disability or death is directly attributable to the seafarer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this provision, a seafarer is disqualified from receiving disability benefits if the employer proves the following: (1) that the injury, incapacity, or disability is directly attributable to the seafarer; (2) that the seafarer committed a crime or willful breach of duties; and (3) the causation between the injury, incapacity, or disability, and the crime or breach of duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it is undisputed that petitioner’s injury happened during the term of his employment, the burden rests upon respondents to prove by substantial evidence that such injury was directly attributable to his deliberate or willful act. Substantial evidence, to recall, has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might conceivably opine otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, petitioner was merely playing basketball, an employer-­sanctioned activity onboard the vessel. It cannot be considered as a reckless or deliberate activity that is unmindful of one’s safety. The records are bereft of any evidence, much less the slightest indication, that the injury suffered by petitioner was intentionally or negligently incurred. Thus, his injury is worthy of compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "II.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any event, petitioner’s entitlement to full disability benefits had already lapsed by operation of law.\n",
      "The determination of the fitness of a seafarer for sea duty is the province of the company-designated physician, subject to the periods prescribed by law. In Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr., the Court laid down the following guideposts that shall govern the claims for total and pe1manent disability benefits by a seafarer:\n",
      "\n",
      "The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer’s disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him or her;\n",
      "If the company-designated physician fails to give his or her assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer’s disability becomes permanent and total;\n",
      "If the company-designated physician fails to give his or her assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and\n",
      "If the company-designated physician still fails to give his or her assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer’s disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.\n",
      "Applying the foregoing standards to the case at bar, it may be recalled that petitioner was repatriated to the Philippines on January 18, 2017. He was then treated by respondents’ company-designated physicians at Marine Medical Services and, thereafter, BHRC. The 120-day and 240-day periods contemplated above lapsed without respondents ever issuing a final evaluation of petitioner’s condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court emphatically rejects as a mere scrap of paper the document ante-dated June 28, 2017 which respondents claim to be the final report declaring petitioner fit to work. As mentioned earlier, said document is merely a medical prescription that is not even denominated as a Final Medical Report as respondents erroneously claim. Worse, it was submitted belatedly before the NLRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that labor tribunals, such as the NLRC, are not precluded from receiving evidence submitted on appeal as technical rules are not binding in cases submitted before them. However, any delay in the submission of evidence should be adequately explained and should adequately prove the allegations sought to be proven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, there was no attempt on the part of respondents to explain the belated submission of evidence at the motion for reconsideration stage of the proceedings before the NLRC. On the contrary, respondents blatantly and falsely claimed that the same was already submitted to the LA and, thereafter, in their appeal with the NLRC. Unfortunately for respondents, the records do not lie. It was only when they sought a reconsideration of the NLRC’s October 17, 2018 Decision that this document saw the light of day. The Court cannot countenance respondents’ reprehensible behavior on this matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since no certification was issued by the company-designated physician within the 120/240-day period, petitioner’s condition had already lapsed into a total and permanent disability. He is, therefore, entitled to full disability benefits. In accordance with the provisions of the NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA, LA Hernandez correctly declared that petitioner is entitled to disability benefits amounting to US $90,000.00.\n",

      "Antecedents\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 15, 2016, petitioner entered into a Contract of Employment with Wilhelmsen Manning on behalf of its principal, WSML, for petitioner to serve as an Ordinary Seaman on board the vessel M/V Toronto for a period of six months. Upon passing his medical examination and being declared as fit for sea duty, petitioner was deployed and commenced his duties on July 24, 2016.\n",
      "On December 26, 2016, while he was playing basketball with his work colleagues in their free time, petitioner suffered an injury in his left ankle. The Injury/Illness Report prepared by M/V Toronto’s ship master described his injury as a suspected torn Achilles tendon. A plaster cast was placed in his foot. Thereafter, on January 18, 2017, petitioner was medically repatriated to the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon his arrival, petitioner was referred to Wilhelmsen Manning’s company-designated physicians at Marine Medical Services. He underwent an initial evaluation on January 20, 2017. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on his left ankle, the result of which was described by the medical coordinator as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Left ankle MRI showed severely attenuated Achilles tendon approximately 7 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion, consistent with high-grade partial tear. Only a small amount of intact tendon fibers are present this level. The proximal and distal portions of the Achilles tendon demonstrate diffuse enlargement with extensive interstitial partial tears. Chronic complete tear of the anterior talofibular ligament. Mild poorly­defined bone marrow signal changes involving the distal fibula and lateral calcaneus probably representing mild bone contusions. Small tibiotalar joint effusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above findings were directly lifted from the medical impressions of the attending physician of the Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC) where the MRI was performed.\n",
      " \n",
      "Then, on February 6, 2017, petitioner underwent a surgery at the CSMC to repair his injured ankle. The Clinical Abstract shows that he was, ultimately, diagnosed with “High Grade Achilles Tendon Tear, Left.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Following his surgery, petitioner was referred by Wilhelmsen Manning to Bonzel Healthcare Rehab Clinic (BHRC) for physical therapy sessions. Between February 13, 2017 and June 23, 2017, petitioner visited BHRC 49 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alleging that respondents terminated his treatment on June 28, 2017 because his “work-related injury was too severe to be resolved within 120 days,” petitioner consulted an independent physician, Dr. Rogelio P. Catapang (Dr. Catapang) of Sta. Teresita General Hospital in Quezon City.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his Medical Report, Dr. Catapang declared petitioner unfit for sea duty. Thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Arguilles still experiences pain of the left foot and ankle. The majority of patients regain full movements [sic] of a joint a few weeks after immobilization has been discontinued. Residual stiffness may be due either to intra-articular adhesions following a surgery involving the joint, or to extra-articular adhesions following traumatic edema with organization of the serofibrinous exudates into adhesions. Stiffness due to the repair of the Achilles tendon is due to adhesions due to the latter. The persistence of stiffness is sometimes an early symptom of traumatic arthritis. Recognizable interference with the articular cartilage is occasionally followed by arthritis, evident in MRI findings of mild bony contusions. This is seen chiefly in those patients who make constant demands at work (e.g. manual labor). The condition is then a sequel to raised pressure on the articular surfaces and continued stresses on the ligaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Arguilles‘ job demands heavy manual labor. He has weakness of the left lower extremity and cannot lift heavy objects because of the pain also felt at the left ankle joint. As an Ordinary Seaman may be called on to use emergency, lifesaving, damage control, and safety equipment; he must perform all operations connected with the launching of lifesaving equipment. He is also expected to be able to operate deck machinery, such as the windlass or winches while mooring or unmooring, and to operate cargo gear or other tasks directed by his superiors. These are activities which may require lifting heavy equipments [sic] or objects; climbing stairs or vertical ladders is with difficulty. Mr. Arguilles cannot perform these activities. There are restrictions placed on the patient’s activities to prevent further injuries from occurring; he is UNFIT for further sea duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner asked respondents for payment of disability benefits, to no avail. Thus, he filed a complaint before the arbitration branch of the NLRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In his Position Paper, petitioner argued, inter alia, that his injury was work-related, having sustained the same during the term of his contract; and that because respondents failed to arrive at a definitive assessment of his condition within 120 days from his repatriation, his disability should be classified as permanent and total and, accordingly, entitled to the corresponding benefits under the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n",
      "\n",
      "In their Position Paper, respondents countered, among others, that petitioner’s injury was not work-related because he suffered the same while playing basketball in his free time; and that contrary to petitioner’s assertion, respondents’ company-designated physician had actually declared him fit to work on June 28, 2017, and that such assessment holds greater weight than Dr. Catapang’s evaluation of petitioner’s condition.\n",

      "On April 30, 2018, LA Hernandez rendered a Decision in favor of petitioner.\n",

      "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED,judgment is hereby rendered finding complainant Rosell Rodriguez Arguilles to be entitled to payment for his total and permanent disability benefits under the parties’ CBA of US$90,000.00, thus ORDERING respondents WILHELMSEN SMITH BELL MANNING, INC. and/or WILHELMSEN SHIP MANAGEMENT, LTD. and/or FAUSTO PREYSLER, JR., to pay complainant Arguilles such amount of US$90,000.00 in Philippine pesos at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment; in addition, to pay complainant moral and exemplary damages in the combined amount of P450,000.00; and finally to pay complainant 10% of the total monetary award as attorney’s fees.\n",

However, no copy of this document was attached to respondents’ Position Paper. Petitioner likewise disputed the existence of the said document in his Rejoinder. The absence of this document was also noted by LA Hernandez in his foregoing Decision. Still, respondents continued to cite the same in their Notice of Appeal with Memorandum of Appeal without any evidentiary basis.\n",

      "In its Decision dated October 17, 2018, the NLRC maintained the finding of disability in favor of petitioner, albeit reducing the amount of disability compensation awarded by LA Hernandez.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NLRC ruled that under Article 13 of the CBA, petitioner is entitled to disability compensation because he sustained his injury in an accident which occurred while he was employed by respondents; and that under the Bunkhouse Rule, whether petitioner sustained his injury when he was off duty is immaterial, as long as the injury happened in the course of his employment. However, the NLRC ordered a reduction of the award of disability compensation due petitioner, explaining that his disability was neither permanent nor total.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NLRC also mentioned respondent’s claim that Dr. Bernal had already declared petitioner fit to work on June 28, 2017. Nevertheless, at that stage of the proceedings, the records did not contain any copy of Dr. Bernal’s Final Medical Report.\n",

      "In favor of petitioner\n",
      "Excoriating the ratiocination of the CA, petitioner asseverates in the instant petition that the nature of his work contributed to his injury; that while he was not on duty at the time that he sustained his injury during his leisure time, he was nevertheless on “on call” status and may be summoned by his superiors at any given time and regardless if he was sleeping, eating, or playing basketball; that because of their “on call” status, their working environment was controlled by their employer who allowed them to engage in activities like basketball during their off-duty hours; and that as such, the Bunkhouse Rule is squarely applicable to his case.\n",

      "Resolute in their position that the CA correctly ruled in their favor, respondents contend in their Comment that petitioner’s injury was not work­-related and, therefore, not compensable; that after undergoing treatment and rehabilitation, petitioner was declared “fit to work” by the company­-designated physician; and that, accordingly, petitioner’s monetary claims must be denied.\n",

      "The Ruling of the Court\n",
      "\n",
      "At the outset, petitioner raises questions of fact which are generally not allowed in a Rule 45 petition for review on certiorari. In this proceeding, only questions of law may be raised because the Court is not a trier of facts. Indeed, questions of fact are for the labor tribunals to resolve.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the rule admits of exceptions. If the findings of fact of the LA are in direct conflict with the NLRC, this Court may examine the records of the case and the questioned findings in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. Such is obtaining in this case. The conflicting findings of the LA, the NLRC, and the CA pave the way for this Court to review factual issues even if it is exercising its function of judicial review under Rule 45.\n",
      " \n",
      "Following a painstaking review of the records extant in this case, as well as the parties’ postures as amplified in their respective pleadings, the Court finds the petition impressed with merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seafarers’ employment is governed by the contracts they signed at the time of engagement. In this case, petitioner’s relationship with respondents is governed by the collective bargaining agreement between the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, on one hand, and the Association of Marine Officers’ and Seamen’s Union of the Philippines and the Norwegian Seafarers’ Union, on the other (NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA). Article 24 thereof states that the duration of said agreement was from January 1, 2016 until December 31, 2017, or well within the period of service rendered by petitioner.\n",
      "As a seafarer, petitioner obviously had to live on board M/V Toronto. Thus, the NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA included a provision with respect to how he is billeted in the said vessel, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 3\n",
      "Board and Lodging\n",
      "\n",
      "The seafarer is entitled to free board and lodging during service on board. If board and lodging is not provided on board, the Company shall defray the cost of satisfactory board and lodging ashore.\n",
      "The free board and lodging on board the vessel the vessel (sic) should include: \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "(a)\n",
      "sufficient food of good quality\n",
      "(b)\n",
      "accommodation of adequate size and standard\n",
      "(c)\n",
      "one mattress and at least one pillow, three blankets, two sheets, one pillow case (sic) and two towels. The sheets, pillow case (sic) and towels shall be changed at least once a week\n",
      "(d)\n",
      "necessary cutlery and crockery\n",
      "(e)\n",
      "laundry facilities\n",
      "(f)\n",
      "recreational facilities in accordance with ILO Recommendation No. 138 (1970). (Underscoring supplied)\n",
      "Prescinding from the foregoing, it is evident that having a bed to sleep on is not enough to satisfy the minimum board and lodging requirements for a seafarer in petitioner’s shoes. The NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA provides for the provision of sleeping, cooking, and laundry equipment. More relevantly, it is required that recreational facilities be provided in accordance with International Labor Organization (ILO) Recommendation No. 138, series of 1970. Title IV of the said document reads as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Recreation Facilities in Port and on Board Ship\n",
      "\n",
      "Centres providing meeting and recreation rooms for seafarers of all nationalities should be established or developed in all ports of interest to international shipping where there is a need for them.\n",
      "Healthy recreation such as hobbies, gymnastics, games or sports, both ashore and on board, as well as excursions to places of interest, should be encouraged and should be organised by and for seafarers with assistance as appropriate from the port welfare bodies. Where possible, facilities for swimming should be provided on board ship.\n",
      "All seafarers visiting a port should, where practicable and possible, have the opportunity of taking part in sports and outdoor recreation; for this purpose suitable facilities should be made available, for example by providing sports fields for the use of seafarers or by arranging for them access to existing sports fields.\n",
      "There should be co-operation among the competent authorities of different countries, shipowners’ and seafarers’ organisations, welfare organisations and ships’ captains in the establishment of international seafarers’ sports competitions such as lifeboat races, athletics and football matches. (Underscoring supplied)\n",
      "It is apparent that a seafarer’s participation in recreational activities such as sports and games is not an unsanctioned activity as respondents have characterized. Rather, they are part and parcel of a seafarer’s life while traversing the Seven Seas, should his or her vessel lead there. Accordingly, the fact that a seafarer suffered an injury while playing sports on board a vessel, during his or her free time, should not be curtly dismissed and brushed aside as one that it not related to that seafarer’s occupation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant and worthy of a brief discussion at this point are two jurisprudential precepts: the Bunkhouse Rule repeatedly espoused by petitioner, and the Personal Comfort Doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. A.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bunkhouse Rule was characterized by the Corpus Juris Secundum in the following manner:\n",
      "When the contract of employment contemplates that the employee shall sleep, or have his meals, or do both on the premises of the employer, the employee is considered to be performing services growing out of, and incidental to, or in the course of, such employment during the time he is on the premises of the employer for such purposes before or after the regular working hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admittedly, there is a scarcity of jurisprudential discussions in this jurisdiction with regard to the Bunkhouse Rule. The most recent evaluation of this precept can be traced back to the 1980 case of Uy v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, where the Court aptly defined the Bunkhouse Rule as one “where the employee is required to stay in the premises or in quarters furnished by the employer, injuries sustained therein are in the course of employment regardless of the time the same occurred.” Thus, the Court is constrained to take a glimpse at foreign jurisprudence to enhance Our understanding of this seldom-visited legal principle. Although foreign case law is merely persuasive authority and this Court is not bound by the same, they may nevertheless provide a useful framework in our own examination of the scope and application of the Bunkhouse Rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Larson v. Industrial Accident Commission, the Supreme Com1 of California declared that the test in determining the application of the Bunkhouse Rule is whether or not the employee is given a choice in the matter of where to live and is as free as possible to come or go as he or she pleases. The basic underpinning for this test, as explained by the Court of Appeals of Oregon in Leo Polehn Orchards v. Hernandez, is that it is the obligation of employment to be on the premises that creates the risk of injury to the employee; when the employee is free to leave when he or she pleases, that employment connection does not exist. And in Rodgers v. Kemper Construction Company, the Court of Appeals of California declared that:\n",
      "\n",
      "[W]here social or recreational pursuits on the employer’s premises after hours are endorsed by the express or implied permission of the employer and are “conceivably” of some benefit to the employer or, even in the absence of proof of benefit, if such activities have become “a customary incident of the employment relationship,” an employee engaged in such pursuits after hours is still acting within the scope of his employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, as summarized by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in O’Rourke v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board, the Bunkhouse Rule imposes workers’ compensation liability on an employer that requires its workers to live in employer-furnished premises, which the employer controls, maintains, and uses for its benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prescinding from the foregoing, one can discern that the basis of compensability under the Bunkhouse Rule is when employees are required by the nature of their work to stay within the premises of their respective employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Personal Comfort Doctrine, “the course of employment is not considered broken by certain acts relating to the personal comfort of the employee, as such acts are helpful to the employer in that they aid in efficient performance by the employee. On the other hand, acts which are found to be departures effecting a temporary abandonment of employment are not protected.”\n",
      "In the magniloquent, though antiquated, language of the Supreme Court of California in Whiting-Mead Commercial Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission:\n",
      "\n",
      "Such acts as are necessary to the life, comfort, and convenience of the servant while at work, though strictly personal to himself, and not acts of service, are incidental to the service, and injury sustained in the performance thereof is deemed to have arisen out of the employment. A man must breathe and occasionally drink water while at work. In these and other conceivable instances he ministers unto himself, but in a remote sense these acts contribute to the furtherance of his work…. That such acts will be done in the course of employment is necessarily contemplated, and they are inevitable incidents. Such dangers as attend them, therefore, are incidental dangers. At the same time injuries occasioned by them are accidents resulting from the employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verily, breaks which allow employees to administer to their personal comfort better enable them to perform their jobs and are therefore considered to be in furtherance of the employer’s business. Although technically the employees are performing no services for their employer in the sense that their actions do not contribute directly to the employer’s profits, compensation is justified on the rationale that the employer receives indirect benefits in the form of better work from happy and rested employees, and on the theory that such minor deviations do not take the employees out of their employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the Bunkhouse Rule, the Personal Comfort Doctrine has not yet been deeply inculcated in Our jurisprudence. Nevertheless, the Court has perambulated over this legal concept more recently in the case of Oscares v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the said case, John A. Oscares (Oscares) was a seafarer who was working on board the vessel MV K. Gamet which, at the time of the injury in question, was docked at a port in Panama. Oscares, while singing in front of a videoke machine together with another crew member, slipped and suffered serious knee injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying the Personal Comfort Doctrine to rule him entitled to disability benefits, the Court, speaking through Madame Justice Rosmari D. Carandang, enunciated in this wise:\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the Labor Code, the Workmen’s Compensation Act is the first law on workmen’s compensation in the Philippines for work-related injury, illness, or death. As such, We have also noted that the rule on compensation for work related-injuries of seafarers is analogous to the rule under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, that a preliminary link between the illness and the employment must first be shown before the presumption of work-relation can attach.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of Luzon Stevedoring Corporation v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, the Court held that “acts reasonably necessary to health and comfort of an employee while at work, such as satisfaction of his thirst, hunger, or other physical demands, or protecting himself from excessive cold, are incidental to the employment and injuries sustained in the performance of such acts are compensable as arising out of and in the course of employment.” Similar to Iloilo Dock & Engineering Co., Luzon Stevedoring Corporation also involves Act No. 3428. Even so, we find that its ruling applies here since Act No. 3428, like the POEA-SEC, also makes personal injury from any accident arising out of and in the course of the employment compensable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, Oscares’ act of singing can be considered necessary to his health and comfort while on board the vessel. He incurred his injury while he was performing this act. Oscares neither willfully injured himself nor acted with notorious negligence. Notorious negligence is defined as something more than mere or simple negligence or contributory negligence; it signifies a deliberate act of the employee to disregard his own personal safety. Jumping while singing cannot be considered as a reckless or deliberate act that is unmindful of one’s safety. There is nothing inherently dangerous about jumping while singing. Respondents themselves did not allege that Oscares intentionally injured himself or was negligent. The truth is that he simply lost his balance. Accordingly, Oscares’ injury is compensable. x x x\n",
      "\n",
      "I. C.\n",
      "While the Bunkhouse Rule and Personal Comfort Doctrine may find some application in this case, it must be stressed that the 2010 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA SEC), in conjunction with the NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA, already serves as the main basis for his claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 2, Rule IV of Department of Labor and Employment Order No. 130, series of 2013, provides that the terms and conditions of employment of seafarers shall be governed by the POEA SEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the definition of terms of the POEA SEC, a work-related injury is an “injury arising out of and in the course of employment.” Nowhere in this definition is it required that a seafarer must suffer an injury while he or she is actually performing his or her duties. Section 2(A) of the POEA SEC also provides that the employment contract of the seafarer shall be effective until his or her date of arrival at the point of hire upon termination of his or her employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatedly, under Section 1(A)(4) of the POEA SEC, an employer is duty-bound to “provide a seaworthy ship for the seafarer and take all reasonable precautions to prevent accident and injury to the crew including provision of safety equipment, fire prevention, safe and proper navigation of the ship and such other precautions necessary to avoid accident, injury or sickness to the seafarer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is beyond cavil that petitioner’s injury was sustained while his employment contract was still in effect and while he was still on board M/V Toronto. Accordingly, he suffered his injury in the course of his employment. This squarely falls within the POEA SEC’s definition of a work-related injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "In arriving at this conclusion, the Court makes it clear that not all injuries sustained by a seafarer on board a ship shall be compensable. After all, the employer was never intended to be an insurer against all accidental injuries which might happen to an employee while in the course of the employment, but only for such injuries arising from or growing out of the risks peculiar to the nature of work in the scope of the workmen’s employment or incidental to such employment, and accidents in which it is possible to trace the injury to some risk or hazard to which the employee is exposed in a special degree by reason of such employment. At this juncture, Section 20(D) of the POEA-SEC expressly provides:\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n",
      "\n",
      "x x x x\n",
      "\n",
      "D. No compensation and benefits shall be payable in respect of any injury, incapacity, disability or death of the seafarer resulting from his willful or criminal act or intentional breach of his duties, provided however, that the employer can prove that such injury, incapacity, disability or death is directly attributable to the seafarer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this provision, a seafarer is disqualified from receiving disability benefits if the employer proves the following: (1) that the injury, incapacity, or disability is directly attributable to the seafarer; (2) that the seafarer committed a crime or willful breach of duties; and (3) the causation between the injury, incapacity, or disability, and the crime or breach of duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it is undisputed that petitioner’s injury happened during the term of his employment, the burden rests upon respondents to prove by substantial evidence that such injury was directly attributable to his deliberate or willful act. Substantial evidence, to recall, has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might conceivably opine otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, petitioner was merely playing basketball, an employer-­sanctioned activity onboard the vessel. It cannot be considered as a reckless or deliberate activity that is unmindful of one’s safety. The records are bereft of any evidence, much less the slightest indication, that the injury suffered by petitioner was intentionally or negligently incurred. Thus, his injury is worthy of compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "II.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any event, petitioner’s entitlement to full disability benefits had already lapsed by operation of law.\n",
      "The determination of the fitness of a seafarer for sea duty is the province of the company-designated physician, subject to the periods prescribed by law. In Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr., the Court laid down the following guideposts that shall govern the claims for total and pe1manent disability benefits by a seafarer:\n",
      "\n",
      "The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer’s disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him or her;\n",
      "If the company-designated physician fails to give his or her assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer’s disability becomes permanent and total;\n",
      "If the company-designated physician fails to give his or her assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and\n",
      "If the company-designated physician still fails to give his or her assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer’s disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.\n",
      "Applying the foregoing standards to the case at bar, it may be recalled that petitioner was repatriated to the Philippines on January 18, 2017. He was then treated by respondents’ company-designated physicians at Marine Medical Services and, thereafter, BHRC. The 120-day and 240-day periods contemplated above lapsed without respondents ever issuing a final evaluation of petitioner’s condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court emphatically rejects as a mere scrap of paper the document ante-dated June 28, 2017 which respondents claim to be the final report declaring petitioner fit to work. As mentioned earlier, said document is merely a medical prescription that is not even denominated as a Final Medical Report as respondents erroneously claim. Worse, it was submitted belatedly before the NLRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that labor tribunals, such as the NLRC, are not precluded from receiving evidence submitted on appeal as technical rules are not binding in cases submitted before them. However, any delay in the submission of evidence should be adequately explained and should adequately prove the allegations sought to be proven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, there was no attempt on the part of respondents to explain the belated submission of evidence at the motion for reconsideration stage of the proceedings before the NLRC. On the contrary, respondents blatantly and falsely claimed that the same was already submitted to the LA and, thereafter, in their appeal with the NLRC. Unfortunately for respondents, the records do not lie. It was only when they sought a reconsideration of the NLRC’s October 17, 2018 Decision that this document saw the light of day. The Court cannot countenance respondents’ reprehensible behavior on this matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since no certification was issued by the company-designated physician within the 120/240-day period, petitioner’s condition had already lapsed into a total and permanent disability. He is, therefore, entitled to full disability benefits. In accordance with the provisions of the NSA-AMOSUP/NSU CBA, LA Hernandez correctly declared that petitioner is entitled to disability benefits amounting to US $90,000.00.\n",
