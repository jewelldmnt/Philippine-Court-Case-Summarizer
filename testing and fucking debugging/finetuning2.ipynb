      "In a memorandum dated 28 September 2004, issued by Engineer Alexander D. Paltao of the Technical Services COA Regional Office No. IV, and in an audit observation memorandum (AOM) dated 14 October 2004 issued by the Audit Team Leader of the municipality of Cabuyao, Laguna, Mayor Proceso Aguillo (Mayor Aguillo), municipal accountant Atty. Felix L. Galang, Jr. (Atty. Galang), municipal treasurer Elena A. Estalilla (Estalilla), municipal treasurer, building official Engineer Manolito Barundia (Barundia), and all the members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) were requested to submit certain documents to facilitate the COA’s investigation, viz.: the approved detailed plan, “approved” statement of work accomplished, copies of contracts and bidding documents. The requested documents pertain to anomalous projects entered into by the municipal government of Cabuyao, Laguna with Golden Deer Enterprises and RDC Construction Development Corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 26 February 2007, Notice of Suspension (NS) No. 2007-002-101 (2004) was issued, suspending in audit the aforesaid transactions of the municipal government in the total amount of P42,594,037.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 19 November 2007, COA Regional Cluster Director Eden T. Rafanan issued the subject ND, holding Mayor Aguillo, Atty. Galang, Estalilla, Barundia, liable for the disallowed amount. Members of the BAC, including petitioners Atty. Joaquin Delos Santos (Atty. Delos Santos), as the Chairman, Evelyn Hatulan (Hatulan), Cornelio Tamayo (Tamayo; collectively, petitioners), Pastor Canceran (Canceran) and Barundia, as members thereof, as well as Golden Deer Enterprises and RDC Construction were also held liable in the subject ND. Petitioners appeared to have received the ND on 08 January 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, COA Regional Director Luz Loreto-Tolentino (Director Loreto-Tolentino) issued a corresponding Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) and COA Order of Execution (COE) both dated 03 September 2012, holding petitioners, among others, liable for the disallowed amount. Petitioners immediately wrote a Letter dated 21 February 2013 to Director Loreto-Tolentino requesting for review of the disallowance, and that they be furnished copies of the documents material to the case. On 04 April 2013, COA Regional Director Nilda Blanco replied to the petitioners’ counsel declaring the NFD and COE to be final and executory, and that the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts and the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA are both silent on the power of the regional directors to review the NFD and COE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, on 17 September 2013, petitioners filed with the COA Proper an urgent motion for the issuance of order to set aside NFD and COE, and to release documents pertinent to ND No. 200-036-101 (04), and to admit appeal (Omnibus Motion). They claimed that they did not receive the subject ND.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Decision dated 13 April 2015, the COA denied petitioners’ Omnibus Motion and declared the subject ND to be final and executory. The COA ruled that petitioners received the subject ND based on their signatures appearing thereon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration claiming that the ND is defective because it failed to specify the projects and contracts disallowed, and only made references to the AOM and NS previously issued. Additionally, they claim that they are uncertain whether there was a BAC constituted during the term of Mayor Aguillo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COA En Banc denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that the subject ND had long become final and executory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence this Petition, where petitioners insist they were deprived of their right to due process because they were held liable for the subject ND which they did not receive. They also reiterate their objection to the failure of the ND to specify the projects and contracts it seeks to investigate. They assert that had they truly received the subject ND, they would have immediately reacted to it given the amount disallowed therein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioners allege that their signatures in the subject ND are fake and not their real signatures, and as proof thereof, they have attached documents supposedly containing their true signatures. They surmise that their names were being used to conceal the real perpetrators and maintain that Atty. Delos Santos cannot recall whether there was a duly composed BAC during the term of then Mayor Aguillo. According to petitioners, the municipal government of Cabuyao had no records of documents pertaining to the time pertinent to the case. Hence, they conclude that no such BAC was constituted and they were not members of any such committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, petitioners assert they should not be held liable because under the AOM and NS, which were the bases of the subject ND, it is the municipal accountant, Atty. Galang, who is required to submit documents pertaining to transactions entered into by the municipal government during Mayor Aguillo’s term.\n",
      " [SEP] COA’s Arguments\n",
      "COA maintains that petitioners are liable for the subject ND since it has long become final and executory. The COA argues that petitioners have been given various opportunities to comply with its directives when they received the AOM, NS and ND. Having failed to promptly question the adverse findings, petitioners are now barred from appealing the same through the instant Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue\n",
      "This Court is tasked to determine whether the COA committed grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the subject ND.\n",
      " [SEP] Before this Court is a Petition for Certiorari (Petition) assailing the Commission on Audit (COA) Decision No. 2015-223 dated 13 April 2015 and Notice dated 12 July 2016, which affirmed the Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2007-036-101 (04) (subject ND) dated 19 November 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling of the Court\n",
      "The Petition is meritorious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owing to its mandate as an independent constitutional commission, this Court’s review of decisions of the COA is generally limited to questions of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment. Questions of fact cannot be raised except to determine whether the COA is guilty of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. “A finding of grave abuse of discretion against the COA means that the audit commission is guilty of evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law and the evidence, but on caprice, whim and despotism. As the party alleging grave abuse of discretion, petitioners had the burden to prove that the COA had acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatedly, “it is also a well-entrenched rule that the right to appeal is a statutory right and one who seeks to avail of the right must strictly comply with the requirements set forth under the pertinent law or rules.” Indeed, the Court has been strict in enforcing statutory requirements of appeal to ensure that cases are promptly and orderly adjudicated. Pursuant thereto, this Court does not generally entertain petitions under Rule 64 which originated from the COA’s denial of a late appeal. Nevertheless, this Court, in certain cases, does not also hesitate to relax the aforesaid procedural rules on the basis of exceptional grounds, and in order to avoid commission of injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, in view of several grounds, this Court finds that petitioners should be allowed another opportunity to fully ventilate their defenses before the COA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioners failed to establish that their signatures were forged.\n",
      "“Forgery is the ‘counterfeiting’ of any writing, consisting in the signing of another’s name with intent to defraud. Since it is not presumed, forgery ‘must be proved with clear, positive and convincing evidence’ by the party alleging it.” There are various factors which may have the effect of varying the signature of a person, such as his position while signing, the condition of the surface on which the paper where the questioned signature is written is placed, his state of mind, feelings and nerves, and the kind of pen and/or paper used. The presence of any of these circumstances may cause changes in one’s signature and does not necessarily mean that his signature was forged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proving forgery entails a showing of the extent, kind and significance of the variation in the genuine and disputed signatures of the signee. It must be established that the difference in the signatures is due to the operation of a different personality and not merely an expected and inevitable variation found in the genuine writing of the same writer. It must be shown that the resemblance is a result of a more or less skillful imitation and not merely a habitual and characteristic resemblance which naturally appears in a genuine writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, after comparison of petitioners’ specimen signatures and those contained in the subject ND, this Court finds that petitioners failed to establish forgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Hatulan, this Court notes that her signature in the subject ND is the same as her specimen signature in her PDS dated 2 May 2001, the document which was closest in time to the subject ND. Further, even in later documents, particularly those in the attachments to the petition, Hatulan’s signatures are strikingly similar to that appearing in the subject ND. The same conclusion applies to Tamayo. His specimen signature in his Panunumpa sa Tungkulin dated 13 January 2005 does not appear to be substantially different from that in the subject ND.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Atty. Delos Santos, although his signature in the subject ND is different from his specimen signatures, this Court finds the same insufficient to prove forgery. He did not present supporting evidence to clearly show that the difference in the appearance of the signature was caused by another individual and not merely a variation of his own handwriting. “Mere variance of the signatures in different documents cannot be considered as conclusive proof that one is forged.” Although resort to experts is not mandatory in the examination of alleged forged documents, the opinions of handwriting experts would have been helpful in the court’s determination of a document’s authenticity. These handwriting experts can help determine fundamental, significant differences in writing characteristics between the questioned and the standard or sample specimen signatures, as well as the movement and manner of execution strokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, aside from the supposed differences in the signatures in the subject ND and their alleged specimen signatures, petitioners failed to elucidate the circumstances of the forgery, such as how and who may have been responsible for imitating all of their signatures. For the dearth of such clear and convincing evidence establishing forgery, this Court is constrained to take the document as what it appears to be—showing petitioners’ receipt thereof. Nevertheless, despite petitioners’ receipt of the subject ND, this Court finds that it did not sufficiently apprise them of the basis for the disallowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject ND is an insufficient notice of petitioners’ liability.\n",
      "The 1997 Rules of Procedure of the COA provide that the auditor’s findings must clearly state the basis for its findings, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "SECTION 4. Report, Certificate of Settlement and Balances, Notice of Disallowances and Charges, Order or Decision of the Auditor. — The result of the audit work of the Auditor may be in the form of a report, Certificate of Settlement and Balances, notice of disallowances and charges, audit observation, order or decision which shall clearly and distinctly state his findings of fact, conclusions, recommendations and dispositions. The factual findings shall be adequately established by evidence and the conclusions, recommendations or dispositions shall be supported by applicable laws, regulations, jurisprudence and the generally accepted accounting and auditing principles on which the report, Certificate of Settlement and Balances, notice of disallowances and charges and order or decision are based. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, jurisprudence is consistent in holding that the constitutional rule requiring a clear and distinct statement of factual and legal basis of a resolution/decision is an indispensable component of the litigant’s right to due process. Failure to state clear basis for its decision constitutes grave abuse of discretion.\n",

      "In Fontanilla v. Commissioner Proper, this Court found that the COA violated the tenets of due process when the Adjudication and Settlement Board of the COA National Office held the supervising officer liable with the erring employee for the stolen cash, without including him as respondent in the proceedings before the audit team leader and subsequently, the appeal before the COA Regional Office. This Court stressed that due process is, at its core, giving a person an opportunity to be heard. There is denial of due process if a person is held liable for a charge, and his liability is confirmed on appeal without having been notified of the accusation, and given the opportunity to explain his case or have the ruling reconsidered. The Court added that therein respondent’s subsequent submission of a motion for reconsideration did not cure the COA’s denial of due process. Thus, the Court set aside the COA’s Decision insofar as it found therein petitioner Fontanilla solidarily liable with his subordinate. However, it directed Fontanilla to file his memorandum containing his evidence, or to call for oral arguments that would allow him to present his evidence, so that the COA can validly rule on the issue of his liability for the stolen money.\n",

      "In Ablong v. Commission on Audit (Ablong), this Court ruled that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion, and ordered a remand of the case due to its non-observance of due process. This Court noted that the COA failed to give actual notice to the parties liable under the ND because it only gave copies thereof to the accountant who did not inform them of the disallowance of their Economic Relief Allowance. This Court likewise gave credence to therein petitioners’ allegation that even the supervising auditor refused their request to be furnished copies of the NDs. In failing to give petitioners copies of the ND, this Court found that the COA not only failed to follow its own rules, but also denied petitioners’ right to due process. A remand was therefore ordered to resolve petitioners’ appeal from the subject notices of disallowance on the merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, as in Ablong, the COA Proper cursorily denied petitioners’ request for documents on the ground of their receipt of the ND. Such reasoning is mistaken. Given the circumstances of this case, it is the service of the NS No. 2007-002-101(2004) dated 26 February 2007, or the earlier AOM No. 2004-009191 dated 14 October 2004, which would have given petitioners a real opportunity to prove the regularity of the municipality’s transactions. In other words, since petitioners were being held liable for their failure to submit documents, logic and due process require that there must be actual notice of the documents needed for the lifting of the suspension and reversal of the disallowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the instant case, the subject ND merely stated that the reason for its disallowance is because of “suspension maturing into disallowance.” It likewise failed to enumerate the documents subject of the NS and petitioners’ direct responsibility for such documents. Evidently, petitioners were left to speculate on the basis of suspension, or the specific documents necessary in order to explain the municipal government’s transactions with the aforesaid contractors. Moreover, the assailed Decision No. 2015-223 dated 13 April 2015 did not contain any supporting evidentiary or substantive basis for its denial of petitioners’ appeal. Thus, following the rulings in the above-cited case, this Court finds that remand is justified.\n",

      "Strictly applying the doctrine of finality and immutability of judgment, it would appear that this Court may no longer modify the subject ND.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, like most procedural rules, the doctrine of immutability of judgment has exceptions, namely: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable. Similarly, while it is doctrinally entrenched that certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal, the Court has allowed the resort to a petition for certiorari despite the existence of or prior availability of an appeal, such as: (1) where the appeal does not constitute a speedy and adequate remedy; (2) where the orders were also issued either in excess of or without jurisdiction; (3) for certain special considerations, as public welfare or public policy; (4) where in criminal actions, the court rejects rebuttal evidence for the prosecution as, in case of acquittal, there could be no remedy; (5) where the order is a patent nullity; and (6) where the decision in the certiorari case will avoid future litigations. In view of the most exceptional circumstances, courts may still review the COA’s decisions, particularly if the judgment would cause manifest injustice to the parties.\n",

      "In Philippine Health Insurance Corporation v. Commission on Audit, the Court considered as exceptional circumstance the enactment of a remedial legislation reclassifying PhilHealth personnel as public health workers in setting aside an already final decision of the COA. Meanwhile in Estalilla v. Commission on Audit (Estalilla), special considerations were given to the glaring disparity between the petitioner’s measly salary as municipal treasurer and the amount of P35,591,200.00 she was being required to return. This Court held that a finding of liability in that case would greatly and negatively impact the employee’s and her family’s life and livelihood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, in Bugna, Jr. v. Commission on Audit, after finding that petitioners were the same petitioners in Madera v. Commission on Audit, who were found to have acted in good faith when they performed their respective functions in relation to the prohibited allowances, this Court exempted the concerned local officials from personal liability on the disallowed amounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, aside from the defective notice of disallowance, this Court finds that there are special circumstances similar to Estalilla that should have precluded the COA from barring petitioners’ appeal and strictly applying the principle on immutability of judgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compelling and equitable circumstances justify a relaxation of the principle of immutability of judgment.\n",
      "In Estalilla, this Court excluded the municipal treasurer from liability under the notice of disallowance in the amount of P35,591,200.00 for a wrongful charging of an expense against a different budget allocation. Noting the disparity between the disallowed amount and her salary, the Court opined that holding Estalilla liable would lead to disastrous consequences to her and to her family. The same scenario applies in the instant case. The serious and dire consequences to petitioners’ lives and property should have prompted the COA to review the correctness of the allowance instead of stringently insisting that the disallowance has already become final and executory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, considering that the disallowance is not based on a supposed positive act of petitioners, but arose from their failure to submit documents, and given the enormous amount of disallowance, this Court finds that the COA should have been circumspect in upholding the subject ND. The circumstances of this case should have impelled it to, at least, grant petitioners, who are also colleagues of Elena Estalilla in the aforesaid case, access to relevant documents concerning the disallowance, such as, but not limited to, the AOM dated 14 October 2004, and NS No. 2007-002-101 (2004) dated 26 February 2007. We should point out, that COA’s denial of access to documents was also a pivotal issue in Estalilla that compelled the Court to rule that COA committed due process violations against the petitioner therein. We found no reason to have a different conclusion here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Court ruled in Estalilla:\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, Estalilla’s case affected her right to life and property. Judicial notice is taken of the size of her salary as a municipal treasurer in comparison with the disallowed amount of [Php]35,591,200.00. The huge disparity between her salary and the liability was glaring enough. To charge her with the solidary liability would produce very serious and dire consequences on her precious right to life and property. The consequences could impact negatively as well on the rest of her family. What makes the liability even harsher was that she had not personally derived any direct or personal benefit from the disallowed disbursements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the salaries of Hatulan and Tamayo are made of record and thus recognized by the Court. Indeed, to hold petitioners, especially Hatulan and Tamayo, solidarily liable for the larger amount of P42,594,037 given their measly salary would undoubtedly result to their financial ruin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COA should conduct an exhaustive investigation on the transactions covered by the subject ND.\n",
      "A notice of suspension is issued on transactions or accounts which could otherwise have been settled except for some requirements, like lack of supporting documents or certain signatures. It is also issued on transactions or accounts the legality/propriety of which the auditor doubts but which he may later allow after satisfactory or valid justification is submitted by the parties concerned. Under Section 82 of PD 1445, the suspension shall become a disallowance if the charge of suspension is “not satisfactorily explained within ninety days after receipt or notice by the accountable officer concerned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the COA held petitioners liable for their supposed failure to submit the following documents: (1) approved detailed plan; (2) approved detailed estimate; (3) approved statement of work accomplished; (4) copy of contract; and (5) bidding documents (invitation to bid, notice of award and notice to proceed). After this Court’s review of the pertinent rules on procurement, this Court finds that aside from re-investigating petitioners who were members of the BAC, the COA should also conduct a thorough examination on all the other parties to the procurement process, specifically the procuring entity and contractors identified in the subject ND.\n",

      "Among the factors to consider in determining the liability of public officers in returning disallowed amounts are said officers’ duties and responsibilities and the extent of their participation in the disallowed transaction. Thus:\n",

      "Section 351 of the Local Government Code provides that expenditures of funds or use of property in violation of law shall be the personal liability of the official or employee responsible therefor. In that regard, in Section 16 of Circular No. 2009-006, the COA has listed the factors to be considered in determining the liability of public officers for disallowances, namely: (1) the nature of the disallowance/charge; (2) the duties and responsibilities of officers/employees concerned; (3) the extent of their participation in the disallowed/charged transaction; and (4) the amount of damage suffered by or loss to the Government.

Felix L. Galang, Jr. (Atty. Galang), municipal treasurer Elena A. Estalilla (Estalilla), municipal treasurer, building official Engineer Manolito Barundia (Barundia), and all the members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) were requested to submit certain documents to facilitate the COA’s investigation, viz.: the approved detailed plan, “approved” statement of work accomplished, copies of contracts and bidding documents.

      "On 19 November 2007, COA Regional Cluster Director Eden T. Rafanan issued the subject ND, holding Mayor Aguillo, Atty. Galang, Estalilla, Barundia, liable for the disallowed amount.

Delos Santos), as the Chairman, Evelyn Hatulan (Hatulan), Cornelio Tamayo (Tamayo; collectively, petitioners), Pastor Canceran (Canceran) and Barundia, as members thereof, as well as Golden Deer Enterprises and RDC Construction were also held liable in the subject ND. Petitioners appeared to have received the ND on 08 January 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, COA Regional Director Luz Loreto-Tolentino (Director Loreto-Tolentino) issued a corresponding Notice of Finality of Decision (NFD) and COA Order of Execution (COE) both dated 03 September 2012, holding petitioners, among others, liable for the disallowed amount. Petitioners immediately wrote a Letter dated 21 February 2013 to Director Loreto-Tolentino requesting for review of the disallowance, and that they be furnished copies of the documents material to the case. On 04 April 2013, COA Regional Director Nilda Blanco replied to the petitioners’ counsel declaring the NFD and COE to be final and executory, and that the Rules and Regulations on Settlement of Accounts and the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA are both silent on the power of the regional directors to review the NFD and COE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, on 17 September 2013, petitioners filed with the COA Proper an urgent motion for the issuance of order to set aside NFD and COE, and to release documents pertinent to ND No. 200-036-101 (04), and to admit appeal (Omnibus Motion). They claimed that they did not receive the subject ND.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Decision dated 13 April 2015, the COA denied petitioners’ Omnibus Motion and declared the subject ND to be final and executory. The COA ruled that petitioners received the subject ND based on their signatures appearing thereon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration claiming that the ND is defective because it failed to specify the projects and contracts disallowed, and only made references to the AOM and NS previously issued. Additionally, they claim that they are uncertain whether there was a BAC constituted during the term of Mayor Aguillo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COA En Banc denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that the subject ND had long become final and executory.\n",

      "Hence this Petition, where petitioners insist they were deprived of their right to due process because they were held liable for the subject ND which they did not receive. They also reiterate their objection to the failure of the ND to specify the projects and contracts it seeks to investigate. They assert that had they truly received the subject ND, they would have immediately reacted to it given the amount disallowed therein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioners allege that their signatures in the subject ND are fake and not their real signatures, and as proof thereof, they have attached documents supposedly containing their true signatures. They surmise that their names were being used to conceal the real perpetrators and maintain that Atty. Delos Santos cannot recall whether there was a duly composed BAC during the term of then Mayor Aguillo. According to petitioners, the municipal government of Cabuyao had no records of documents pertaining to the time pertinent to the case. Hence, they conclude that no such BAC was constituted and they were not members of any such committee.\n",

      "Finally, petitioners assert they should not be held liable because under the AOM and NS, which were the bases of the subject ND, it is the municipal accountant, Atty. Galang, who is required to submit documents pertaining to transactions entered into by the municipal government during Mayor Aguillo’s term.\n",
      "\n",
      "COA’s Arguments\n",
      "COA maintains that petitioners are liable for the subject ND since it has long become final and executory. The COA argues that petitioners have been given various opportunities to comply with its directives when they received the AOM, NS and ND. Having failed to promptly question the adverse findings, petitioners are now barred from appealing the same through the instant Petition.\n",

      "Issue\n",
      "This Court is tasked to determine whether the COA committed grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed the subject ND.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling of the Court\n",
      "The Petition is meritorious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owing to its mandate as an independent constitutional commission, this Court’s review of decisions of the COA is generally limited to questions of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment. Questions of fact cannot be raised except to determine whether the COA is guilty of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. “A finding of grave abuse of discretion against the COA means that the audit commission is guilty of evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, such as when the assailed decision or resolution rendered is not based on law and the evidence, but on caprice, whim and despotism. As the party alleging grave abuse of discretion, petitioners had the burden to prove that the COA had acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatedly, “it is also a well-entrenched rule that the right to appeal is a statutory right and one who seeks to avail of the right must strictly comply with the requirements set forth under the pertinent law or rules.” Indeed, the Court has been strict in enforcing statutory requirements of appeal to ensure that cases are promptly and orderly adjudicated. Pursuant thereto, this Court does not generally entertain petitions under Rule 64 which originated from the COA’s denial of a late appeal. Nevertheless, this Court, in certain cases, does not also hesitate to relax the aforesaid procedural rules on the basis of exceptional grounds, and in order to avoid commission of injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, in view of several grounds, this Court finds that petitioners should be allowed another opportunity to fully ventilate their defenses before the COA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioners failed to establish that their signatures were forged.\n",
      "“Forgery is the ‘counterfeiting’ of any writing, consisting in the signing of another’s name with intent to defraud. Since it is not presumed, forgery ‘must be proved with clear, positive and convincing evidence’ by the party alleging it.” There are various factors which may have the effect of varying the signature of a person, such as his position while signing, the condition of the surface on which the paper where the questioned signature is written is placed, his state of mind, feelings and nerves, and the kind of pen and/or paper used. The presence of any of these circumstances may cause changes in one’s signature and does not necessarily mean that his signature was forged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proving forgery entails a showing of the extent, kind and significance of the variation in the genuine and disputed signatures of the signee. It must be established that the difference in the signatures is due to the operation of a different personality and not merely an expected and inevitable variation found in the genuine writing of the same writer. It must be shown that the resemblance is a result of a more or less skillful imitation and not merely a habitual and characteristic resemblance which naturally appears in a genuine writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, after comparison of petitioners’ specimen signatures and those contained in the subject ND, this Court finds that petitioners failed to establish forgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Hatulan, this Court notes that her signature in the subject ND is the same as her specimen signature in her PDS dated 2 May 2001, the document which was closest in time to the subject ND. Further, even in later documents, particularly those in the attachments to the petition, Hatulan’s signatures are strikingly similar to that appearing in the subject ND. The same conclusion applies to Tamayo. His specimen signature in his Panunumpa sa Tungkulin dated 13 January 2005 does not appear to be substantially different from that in the subject ND.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Atty. Delos Santos, although his signature in the subject ND is different from his specimen signatures, this Court finds the same insufficient to prove forgery. He did not present supporting evidence to clearly show that the difference in the appearance of the signature was caused by another individual and not merely a variation of his own handwriting. “Mere variance of the signatures in different documents cannot be considered as conclusive proof that one is forged.” Although resort to experts is not mandatory in the examination of alleged forged documents, the opinions of handwriting experts would have been helpful in the court’s determination of a document’s authenticity. These handwriting experts can help determine fundamental, significant differences in writing characteristics between the questioned and the standard or sample specimen signatures, as well as the movement and manner of execution strokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, aside from the supposed differences in the signatures in the subject ND and their alleged specimen signatures, petitioners failed to elucidate the circumstances of the forgery, such as how and who may have been responsible for imitating all of their signatures. For the dearth of such clear and convincing evidence establishing forgery, this Court is constrained to take the document as what it appears to be—showing petitioners’ receipt thereof. Nevertheless, despite petitioners’ receipt of the subject ND, this Court finds that it did not sufficiently apprise them of the basis for the disallowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject ND is an insufficient notice of petitioners’ liability.\n",
      "The 1997 Rules of Procedure of the COA provide that the auditor’s findings must clearly state the basis for its findings, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "SECTION 4. Report, Certificate of Settlement and Balances, Notice of Disallowances and Charges, Order or Decision of the Auditor. — The result of the audit work of the Auditor may be in the form of a report, Certificate of Settlement and Balances, notice of disallowances and charges, audit observation, order or decision which shall clearly and distinctly state his findings of fact, conclusions, recommendations and dispositions. The factual findings shall be adequately established by evidence and the conclusions, recommendations or dispositions shall be supported by applicable laws, regulations, jurisprudence and the generally accepted accounting and auditing principles on which the report, Certificate of Settlement and Balances, notice of disallowances and charges and order or decision are based. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, jurisprudence is consistent in holding that the constitutional rule requiring a clear and distinct statement of factual and legal basis of a resolution/decision is an indispensable component of the litigant’s right to due process. Failure to state clear basis for its decision constitutes grave abuse of discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In Fontanilla v. Commissioner Proper, this Court found that the COA violated the tenets of due process when the Adjudication and Settlement Board of the COA National Office held the supervising officer liable with the erring employee for the stolen cash, without including him as respondent in the proceedings before the audit team leader and subsequently, the appeal before the COA Regional Office. This Court stressed that due process is, at its core, giving a person an opportunity to be heard. There is denial of due process if a person is held liable for a charge, and his liability is confirmed on appeal without having been notified of the accusation, and given the opportunity to explain his case or have the ruling reconsidered. The Court added that therein respondent’s subsequent submission of a motion for reconsideration did not cure the COA’s denial of due process. Thus, the Court set aside the COA’s Decision insofar as it found therein petitioner Fontanilla solidarily liable with his subordinate. However, it directed Fontanilla to file his memorandum containing his evidence, or to call for oral arguments that would allow him to present his evidence, so that the COA can validly rule on the issue of his liability for the stolen money.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ablong v. Commission on Audit (Ablong), this Court ruled that the COA committed grave abuse of discretion, and ordered a remand of the case due to its non-observance of due process. This Court noted that the COA failed to give actual notice to the parties liable under the ND because it only gave copies thereof to the accountant who did not inform them of the disallowance of their Economic Relief Allowance. This Court likewise gave credence to therein petitioners’ allegation that even the supervising auditor refused their request to be furnished copies of the NDs. In failing to give petitioners copies of the ND, this Court found that the COA not only failed to follow its own rules, but also denied petitioners’ right to due process. A remand was therefore ordered to resolve petitioners’ appeal from the subject notices of disallowance on the merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, as in Ablong, the COA Proper cursorily denied petitioners’ request for documents on the ground of their receipt of the ND. Such reasoning is mistaken. Given the circumstances of this case, it is the service of the NS No. 2007-002-101(2004) dated 26 February 2007, or the earlier AOM No. 2004-009191 dated 14 October 2004, which would have given petitioners a real opportunity to prove the regularity of the municipality’s transactions. In other words, since petitioners were being held liable for their failure to submit documents, logic and due process require that there must be actual notice of the documents needed for the lifting of the suspension and reversal of the disallowance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the instant case, the subject ND merely stated that the reason for its disallowance is because of “suspension maturing into disallowance.” It likewise failed to enumerate the documents subject of the NS and petitioners’ direct responsibility for such documents. Evidently, petitioners were left to speculate on the basis of suspension, or the specific documents necessary in order to explain the municipal government’s transactions with the aforesaid contractors. Moreover, the assailed Decision No. 2015-223 dated 13 April 2015 did not contain any supporting evidentiary or substantive basis for its denial of petitioners’ appeal. Thus, following the rulings in the above-cited case, this Court finds that remand is justified.\n",

      "Strictly applying the doctrine of finality and immutability of judgment, it would appear that this Court may no longer modify the subject ND.

      "\n",

      "Nonetheless, like most procedural rules, the doctrine of immutability of judgment has exceptions, namely: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable. Similarly, while it is doctrinally entrenched that certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal, the Court has allowed the resort to a petition for certiorari despite the existence of or prior availability of an appeal, such as: (1) where the appeal does not constitute a speedy and adequate remedy; (2) where the orders were also issued either in excess of or without jurisdiction; (3) for certain special considerations, as public welfare or public policy; (4) where in criminal actions, the court rejects rebuttal evidence for the prosecution as, in case of acquittal, there could be no remedy; (5) where the order is a patent nullity; and (6) where the decision in the certiorari case will avoid future litigations. In view of the most exceptional circumstances, courts may still review the COA’s decisions, particularly if the judgment would cause manifest injustice to the parties.\n",

      "In Philippine Health Insurance Corporation v. Commission on Audit, the Court considered as exceptional circumstance the enactment of a remedial legislation reclassifying PhilHealth personnel as public health workers in setting aside an already final decision of the COA. Meanwhile in Estalilla v. Commission on Audit (Estalilla), special considerations were given to the glaring disparity between the petitioner’s measly salary as municipal treasurer and the amount of P35,591,200.00 she was being required to return. This Court held that a finding of liability in that case would greatly and negatively impact the employee’s and her family’s life and livelihood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, in Bugna, Jr. v. Commission on Audit, after finding that petitioners were the same petitioners in Madera v. Commission on Audit, who were found to have acted in good faith when they performed their respective functions in relation to the prohibited allowances, this Court exempted the concerned local officials from personal liability on the disallowed amounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, aside from the defective notice of disallowance, this Court finds that there are special circumstances similar to Estalilla that should have precluded the COA from barring petitioners’ appeal and strictly applying the principle on immutability of judgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compelling and equitable circumstances justify a relaxation of the principle of immutability of judgment.\n",
      "In Estalilla, this Court excluded the municipal treasurer from liability under the notice of disallowance in the amount of P35,591,200.00 for a wrongful charging of an expense against a different budget allocation. Noting the disparity between the disallowed amount and her salary, the Court opined that holding Estalilla liable would lead to disastrous consequences to her and to her family. The same scenario applies in the instant case. The serious and dire consequences to petitioners’ lives and property should have prompted the COA to review the correctness of the allowance instead of stringently insisting that the disallowance has already become final and executory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, considering that the disallowance is not based on a supposed positive act of petitioners, but arose from their failure to submit documents, and given the enormous amount of disallowance, this Court finds that the COA should have been circumspect in upholding the subject ND. The circumstances of this case should have impelled it to, at least, grant petitioners, who are also colleagues of Elena Estalilla in the aforesaid case, access to relevant documents concerning the disallowance, such as, but not limited to, the AOM dated 14 October 2004, and NS No. 2007-002-101 (2004) dated 26 February 2007. We should point out, that COA’s denial of access to documents was also a pivotal issue in Estalilla that compelled the Court to rule that COA committed due process violations against the petitioner therein. We found no reason to have a different conclusion here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Court ruled in Estalilla:\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, Estalilla’s case affected her right to life and property. Judicial notice is taken of the size of her salary as a municipal treasurer in comparison with the disallowed amount of [Php]35,591,200.00. The huge disparity between her salary and the liability was glaring enough. To charge her with the solidary liability would produce very serious and dire consequences on her precious right to life and property. The consequences could impact negatively as well on the rest of her family. What makes the liability even harsher was that she had not personally derived any direct or personal benefit from the disallowed disbursements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the salaries of Hatulan and Tamayo are made of record and thus recognized by the Court. Indeed, to hold petitioners, especially Hatulan and Tamayo, solidarily liable for the larger amount of P42,594,037 given their measly salary would undoubtedly result to their financial ruin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COA should conduct an exhaustive investigation on the transactions covered by the subject ND.\n",
      "A notice of suspension is issued on transactions or accounts which could otherwise have been settled except for some requirements, like lack of supporting documents or certain signatures. It is also issued on transactions or accounts the legality/propriety of which the auditor doubts but which he may later allow after satisfactory or valid justification is submitted by the parties concerned. Under Section 82 of PD 1445, the suspension shall become a disallowance if the charge of suspension is “not satisfactorily explained within ninety days after receipt or notice by the accountable officer concerned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the COA held petitioners liable for their supposed failure to submit the following documents: (1) approved detailed plan; (2) approved detailed estimate; (3) approved statement of work accomplished; (4) copy of contract; and (5) bidding documents (invitation to bid, notice of award and notice to proceed). After this Court’s review of the pertinent rules on procurement, this Court finds that aside from re-investigating petitioners who were members of the BAC, the COA should also conduct a thorough examination on all the other parties to the procurement process, specifically the procuring entity and contractors identified in the subject ND.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the factors to consider in determining the liability of public officers in returning disallowed amounts are said officers’ duties and responsibilities and the extent of their participation in the disallowed transaction. Thus:\n",

      "Section 351 of the Local Government Code provides that expenditures of funds or use of property in violation of law shall be the personal liability of the official or employee responsible therefor. In that regard, in Section 16 of Circular No. 2009-006, the COA has listed the factors to be considered in determining the liability of public officers for disallowances, namely: (1) the nature of the disallowance/charge; (2) the duties and responsibilities of officers/employees concerned; (3) the extent of their participation in the disallowed/charged transaction; and (4) the amount of damage suffered by or loss to the Government.

      "Petitioner and Marivic met through a common friend sometime in December 1986. Petitioner was a finance officer at the Philippine Embassy in Saudi Arabia, while Marivic worked as a staff nurse at a private hospital in Jeddah. Petitioner was so smitten by Marivic’s striking physical attributes that he courted her until they became sweethearts.\n",
      "Since her employment contract was to expire by the yearend of 1987, Marivic informed petitioner that she would be returning to the Philippines. Apprehensive that he may lose her, petitioner proposed marriage which Marivic accepted after several discussions and considerations. Thus, on December 10, 1987, the couple exchanged marital vows at the Office of the Philippine Consulate General in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. They again celebrated their marriage on March 12, 1988 at St. Pancratius Chapel, Paco Park, Manila. They were blessed with a child, Patrick Joshua, who was born on September 21, 1993.\n",
      "On November 14, 2006, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for the declaration of nullity of his marriage with Marivic and faulted her for being psychologically incapacitated to assume her marital obligations. He averred that during the initial period of their marriage, Marivic had been carefree, and was a consistent nagger and a very demanding wife, who preferred the company of friends instead of staying home to attend to the needs of her family. He also claimed that Marivic had no interest in looking for employment despite his prodding, and did not exert effort to provide for his basic needs. Also, without his knowledge, Marivic obtained loans, and one creditor of which she failed to pay filed a legal action against petitioner before the Department of Foreign Affairs, which placed his employment in jeopardy.\n",
      "Petitioner claimed that in order to avoid confrontation and to save their marriage, he would remain submissive to the will and caprices of Marivic. After realizing that she would no longer change, he finally decided to leave sometime in June 2005.\n",
      "Psychologist Nedy Tayag (Dr. Tayag) submitted and testified on the results of the psychological examination she conducted on petitioner, and concluded that he was suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) which resulted in his lack of concern for the overall welfare of his marriage. Dr. Tayag traced petitioner’s deficient personality condition from his early formative years. Dr. Tayag concluded that petitioner’s psychological incapacity is incurable, and that his marriage which was not founded on mutual trust, love, respect, and commitment, is beyond repair. Dr. Tayag also submitted her separate interviews on petitioner’s friends, namely, Fidelis Q. Apalisok (Apalisok) and Feliciano Pimentel (Pimentel), to supplement her report on petitioner’s psychological condition.\n",
      "In her Answer, Marivic denied being a carefree, consistent nagger, and demanding wife who is inconsiderate of the needs of her family. She argued that being the guilty spouse, petitioner cannot come to court to plea for annulment. She also claimed to have discovered petitioner’s psychological incapacity after their marriage, which was manifested by his irresponsible and abnormal attitude, as well as selfishness, especially on financial matters. Since petitioner did not provide for financial support, Marivic found work in his postings abroad. She also alleged that in June 1994, petitioner started spending most of his time outside their home with friends, and even engaged in adulterous relationships. She described petitioner to have become “obsessed with his own personal desires” that he had forgotten his obligation to sufficiently provide financial support, especially to Patrick Joshua.\n",
      " [SEP] Issues\n",
      "Petitioner maintains that the CA committed reversible error when it overturned the RTC’s decision and held that he failed to prove the presence of psychological incapacity. Petitioner insists that the RTC’s finding of psychological incapacity on his part is supported by both factual and clinical evidence. The findings of Dr. Tayag had sufficiently shown his NPD, and were even bolstered by Marivic’s allegations. He likewise points out that the RTC formed its conclusion on his narcissistic tendencies not only from his complaints against Marivic, but most importantly, from the findings of Dr. Tayag which discussed the root cause, gravity, incurability, and incapacitating nature of his narcissism.\n",
      "Furthermore, Marivic did not raise any new argument or fact in her appeal; hence, the findings of the RTC which were supported by preponderant evidence, should be accorded respect and must not be disturbed on appeal.\n",
      "Finally, petitioner argues that the Court, in Kalaw v. Fernandez, (Kalaw) has relaxed the rigid guidelines in deciding petitions filed under Art. 36 of the Family Code. He maintains that the facts in Kalaw and the instant case are identical, hence, the dissolution of his marriage is only proper and necessary.\n",
      "On her part, Marivic posits that the instant petition should be dismissed because the verification and certification of non-forum shopping were not signed by petitioner, and for raising question of facts. She also opines that petitioner failed to prove the root cause, gravity, and incurability of his purported psychological incapacity; that the findings on the root cause of the alleged psychological incapacity was couched in general and ambiguous language; that Dr. Tayag’s report failed to explain how petitioner’s psychological incapacity rendered him incapable of performing his marital obligations; that petitioner only seeks the annulment of their marriage because of an extramarital affair, and wanted to legitimize his relationship with his lover; that being the guilty party, petitioner should not be allowed to break free from the marriage by invoking his own misdeeds; and that the ruling in Kalaw did not abandon the guidelines set forth in Republic v. Molina (Molina).\n",
      "The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) argues in its Comment that the petition is dismissible for raising questions of fact. It also observed that the findings of Dr. Tayag on the root cause and gravity of petitioner’s alleged psychological incapacity were general and vague. The report failed to point out the actual and specific circumstances in petitioner’s upbringing that may have led him to crave for attention and recognition which resulted in his alleged disorder. The OSG also maintains that the report is unreliable because it was based on petitioner’s self-serving declarations.\n",
      "In his Compliance with Reply, petitioner denies that his petition contained a defective verification and certification of non-forum shopping. He contends that although Atty. Marvel C. Clavecilla (Atty. Clavecilla) had signed the said documents, he nonetheless executed a special power of attorney (SPA) authorizing Atty. Clavecilla to initiate the petition and sign all pleadings and motions on his behalf.\n",
      "Petitioner likewise counters that the present petition is exempt from the rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The significant variance between the findings of the RTC and the CA, as well as the erroneous inference and misapprehension of facts by the CA, constitute as exceptions to the rule. Petitioner maintains that Dr. Tayag’s report was supported by factual evidence; and that his narcissistic tendencies were consistent with Marivic’s description of his behavior during their marriage. He further insists that the RTC had fully discussed in its decision the debilitating nature, antecedent nature, incurability, gravity, and root cause of his NPD.\n",
      "Based on the parties’ opposing arguments, the Court will resolve the following: (1) may the psychologically incapacitated spouse initiate a petition for annulment of marriage under Art. 36 of the Family Code; (2) did the ruling in Kalaw abandon the guidelines laid down in Molina; and (3) should the marriage of petitioner and Marivic be annulled due to psychological incapacity on the part of petitioner?\n",
      " [SEP] Either spouse, whether psychologically incapacitated or not, may initiate a petition to declare the nullity of their marriage. The law only requires that the petition contains specific allegations of the incapacity of either or both spouses from complying with the essential marital obligations. The doctrine of unclean hands will not bar a psychologically incapacitated spouse from filing such petition.\n",
      "The Court resolves this Appeal by Certiorari filed by Fernando C. Clavecilla (petitioner) against the June 30, 2016 Decision and the October 7, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 101689, which reversed and set aside the April 10, 2013 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, Branch 20 (RTC). The CA held that petitioner failed to establish psychological incapacity either on his part or that of his wife, Marivic Clavecilla (Marivic), under Article 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "Ruling of the RTC\n",
      "On April 10, 2013, the RTC granted the petition based on its findings that petitioner was psychologically incapacitated. The RTC noted that even if petitioner was unsuccessful in pinning the blame on Marivic for their failed marriage, Dr. Tayag had sufficiently explained that petitioner’s psychological incapacity made it difficult for him to accept his failures and to acknowledge his shortcomings. The RTC believed that such personality disorder was characterized by juridical antecedence, having been deeply rooted and ingrained in his personality prior to his marriage. Hence, the RTC disposed:\n",
      "WHEREFORE, based from the totality of evidence presented in this case, on the ground of psychological incapacity of the petitioner, the petition is GRANTED.\n",
      "Accordingly, the marriage between petitioner FERNANDO CLAVECILLA and respondent MARIVIC CLAVECILLA is declared null and void under Art. 36 of the Family Code, as amended and all its effects under the law null and void from the beginning. Henceforth, their property relation is dissolved.\n",
      "As regards their son, Patrick Joshua Clavecilla y Villanueva, he is considered to be the legitimate child of the parties in accordance with Article 53 of the Family Code and shall retain the surname of his father and considering that the respondent is at present having custody over him, she shall retain custody over said child subject to the visitation rights of the petitioner.\n",
      "The settlement of the parties stated in this Order of this Court dated 15 June 2012, on the issue of support is hereby reinstated such that the Petitioner is directed to give monthly support to his son in the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (Php 25,000.00) starting 15 July 2012 and thereafter.\n",
      "Upon finality of this Decision, the Court shall forthwith issue the corresponding degree of nullity of marriage upon compliance with Section 21 of AM 02-11-10-SC on liquidation, partition, and distribution of the properties of the spouses.\n",
      "Pursuant to the provision of AM No. 02-11-10-SC, the Branch Clerk of Court shall enter this judgment upon its finality in the Book of Entry of Judgment and to issue an Entry of Judgment in accordance thereto. The Local Civil Registrar is also directed to cause the registration of the said Entry of Judgment in their respective Book of Marriages.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Marivic filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order issued on July 29, 2013. Aggrieved, Marivic filed her Notice of Appeal which the RTC gave due course on November 8, 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling of the CA\n",
      "In the now assailed decision, the CA reversed the RTC and held that the interview conducted by Dr. Tayag on petitioner and his friends, her testimony, and the documentary evidence submitted to the court, were insufficient to prove the root cause, gravity, and incurability of petitioner’s condition. It held that the juridical antecedence of the alleged incapacity was unclear; that Dr. Tayag’s findings were primarily based on the information provided by petitioner, which thereby casts doubt on the conclusiveness of her findings; and that there was no explanation on how petitioner’s narcissism made him psychologically incapacitated to perform his obligations as a husband. The CA likewise did not find merit in petitioner’s allegations of psychological incapacity on the part of Marivic. The CA concluded that:\n",
      "Irreconcilable differences, sexual infidelity or perversion, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, do not by themselves warrant a finding of psychological incapacity, as the same may only be due to a person’s difficulty, refusal or neglect to undertake the obligations of marriage that is not rooted in some psychological illness that Article 36 of the Family Code addresses.\n",
      "Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that “mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes and occasional emotional outburst cannot be accepted as indicative of psychological incapacity. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, the root cause should be a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.”\n",
      "WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated April 10, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, Branch 20 in Civil Case No. 2006-0117 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The marriage of Fernando C. Clavecilla and Marivic V. Clavecilla subsists and remains valid. SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but was denied by the CA in its October 7, 2016 Resolution.\n",
      "Hence, this petition.\n",
      "Our Ruling\n",
      "The appeal lacks merit.      \n",
      "\n",
      "The instant petition substantially complied with the rule on verification and certification on non-forum shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marivic makes issue of petitioner’s failure to personally execute the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to his petition. Petitioner, however, counters that through an SPA, he authorized Atty. Clavecilla to sign the verification and certification on his behalf.\n",
      "The Court agrees with petitioner.\n",
      "Altres v. Empleo (Altres) laid down the following guidelines governing noncompliance with the requirements or submission of defective verification and certification of non-forum shopping, viz.:\n",
      "1) A distinction must be made between [noncompliance] with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and [noncompliance] with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.\n",
      "2) As to verification, [noncompliance] therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.\n",
      "4) As to certification against forum shopping, [noncompliance] therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of “substantial compliance” or presence of “special circumstances or compelling reasons.”\n",
      "5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.\n",
      "6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf. (Emphases supplied)\n",
      "The above guidelines allow certain flexibility in the execution and submission of a verification and/or certification on non-forum shopping. For instance, in a verification, the courts may exercise discretion by ordering its submission or correction, or even act on the petition itself in order to serve the ends of justice. The courts may exercise this discretion because a verification is merely a formal, and not a jurisdictional, requisite, and noncompliance does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective.\n",
      "However, Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, being the applicable rule at the time that the instant petition was filed, requires the plaintiff or the principal party to execute the certification against forum shopping. If the principal cannot sign the certification, the one signing on his behalf must be authorized. Heirs of Gabriel v. Cebrero explained that there is substantial compliance with the requirement that the principal party should sign the certification when the attorney-in-fact is authorized under the SPA to file and prosecute suits on behalf of the former, thus:\n",
      "[W]hen an SPA was constituted precisely to authorize the agent to file and prosecute suits on behalf of the principal, then it is such agent who has actual and personal knowledge whether he or she has initiated similar actions or proceedings before various courts on the same issue on the principal’s behalf, thus, satisfying the requirements for a valid certification against forum shopping. The rationale behind the rule that it must be the “petitioner or principal party himself’ who should sign such certification does not apply. Thus, the rule on the certification against forum shopping has been properly complied with when it is the agent or attorney-in-fact who initiated the action on the principal’s behalf and who signed the certification against forum shopping.\n",
      "Also in Fyfe v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., the Court relaxed the rule on certification against forum shopping under Sec. 4, Rule 45, in relation to Sec. 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, when there was no showing that petitioners therein and their counsel intended to circumvent the requirements for verification and certification.\n",
      "Although another person may be authorized to initiate and file an action, and sign a pleading for and on behalf of the plaintiff or principal party, it bears emphasis that Altres still requires the latter to provide sufficient reason or justification for such authority. Such is the significance of this requirement that the Court may disregard the authority given by a sole proprietor to their counsel to sign on his or her behalf, if he or she cannot establish the inability to do physical acts such as the signing of documents.\n",
      "In here, Atty. Clavecilla appeared to be clothed with sufficient authority to file and sign the petition on petitioner’s behalf. The SPA that petitioner executed had expressly granted Atty. Clavecilla the authority “[t]o initiate the filing of a petition for review/appeal to the Supreme Court” and “[t]o sign any and all pleadings” in connection with the petition. Hence, Atty. Clavecilla is vested with sufficient authority to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping on behalf of petitioner.\n",
      "Apparently missing from the SPA, however, was the reason or justification for authorizing Atty. Clavecilla to sign on behalf of petitioner. The Court cannot simply presume that just because petitioner indicated therein his residence as “Torokvesz utca 36/D, 1025 Budapest, Hungary,” that he is incapable of returning to the country to sign the petition himself, more so when he also indicated in the same SPA, his residence in the Philippines (i.e. “I, FERNANDO C. CLAVECILLA, of legal age, Filipino, married, and resident of Torokvesz utca 36/D, 1025 Budapest, Hungary, and/or No. 32 Jacob Extension, Barangay Liboton, Naga City”). Altres clearly laid down the requirement that there should be sufficient justification for the parties’ inability to sign the certification personally.\n",
      "However, a perusal of the instant petition reveals that petitioner manifested his inability to physically sign the certification because he was assigned and detailed in Budapest, Hungary, as a finance officer of the Philippine Embassy. This circumstance sufficiently explains petitioner’s absence in the country and his inability to personally sign the petition. Hence, there can be no valid objection against petitioner’s failure to personally sign the verification and certification against forum shopping.      \n",
      "\n",
      "The instant petition is exempted from the rule that only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another procedural challenge posed by Marivic and the OSG, concerns the factual matters raised in the instant petition which, they argue, are improper in a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n",
      "The Rules of Court requires that only questions of law may be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45, since factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari. It is not the function of this Court to once again analyze or weigh evidence that has already been considered in the lower courts.\n",
      "However, the bar on factual issues admits of certain reasonable deviations, such as when the judgment is based on a misappreciation of facts or when the findings of fact of the CA are conflicting or contrary to those of the trial court.\n",
      "In view of the conflicting findings of the RTC and the CA, the rule prohibiting factual issues from being raised in a petition for review under Rule 45 shall be set aside to settle the controversies inherent in this case. As such, the procedural challenge against the inclusion of factual matters in the instant case fails.      \n",
      "\n",
      "Either spouse may petition the court to declare their marriage as null and void under Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marivic avers that petitioner came to court with unclean hands, having allegedly engaged in extramarital affairs and, thereafter, claimed to be psychologically incapacitated in order to break free from the marriage bond. As such, he should not be allowed to benefit from his own misdeed.\n",
      "The Court would like to clarify that although sexual infidelity is a ground for legal separation under Art. 55 of the Family Code, it may be deemed as a manifestation of psychological incapacity. Castillo v. Republic elucidated that there must be evidence linking the unfaithfulness with the inability to perform essential spousal obligations:\n",
      "In order for sexual infidelity to constitute as psychological incapacity, the respondent’s unfaithfulness must be established as a manifestation of a disordered personality, completely preventing the respondent from discharging the essential obligations of the marital state; there must be proof of a natal or supervening disabling factor that effectively incapacitated him from complying with the obligation to be faithful to his spouse. It is indispensable that the evidence must show a link, medical or the like, between the acts that manifest psychological incapacity and the psychological disorder itself.\n",
      "Accordingly, the allegation of marital infidelity cannot be automatically ruled as an invalid ground to declare a marriage void ab initio. As long as the alleged sexual infidelity stemmed from the psychological incapacity of the unfaithful spouse, then it can be a valid ground for declaration of nullity of marriage under Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "Another point that needs further elucidation, concerns Marivic’s reference to the principle of unclean hands as a bar against a purported psychologically incapacitated spouse to initiate a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage.\n",
      "The doctrine of unclean hands originated from the maxim “he who comes into equity must come there with clean hands.” It is a frequently stated maxim which is also expressed in the principle that he or she who has done inequity shall not have equity. It signifies that a litigant may be denied relief by a court of equity on the ground that his or her conduct has been inequitable, unfair and dishonest, or fraudulent, or deceitful as to the controversy in issue. Equity refuses to offer its aid in any manner to one seeking its active interposition who has been guilty of unlawful or inequitable conduct in the matter with relation to which he seeks relief. The early case of North Negros Sugar Co., Inc. v. Hidalgo explained the unclean hands doctrine as follows:\n",
      "Coming into Equity with Clean Hands. — The maxim that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands is, of course, applicable in suits to obtain relief by injunction. Injunction will be denied even though complainant shows that he has a right and would otherwise be entitled to the remedy in case it appears that he himself acted dishonestly, fraudulently or illegally in respect to the matter in which redress is sought, or where he has encouraged, invited or contributed to the injury sought to be enjoined. However, the general principle that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands applies only to plaintiff’s conduct in relation to the very matter in litigation. The want of equity that will bar a right to equitable relief for coming into court with unclean hands must be so directly connected with the matter in litigation that it has affected the equitable relations of the parties arising out of the transaction in question. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "The Court had the occasion to apply the unclean hands doctrine in the 1934 case of Villanueva v. Villanueva (Villanueva), which involved an action for support filed by the wife against her husband. When the case was decided in favor of the wife, the husband mortgaged some of his properties, left the country, and abandoned his family without any visible means of support. In executing the judgment, the sheriff seized and subsequently sold the properties, which the wife bought as partial payment for the judgment she had secured. The husband later sought to annul the sheriff sale, contending that the wife cannot enter into such transaction without his consent. In rejecting the claim, the Court applied the unclean hands doctrine and held that the husband should not be allowed to benefit from his act of depriving his family of support. The Court noted that after violating his marital obligations, the husband had the temerity to seek equitable relief through an annulment of deed of sale that was aimed at leaving his wife and children in absolute want.\n",
      "Notable, however, that except for the case of Villanueva, there has been no other occasion wherein the Court resolved a conflict between spouses by applying the unclean hands doctrine, especially one involving a petition to declare nullity of marriage under Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "At any rate, the Court does not see any reason why the principle of clean hands should prevent a psychologically incapacitated spouse from initiating a proceeding to annul a marriage. This is because there is no party at fault in case of annulment of marriage based on psychological incapacity. Culpability cannot be imputed on the part of the spouse said to be psychologically incapacitated since it is not deliberate or intentional on his or her part to possess such personality trait. By reason of psychological incapacity, it cannot be said that bad faith had motivated the afflicted spouse to enter into a marriage or to even seek for a declaration of its nullity. It must be emphasized that the unclean hands doctrine only avails in cases of inequity, which does not exist in a marriage sought to be annulled on the basis of psychological incapacity of a spouse to comprehend and discharge the concomitant marital obligations.\n",
      "Most importantly, Art. 36 of the Family Code does not prohibit the psychologically incapacitated spouse from initiating the action. Indeed, under the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, (the Rule) the Court allows either of the spouses to file the petition, alleging specifically, the facts showing the incapacity of either or both of them:\n",
      "Section 2. Petition for Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages. –\n",
      "(a) Who may file. – A petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage may be filed solely by the husband or the wife.\n",
      "(d) What to allege. – A petition under Article 36 of the Family Code shall specifically allege the complete facts showing that either or both parties were psychologically incapacitated from complying with the essential marital obligations of marriages at the time of the celebration of marriage even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its celebration.\n",
      "The complete facts should allege the physical manifestations, if any, as are indicative of psychological incapacity at the time of the celebration of the marriage but expert opinion need not be alleged. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "The recent case of Republic v. Claur reinforces Sec. 2(d) of the Rule that a petition for nullity of marriage may be filed by either spouses, whether incapacitated or not. In this case, both the wife and the husband were found to have been psychologically incapacitated. Verily, the courts do not limit the right to initiate a petition to nullify the marriage to the spouse who is not psychologically incapacitated.\n",
      "It therefore becomes of no moment whether the spouse should be free from psychological incapacity before he or she may be allowed to petition the courts for nullity of marriage. What is relevant is for the petition to contain specific allegations of the incapacity of either or both spouses from complying with the essential marital obligations at the time of the marriage.\n",
      "It likewise bears emphasizing that the minutes of the February 9, 1984 Joint Meeting of the Civil Code Revision and the IBP Family Law Committees provide proper perspective on the intention of the framers to allow either spouses, whether psychologically incapacitated or not, to initiate the petition. The relevant portions of the minutes read:\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments and Suggestions of Archbishop Oscar Cruz on the Proposed Provision on Judicial Declaration of Invalidity of Marriage\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Article 1.\n",
      "Either party may obtain a judicial declaration that a marriage is invalid whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that any of the following grounds existed at but was made manifest after the celebration of the marriage;\n",
      "1) That either party was wanting in the use of reason to appreciate the nature of marriage as permanent union between man and woman for the establishment of a family and the creation of reciprocal rights and duties essential to marriage;\n",
      "2) That either party acted under a mistake regarding the identity or capacity to marry of the other at the time of the celebration of the marriage;\n",
      "3) That either party was psychologically or mentally incapacitated to discharge the essential obligations of marriage as prescribed in the next succeeding article.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the opening phrase “Either party may”, Bishop Cruz inquired if the same would mean that the culpable cause of nullity can also file action for judicial declaration of invalidity of marriage. Justice Reyes explained that the said phrase was being proposed inasmuch as ordinary annulment of marriage is open only to innocent parties. Bishop Cruz remarked that if this is the intention, then there is no estoppel if one is the culpable cause.\n",
      "Director Romero stated that they also intend to keep the provisions on annulment of marriage.\n",
      "Clearly, the intent of the framers was to enable either party to file the petition for annulment on the ground of psychological incapacity unlike the other grounds for declaring a marriage void. Such was the intent of the framers of the Family Code that, even during the August 2 and August 9, 1986 meetings of the Civil Code Revision and the IBP Family Law Committees, there was no mention on whether the spouse who may initiate the action should be free from any psychological incapacity:\n",
      "Justice Puno observed that under the present draft provision, it is enough to show that at the time of the celebration of the marriage, one was psychologically incapacitated so that later on if already he can comply with the essential marital obligations, the marriage is still void ab initio. Justice Caguioa explained that since in divorce, the psychological incapacity may occur after the marriage, in void marriages, it has to be at the time of the celebration of the marriage. He, however, stressed that the idea in the provision is that at the time of the celebration of the marriage, one is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations, which incapacity continues and later becomes manifest.\n",
      "Justice Puno formulated the next article as follows:\n",
      "Article 37. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated, to comply with the essential obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void from the beginning even if such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization.\n",
      "Justice Caguioa suggested that “even if” be substituted with “although”. On the other hand, Prof. Bautista proposed that the clause “although such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization” be deleted since it may encourage one to create the manifestation of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa pointed out that, as in other provisions, they cannot argue on the basis of abuse.\n",
      "Evident from the abovequoted minutes that what is required in filing a petition for nullity of marriage is the presence of psychological incapacity. It will not be significant to the courts whether the petitioner spouse is free from such incapacity. The only requirement is that at least one of them is psychologically incapacitated to comprehend and discharge their marital obligations. If the intention of the framers was to prohibit the incapacitated spouse, they would have expressly stated so, similar to actions to annul a voidable marriage under Art. 47 of the Family Code.      \n",
      "\n",
      "Standards in determining psychological incapacity\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 36 of the Family Code, as amended, contemplates an inability to assume basic marital obligations. It does not simply relate to a mere difficulty, refusal, or neglect in performing marital obligations or ill will. Art. 36 reads:\n",
      "Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.\n",
      "The Court first defined the term “psychological incapacity” in Santos v. Court of Appeals as referring to a mental incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants. It is confined to the most serious cases of personality disorders resulting in an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage. In the same case, the Court made reference to the work of Dr. Gerardo Veloso, former Presiding Judge of the Metropolitan Tribunal of the Catholic Archdiocese of Manila (Branch I), when he described psychological incapacity as characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.\n",
      "Following these criteria, the Court promulgated Molina where it laid down the following guidelines in determining psychological incapacity:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) The root cause of the psychological incapacity must be (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by experts[,] and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological — not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties, or one of them, was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of ejusdem generis, nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at “the time of the celebration” of the marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or incurable. \n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Such illness must be grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "(8) The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal and the Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the state. No decision shall be handed down unless the Solicitor General issues a certification, which will be quoted in the decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement or opposition, as the case may be, to the petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Court later recognized in Ngo Te v. Yu-Te (Ngo Te) that the resiliency adopted by the framers of the Family Code had been rendered ineffectual by the strict standards in Molina. Hence, in declaring the marriage of the parties in Ngo Te as null and void, the Court emphasized that the courts should interpret psychological incapacity on a case-to-case basis instead of applying a priori assumptions, predilections or generalizations.\n",
      "In the subsequent case of Kalaw, to which petitioner attaches his cause, the Court viewed the Molina guidelines as having been too rigid to such point as to practically reject all petitions for declaration of nullity. The Court also emphasized that actual medical examination of the spouses need not be resorted to if the totality of evidence presented sufficiently sustains the finding of psychological incapacity.\n",
      "Most recently, the Court promulgated Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan­-Andal) which revisited the Molina guidelines. Tan-Andal abandoned the second Molina guideline of requiring expert evidence to prove psychological incapacity. The Court ruled that since psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder, the proof required should be that which will establish the durable or enduring aspects of the spouse’s personality structure. Such personality structure manifests as clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family by disabling the affected spouse to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations.\n",
      "Since psychological incapacity relates to the personality structure of spouses, Tan-Andal declared that the element of incurability required by Art. 36 of the Family Code be determined from a legal, not medical, point of view. It must be enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, which will inevitably result in the irreparable breakdown of the marriage. This personality aspect need not be proven by an expert, but may be established by ordinary witnesses who have consistently observed the behavior of the incapacitated spouse.\n",
      "Evidently, the prevailing standards in determining psychological incapacity were those laid down in Tan-Andal. Hence, the Court, in Cayabyab-Navarrosa v. Navarrosa, accordingly refined the requisites of juridical antecedence, incurability, and gravity in determining psychological incapacity as follows:\n",
      "In light of the Court’s fundamental paradigm shift in viewing psychological incapacity as a purely legal, rather than a medical concept, the understanding of the requisites in determining psychological incapacity, namely, juridical antecedence, incurability, and gravity, must be refined accordingly.\n",
      "With regard to the requisite of incurability, it must now be recognized that psychological incapacity is incurable only in the legal (not medical) sense in that the incapacity is “so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, and contemplates a situation where the couple’s respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage.” In order for the said requisite to obtain, there must be “[a]n undeniable pattern of a persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse that must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, the requisite of gravity in psychological incapacity must be such that it is caused by a genuinely psychic cause, and not just “mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes [or] occasional emotional outbursts” nor mere “refusal, neglect[,] difficulty, much less ill will.” As such, “a deeper and fuller assessment of the alleged incapacity must be done such that it is clearly and convincingly shown that the fulfillment of the essential marital obligations is not merely feigned or cumbersome but rather, practically impossible, because of the distinct psychological makeup of the person relative to his or her spouse.”\n",
      "Lastly, the requisite of juridical antecedence (which – to note – is explicitly necessitated by the phrase “at the time of the celebration of the marriage” in Article 36) means that the incapacity is determined to exist during the time of celebration. While it may indeed be difficult – if not scientifically impossible – to determine the existence of psychological incapacity at the exact point in time that the couple exchanged their ‘I dos,’ it is sufficient, however, that the petitioner demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the incapacity, in all reasonable likelihood, already exists at the time of the marriage’s celebration. To determine the reasonable likelihood of its existence at the time of the celebration of the marriage, the Court, in Tan-Andal, held that “proof of juridically antecedent psychological incapacity may consist of testimonies describing the environment where the supposedly incapacitated spouse lived that may have led to a particular behavior.”\n",
      "Moreover, the concept of juridical antecedence must be understood to include the ordinary experiences of the spouses not only prior to the marriage itself, but more importantly, during their “lived conjugal life” together since, as the law itself states, a marriage can be declared null and void under Article 36 “even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.” As the parties have yet to assume any of the essential marital obligations prior to being married, the Court discerns that the experience of marriage itself is the litmus test of self-realization, reflecting one’s true psychological makeup as to whether or not he or she was indeed capable of assuming the essential marital obligations to his or her spouse at the time the marriage was entered into.\n",
      "Therefore, in order to determine juridical antecedence, “judges must reconstruct the marital decision-making process of an individual, just like inquisitive investigators. The judge must trace back and examine all the manifestations before and during marriage to find out if such non-fulfillment relates to the intrinsic psychological makeup of the person relative to his or her specific partner, and not just some mere difficulty that ordinary spouses, at some point in time, are bound to go through.\n",
      "Overall, the focus should be on the manifestations during the marriage itself since, as intended by Canon Law from which psychological incapacity was patterned after, the lived conjugal life is that which provides a confirmation of the original consent or its absence at the time of the marriage’s celebration. Since there is no way to determine the existence of psychological incapacity at the exact point that vows were exchanged, it is enough that it exists at such time in all reasonable likelihood. This is determined, in turn, by the manifestations and circumstances attending before, and most significantly, during the marriage. (Underscoring supplied, emphases omitted)\n",
      "Finally, the Court, in Tan-Andal, declared that what the plaintiff-spouse in nullity cases under Art. 36 of the Family Code needs, is clear and convincing evidence. Such quantum of proof requires more than preponderant evidence but less than proof beyond reasonable doubt. Based on these guidelines, the Court will now determine whether petitioner was able to establish his claim of psychological incapacity. It must be emphasized that petitioner primarily insists that it is Marivic who is psychologically incapacitated, while the finding of Dr. Tayag that he was the one afflicted with incapacity, was his alternative argument. Hence, the following discussion will not only focus on whether there is clear and convincing evidence to establish petitioner’s psychological incapacity, but also whether he has sufficiently proven his claim that it was Marivic who failed to discharge and comprehend the essential marital obligations.      \n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner failed to present clear and convincing evidence of psychological incapacity either on his or on Marivic’s part.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recall, petitioner described Marivic as carefree, a consistent nagger, and a very demanding wife, who preferred the company of friends. However, his claims not only remained to be unsubstantiated, but were also insufficient to establish psychological incapacity. His complaints against Marivic appear to be minor, and do not have any relevance to her inability to perform essential marital obligations.\n",
      "Petitioner laments that Marivic appears to have no interest in contributing to the family’s income despite his prodding. Still, this allegation is not enough to convince the Court of her psychological incapacity.\n",
      "The standards in determining whether Marivic is psychologically incapacitated are laid down in Arts. 68 to 71 of the Family Code. Said provisions refer to spousal obligations which range from living together, observing mutual love, respect and fidelity, rendering mutual help and support, fixing the family domicile, support, and management of the household. Despite this myriad of spousal obligations, it was only in one aspect where Marivic, in the eyes of petitioner, failed in her duties, effectively admitting that she had no difficulty in performing the remaining obligations.\n",
      "Regardless, Marivic was able to sufficiently refute petitioner’s allegations of her supposed inability and unwillingness to contribute to the family’s income. The documents she presented (i.e. the certification from the International Operations Group of the Pag-IBIG Fund, Contract of Services with the Philippine Overseas Labor Office in Milan, Italy, etc.) reasonably prove that she was able to find work during their marriage, thus, enabling her to also provide for the financial needs of the family.\n",
      "Neither can petitioner rely on the interview conducted by Dr. Tayag on Apalisok and Pimentel, who related that Marivic did not exert any effort to find work. Their interviews did not provide any specific circumstances that could have established Marivic’s indifference to the needs of her family in relation to her duties as a wife.\n",
      "To reiterate, psychological incapacity does not simply connote difficulty, refusal, or neglect in performing marital obligations. It is pertinent to prove, based on the ruling in Tan-Andal, that the spouse is incapable of discharging those obligations by reason of a dysfunctional personality structure. Evidently, petitioner failed to establish his claim that Marivic was the psychologically incapacitated spouse.\n",
      "In a similar vein, the Court rejects petitioner’s alternative argument that he is psychologically incapacitated based on Dr. Tayag’s findings. He insists that Dr. Tayag’s report had established the root cause, gravity, incurability, and incapacitating nature of his NPD.\n",
      "The Court remains unpersuaded.\n",
      "The ruling in Tan-Andal is clear that there must be proof of the consistent behavior of the psychologically incapacitated spouse. This shall consist of an undeniable pattern of failing to be present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive. There was none in this case.\n",
      "Petitioner heavily relied on the report of Dr. Tayag, but there was nothing in her report which indicated a pattern indicating his inability to perform the essential spousal obligations. The said report merely provided a general description of petitioner’s family background without explaining how his relationship with his family, and even significant experiences during childhood, may have affected his personality structure. Being the youngest in the family with parents who want him to be strong and not pathetic, would not suffice to convince the Court that such aspirations from his parents would affect, later on, his interpersonal relationships and inability to comprehend and discharge spousal duties.\n",
      "To be clear, the Court does not doubt the diagnosis of Dr. Tayag – this is one aspect of the report that the Court will not tread on, as it is not an expert in the field of psychology or human behavior. However, her report lacked specific instances of petitioner’s behavior inconsistent with that of a husband who is always present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive towards Marivic.\n",
      "The interviews conducted on Apalisok and Pimentel likewise did not offer any glimpse into petitioner’s personality traits and behavior before and during his marriage with Marivic.\n",
      "More importantly, petitioner failed to impress upon the Court that his NPD impaired his ability to discharge the essential marital obligations under Arts. 68 to 71 of the Family Code. To reiterate, psychological incapacity should be viewed in the legal sense, and not in the medical sense. In sum, the totality of the evidence presented by petitioner failed to establish that his enduring personality structure rendered him incapable of comprehending and discharging his marital obligations in terms of juridical antecedence, gravity, and incurability in the legal sense.\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The June 30, 2016 Decision and the October 7, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 101689 are AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either spouse, whether psychologically incapacitated or not, may initiate a petition to declare the nullity of their marriage. The law only requires that the petition contains specific allegations of the incapacity of either or both spouses from complying with the essential marital obligations. The doctrine of unclean hands will not bar a psychologically incapacitated spouse from filing such petition.\n",
      "The Court resolves this Appeal by Certiorari filed by Fernando C. Clavecilla (petitioner) against the June 30, 2016 Decision and the October 7, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 101689, which reversed and set aside the April 10, 2013 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, Branch 20 (RTC). The CA held that petitioner failed to establish psychological incapacity either on his part or that of his wife, Marivic Clavecilla (Marivic), under Article 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antecedents\n",
      "Petitioner and Marivic met through a common friend sometime in December 1986. Petitioner was a finance officer at the Philippine Embassy in Saudi Arabia, while Marivic worked as a staff nurse at a private hospital in Jeddah. Petitioner was so smitten by Marivic’s striking physical attributes that he courted her until they became sweethearts.\n",
      "Since her employment contract was to expire by the yearend of 1987, Marivic informed petitioner that she would be returning to the Philippines. Apprehensive that he may lose her, petitioner proposed marriage which Marivic accepted after several discussions and considerations. Thus, on December 10, 1987, the couple exchanged marital vows at the Office of the Philippine Consulate General in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. They again celebrated their marriage on March 12, 1988 at St. Pancratius Chapel, Paco Park, Manila. They were blessed with a child, Patrick Joshua, who was born on September 21, 1993.\n",
      "On November 14, 2006, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for the declaration of nullity of his marriage with Marivic and faulted her for being psychologically incapacitated to assume her marital obligations. He averred that during the initial period of their marriage, Marivic had been carefree, and was a consistent nagger and a very demanding wife, who preferred the company of friends instead of staying home to attend to the needs of her family. He also claimed that Marivic had no interest in looking for employment despite his prodding, and did not exert effort to provide for his basic needs. Also, without his knowledge, Marivic obtained loans, and one creditor of which she failed to pay filed a legal action against petitioner before the Department of Foreign Affairs, which placed his employment in jeopardy.\n",
      "Petitioner claimed that in order to avoid confrontation and to save their marriage, he would remain submissive to the will and caprices of Marivic. After realizing that she would no longer change, he finally decided to leave sometime in June 2005.\n",
      "Psychologist Nedy Tayag (Dr. Tayag) submitted and testified on the results of the psychological examination she conducted on petitioner, and concluded that he was suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) which resulted in his lack of concern for the overall welfare of his marriage. Dr. Tayag traced petitioner’s deficient personality condition from his early formative years. Dr. Tayag concluded that petitioner’s psychological incapacity is incurable, and that his marriage which was not founded on mutual trust, love, respect, and commitment, is beyond repair. Dr. Tayag also submitted her separate interviews on petitioner’s friends, namely, Fidelis Q. Apalisok (Apalisok) and Feliciano Pimentel (Pimentel), to supplement her report on petitioner’s psychological condition.\n",
      "In her Answer, Marivic denied being a carefree, consistent nagger, and demanding wife who is inconsiderate of the needs of her family. She argued that being the guilty spouse, petitioner cannot come to court to plea for annulment. She also claimed to have discovered petitioner’s psychological incapacity after their marriage, which was manifested by his irresponsible and abnormal attitude, as well as selfishness, especially on financial matters. Since petitioner did not provide for financial support, Marivic found work in his postings abroad. She also alleged that in June 1994, petitioner started spending most of his time outside their home with friends, and even engaged in adulterous relationships. She described petitioner to have become “obsessed with his own personal desires” that he had forgotten his obligation to sufficiently provide financial support, especially to Patrick Joshua.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling of the RTC\n",
      "On April 10, 2013, the RTC granted the petition based on its findings that petitioner was psychologically incapacitated. The RTC noted that even if petitioner was unsuccessful in pinning the blame on Marivic for their failed marriage, Dr. Tayag had sufficiently explained that petitioner’s psychological incapacity made it difficult for him to accept his failures and to acknowledge his shortcomings. The RTC believed that such personality disorder was characterized by juridical antecedence, having been deeply rooted and ingrained in his personality prior to his marriage. Hence, the RTC disposed:\n",
      "WHEREFORE, based from the totality of evidence presented in this case, on the ground of psychological incapacity of the petitioner, the petition is GRANTED.\n",
      "Accordingly, the marriage between petitioner FERNANDO CLAVECILLA and respondent MARIVIC CLAVECILLA is declared null and void under Art. 36 of the Family Code, as amended and all its effects under the law null and void from the beginning. Henceforth, their property relation is dissolved.\n",
      "As regards their son, Patrick Joshua Clavecilla y Villanueva, he is considered to be the legitimate child of the parties in accordance with Article 53 of the Family Code and shall retain the surname of his father and considering that the respondent is at present having custody over him, she shall retain custody over said child subject to the visitation rights of the petitioner.\n",
      "The settlement of the parties stated in this Order of this Court dated 15 June 2012, on the issue of support is hereby reinstated such that the Petitioner is directed to give monthly support to his son in the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (Php 25,000.00) starting 15 July 2012 and thereafter.\n",
      "Upon finality of this Decision, the Court shall forthwith issue the corresponding degree of nullity of marriage upon compliance with Section 21 of AM 02-11-10-SC on liquidation, partition, and distribution of the properties of the spouses.\n",
      "Pursuant to the provision of AM No. 02-11-10-SC, the Branch Clerk of Court shall enter this judgment upon its finality in the Book of Entry of Judgment and to issue an Entry of Judgment in accordance thereto. The Local Civil Registrar is also directed to cause the registration of the said Entry of Judgment in their respective Book of Marriages.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Marivic filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order issued on July 29, 2013. Aggrieved, Marivic filed her Notice of Appeal which the RTC gave due course on November 8, 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruling of the CA\n",
      "In the now assailed decision, the CA reversed the RTC and held that the interview conducted by Dr. Tayag on petitioner and his friends, her testimony, and the documentary evidence submitted to the court, were insufficient to prove the root cause, gravity, and incurability of petitioner’s condition. It held that the juridical antecedence of the alleged incapacity was unclear; that Dr. Tayag’s findings were primarily based on the information provided by petitioner, which thereby casts doubt on the conclusiveness of her findings; and that there was no explanation on how petitioner’s narcissism made him psychologically incapacitated to perform his obligations as a husband. The CA likewise did not find merit in petitioner’s allegations of psychological incapacity on the part of Marivic. The CA concluded that:\n",
      "Irreconcilable differences, sexual infidelity or perversion, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, do not by themselves warrant a finding of psychological incapacity, as the same may only be due to a person’s difficulty, refusal or neglect to undertake the obligations of marriage that is not rooted in some psychological illness that Article 36 of the Family Code addresses.\n",
      "Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that “mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes and occasional emotional outburst cannot be accepted as indicative of psychological incapacity. The illness must be shown as downright incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will. In other words, the root cause should be a natal or supervening disabling factor in the person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying with the obligations essential to marriage.”\n",
      "WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated April 10, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, Branch 20 in Civil Case No. 2006-0117 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The marriage of Fernando C. Clavecilla and Marivic V. Clavecilla subsists and remains valid. SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but was denied by the CA in its October 7, 2016 Resolution.\n",
      "Hence, this petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issues\n",
      "Petitioner maintains that the CA committed reversible error when it overturned the RTC’s decision and held that he failed to prove the presence of psychological incapacity. Petitioner insists that the RTC’s finding of psychological incapacity on his part is supported by both factual and clinical evidence. The findings of Dr. Tayag had sufficiently shown his NPD, and were even bolstered by Marivic’s allegations. He likewise points out that the RTC formed its conclusion on his narcissistic tendencies not only from his complaints against Marivic, but most importantly, from the findings of Dr. Tayag which discussed the root cause, gravity, incurability, and incapacitating nature of his narcissism.\n",
      "Furthermore, Marivic did not raise any new argument or fact in her appeal; hence, the findings of the RTC which were supported by preponderant evidence, should be accorded respect and must not be disturbed on appeal.\n",
      "Finally, petitioner argues that the Court, in Kalaw v. Fernandez, (Kalaw) has relaxed the rigid guidelines in deciding petitions filed under Art. 36 of the Family Code. He maintains that the facts in Kalaw and the instant case are identical, hence, the dissolution of his marriage is only proper and necessary.\n",
      "On her part, Marivic posits that the instant petition should be dismissed because the verification and certification of non-forum shopping were not signed by petitioner, and for raising question of facts. She also opines that petitioner failed to prove the root cause, gravity, and incurability of his purported psychological incapacity; that the findings on the root cause of the alleged psychological incapacity was couched in general and ambiguous language; that Dr. Tayag’s report failed to explain how petitioner’s psychological incapacity rendered him incapable of performing his marital obligations; that petitioner only seeks the annulment of their marriage because of an extramarital affair, and wanted to legitimize his relationship with his lover; that being the guilty party, petitioner should not be allowed to break free from the marriage by invoking his own misdeeds; and that the ruling in Kalaw did not abandon the guidelines set forth in Republic v. Molina (Molina).\n",
      "The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) argues in its Comment that the petition is dismissible for raising questions of fact. It also observed that the findings of Dr. Tayag on the root cause and gravity of petitioner’s alleged psychological incapacity were general and vague. The report failed to point out the actual and specific circumstances in petitioner’s upbringing that may have led him to crave for attention and recognition which resulted in his alleged disorder. The OSG also maintains that the report is unreliable because it was based on petitioner’s self-serving declarations.\n",
      "In his Compliance with Reply, petitioner denies that his petition contained a defective verification and certification of non-forum shopping. He contends that although Atty. Marvel C. Clavecilla (Atty. Clavecilla) had signed the said documents, he nonetheless executed a special power of attorney (SPA) authorizing Atty. Clavecilla to initiate the petition and sign all pleadings and motions on his behalf.\n",
      "Petitioner likewise counters that the present petition is exempt from the rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The significant variance between the findings of the RTC and the CA, as well as the erroneous inference and misapprehension of facts by the CA, constitute as exceptions to the rule. Petitioner maintains that Dr. Tayag’s report was supported by factual evidence; and that his narcissistic tendencies were consistent with Marivic’s description of his behavior during their marriage. He further insists that the RTC had fully discussed in its decision the debilitating nature, antecedent nature, incurability, gravity, and root cause of his NPD.\n",
      "Based on the parties’ opposing arguments, the Court will resolve the following: (1) may the psychologically incapacitated spouse initiate a petition for annulment of marriage under Art. 36 of the Family Code; (2) did the ruling in Kalaw abandon the guidelines laid down in Molina; and (3) should the marriage of petitioner and Marivic be annulled due to psychological incapacity on the part of petitioner?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Ruling\n",
      "The appeal lacks merit.      \n",
      "\n",
      "The instant petition substantially complied with the rule on verification and certification on non-forum shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marivic makes issue of petitioner’s failure to personally execute the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to his petition. Petitioner, however, counters that through an SPA, he authorized Atty. Clavecilla to sign the verification and certification on his behalf.\n",
      "The Court agrees with petitioner.\n",
      "Altres v. Empleo (Altres) laid down the following guidelines governing noncompliance with the requirements or submission of defective verification and certification of non-forum shopping, viz.:\n",
      "1) A distinction must be made between [noncompliance] with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and [noncompliance] with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.\n",
      "2) As to verification, [noncompliance] therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.\n",
      "4) As to certification against forum shopping, [noncompliance] therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of “substantial compliance” or presence of “special circumstances or compelling reasons.”\n",
      "5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.\n",
      "6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf. (Emphases supplied)\n",
      "The above guidelines allow certain flexibility in the execution and submission of a verification and/or certification on non-forum shopping. For instance, in a verification, the courts may exercise discretion by ordering its submission or correction, or even act on the petition itself in order to serve the ends of justice. The courts may exercise this discretion because a verification is merely a formal, and not a jurisdictional, requisite, and noncompliance does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective.\n",
      "However, Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, being the applicable rule at the time that the instant petition was filed, requires the plaintiff or the principal party to execute the certification against forum shopping. If the principal cannot sign the certification, the one signing on his behalf must be authorized. Heirs of Gabriel v. Cebrero explained that there is substantial compliance with the requirement that the principal party should sign the certification when the attorney-in-fact is authorized under the SPA to file and prosecute suits on behalf of the former, thus:\n",
      "[W]hen an SPA was constituted precisely to authorize the agent to file and prosecute suits on behalf of the principal, then it is such agent who has actual and personal knowledge whether he or she has initiated similar actions or proceedings before various courts on the same issue on the principal’s behalf, thus, satisfying the requirements for a valid certification against forum shopping. The rationale behind the rule that it must be the “petitioner or principal party himself’ who should sign such certification does not apply. Thus, the rule on the certification against forum shopping has been properly complied with when it is the agent or attorney-in-fact who initiated the action on the principal’s behalf and who signed the certification against forum shopping.\n",
      "Also in Fyfe v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., the Court relaxed the rule on certification against forum shopping under Sec. 4, Rule 45, in relation to Sec. 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, when there was no showing that petitioners therein and their counsel intended to circumvent the requirements for verification and certification.\n",
      "Although another person may be authorized to initiate and file an action, and sign a pleading for and on behalf of the plaintiff or principal party, it bears emphasis that Altres still requires the latter to provide sufficient reason or justification for such authority. Such is the significance of this requirement that the Court may disregard the authority given by a sole proprietor to their counsel to sign on his or her behalf, if he or she cannot establish the inability to do physical acts such as the signing of documents.\n",
      "In here, Atty. Clavecilla appeared to be clothed with sufficient authority to file and sign the petition on petitioner’s behalf. The SPA that petitioner executed had expressly granted Atty. Clavecilla the authority “[t]o initiate the filing of a petition for review/appeal to the Supreme Court” and “[t]o sign any and all pleadings” in connection with the petition. Hence, Atty. Clavecilla is vested with sufficient authority to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping on behalf of petitioner.\n",
      "Apparently missing from the SPA, however, was the reason or justification for authorizing Atty. Clavecilla to sign on behalf of petitioner. The Court cannot simply presume that just because petitioner indicated therein his residence as “Torokvesz utca 36/D, 1025 Budapest, Hungary,” that he is incapable of returning to the country to sign the petition himself, more so when he also indicated in the same SPA, his residence in the Philippines (i.e. “I, FERNANDO C. CLAVECILLA, of legal age, Filipino, married, and resident of Torokvesz utca 36/D, 1025 Budapest, Hungary, and/or No. 32 Jacob Extension, Barangay Liboton, Naga City”). Altres clearly laid down the requirement that there should be sufficient justification for the parties’ inability to sign the certification personally.\n",
      "However, a perusal of the instant petition reveals that petitioner manifested his inability to physically sign the certification because he was assigned and detailed in Budapest, Hungary, as a finance officer of the Philippine Embassy. This circumstance sufficiently explains petitioner’s absence in the country and his inability to personally sign the petition. Hence, there can be no valid objection against petitioner’s failure to personally sign the verification and certification against forum shopping.      \n",
      "\n",
      "The instant petition is exempted from the rule that only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another procedural challenge posed by Marivic and the OSG, concerns the factual matters raised in the instant petition which, they argue, are improper in a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\n",
      "The Rules of Court requires that only questions of law may be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45, since factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari. It is not the function of this Court to once again analyze or weigh evidence that has already been considered in the lower courts.\n",
      "However, the bar on factual issues admits of certain reasonable deviations, such as when the judgment is based on a misappreciation of facts or when the findings of fact of the CA are conflicting or contrary to those of the trial court.\n",
      "In view of the conflicting findings of the RTC and the CA, the rule prohibiting factual issues from being raised in a petition for review under Rule 45 shall be set aside to settle the controversies inherent in this case. As such, the procedural challenge against the inclusion of factual matters in the instant case fails.      \n",

      "Either spouse may petition the court to declare their marriage as null and void under Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marivic avers that petitioner came to court with unclean hands, having allegedly engaged in extramarital affairs and, thereafter, claimed to be psychologically incapacitated in order to break free from the marriage bond. As such, he should not be allowed to benefit from his own misdeed.\n",
      "The Court would like to clarify that although sexual infidelity is a ground for legal separation under Art. 55 of the Family Code, it may be deemed as a manifestation of psychological incapacity. Castillo v. Republic elucidated that there must be evidence linking the unfaithfulness with the inability to perform essential spousal obligations:\n",
      "In order for sexual infidelity to constitute as psychological incapacity, the respondent’s unfaithfulness must be established as a manifestation of a disordered personality, completely preventing the respondent from discharging the essential obligations of the marital state; there must be proof of a natal or supervening disabling factor that effectively incapacitated him from complying with the obligation to be faithful to his spouse. It is indispensable that the evidence must show a link, medical or the like, between the acts that manifest psychological incapacity and the psychological disorder itself.\n",
      "Accordingly, the allegation of marital infidelity cannot be automatically ruled as an invalid ground to declare a marriage void ab initio. As long as the alleged sexual infidelity stemmed from the psychological incapacity of the unfaithful spouse, then it can be a valid ground for declaration of nullity of marriage under Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "Another point that needs further elucidation, concerns Marivic’s reference to the principle of unclean hands as a bar against a purported psychologically incapacitated spouse to initiate a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage.\n",
      "The doctrine of unclean hands originated from the maxim “he who comes into equity must come there with clean hands.” It is a frequently stated maxim which is also expressed in the principle that he or she who has done inequity shall not have equity. It signifies that a litigant may be denied relief by a court of equity on the ground that his or her conduct has been inequitable, unfair and dishonest, or fraudulent, or deceitful as to the controversy in issue. Equity refuses to offer its aid in any manner to one seeking its active interposition who has been guilty of unlawful or inequitable conduct in the matter with relation to which he seeks relief. The early case of North Negros Sugar Co., Inc. v. Hidalgo explained the unclean hands doctrine as follows:\n",
      "Coming into Equity with Clean Hands. — The maxim that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands is, of course, applicable in suits to obtain relief by injunction. Injunction will be denied even though complainant shows that he has a right and would otherwise be entitled to the remedy in case it appears that he himself acted dishonestly, fraudulently or illegally in respect to the matter in which redress is sought, or where he has encouraged, invited or contributed to the injury sought to be enjoined. However, the general principle that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands applies only to plaintiff’s conduct in relation to the very matter in litigation. The want of equity that will bar a right to equitable relief for coming into court with unclean hands must be so directly connected with the matter in litigation that it has affected the equitable relations of the parties arising out of the transaction in question. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "The Court had the occasion to apply the unclean hands doctrine in the 1934 case of Villanueva v. Villanueva (Villanueva), which involved an action for support filed by the wife against her husband. When the case was decided in favor of the wife, the husband mortgaged some of his properties, left the country, and abandoned his family without any visible means of support. In executing the judgment, the sheriff seized and subsequently sold the properties, which the wife bought as partial payment for the judgment she had secured. The husband later sought to annul the sheriff sale, contending that the wife cannot enter into such transaction without his consent. In rejecting the claim, the Court applied the unclean hands doctrine and held that the husband should not be allowed to benefit from his act of depriving his family of support. The Court noted that after violating his marital obligations, the husband had the temerity to seek equitable relief through an annulment of deed of sale that was aimed at leaving his wife and children in absolute want.\n",
      "Notable, however, that except for the case of Villanueva, there has been no other occasion wherein the Court resolved a conflict between spouses by applying the unclean hands doctrine, especially one involving a petition to declare nullity of marriage under Art. 36 of the Family Code.\n",
      "At any rate, the Court does not see any reason why the principle of clean hands should prevent a psychologically incapacitated spouse from initiating a proceeding to annul a marriage. This is because there is no party at fault in case of annulment of marriage based on psychological incapacity. Culpability cannot be imputed on the part of the spouse said to be psychologically incapacitated since it is not deliberate or intentional on his or her part to possess such personality trait. By reason of psychological incapacity, it cannot be said that bad faith had motivated the afflicted spouse to enter into a marriage or to even seek for a declaration of its nullity. It must be emphasized that the unclean hands doctrine only avails in cases of inequity, which does not exist in a marriage sought to be annulled on the basis of psychological incapacity of a spouse to comprehend and discharge the concomitant marital obligations.\n",
      "Most importantly, Art. 36 of the Family Code does not prohibit the psychologically incapacitated spouse from initiating the action. Indeed, under the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, (the Rule) the Court allows either of the spouses to file the petition, alleging specifically, the facts showing the incapacity of either or both of them:\n",
      "Section 2. Petition for Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages. –\n",
      "(a) Who may file. – A petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage may be filed solely by the husband or the wife.\n",
      "(d) What to allege. – A petition under Article 36 of the Family Code shall specifically allege the complete facts showing that either or both parties were psychologically incapacitated from complying with the essential marital obligations of marriages at the time of the celebration of marriage even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its celebration.\n",
      "The complete facts should allege the physical manifestations, if any, as are indicative of psychological incapacity at the time of the celebration of the marriage but expert opinion need not be alleged. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "The recent case of Republic v. Claur reinforces Sec. 2(d) of the Rule that a petition for nullity of marriage may be filed by either spouses, whether incapacitated or not. In this case, both the wife and the husband were found to have been psychologically incapacitated. Verily, the courts do not limit the right to initiate a petition to nullify the marriage to the spouse who is not psychologically incapacitated.\n",
      "It therefore becomes of no moment whether the spouse should be free from psychological incapacity before he or she may be allowed to petition the courts for nullity of marriage. What is relevant is for the petition to contain specific allegations of the incapacity of either or both spouses from complying with the essential marital obligations at the time of the marriage.\n",
      "It likewise bears emphasizing that the minutes of the February 9, 1984 Joint Meeting of the Civil Code Revision and the IBP Family Law Committees provide proper perspective on the intention of the framers to allow either spouses, whether psychologically incapacitated or not, to initiate the petition. The relevant portions of the minutes read:\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments and Suggestions of Archbishop Oscar Cruz on the Proposed Provision on Judicial Declaration of Invalidity of Marriage\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Article 1.\n",
      "Either party may obtain a judicial declaration that a marriage is invalid whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that any of the following grounds existed at but was made manifest after the celebration of the marriage;\n",
      "1) That either party was wanting in the use of reason to appreciate the nature of marriage as permanent union between man and woman for the establishment of a family and the creation of reciprocal rights and duties essential to marriage;\n",
      "2) That either party acted under a mistake regarding the identity or capacity to marry of the other at the time of the celebration of the marriage;\n",
      "3) That either party was psychologically or mentally incapacitated to discharge the essential obligations of marriage as prescribed in the next succeeding article.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the opening phrase “Either party may”, Bishop Cruz inquired if the same would mean that the culpable cause of nullity can also file action for judicial declaration of invalidity of marriage. Justice Reyes explained that the said phrase was being proposed inasmuch as ordinary annulment of marriage is open only to innocent parties. Bishop Cruz remarked that if this is the intention, then there is no estoppel if one is the culpable cause.\n",
      "Director Romero stated that they also intend to keep the provisions on annulment of marriage.\n",
      "Clearly, the intent of the framers was to enable either party to file the petition for annulment on the ground of psychological incapacity unlike the other grounds for declaring a marriage void. Such was the intent of the framers of the Family Code that, even during the August 2 and August 9, 1986 meetings of the Civil Code Revision and the IBP Family Law Committees, there was no mention on whether the spouse who may initiate the action should be free from any psychological incapacity:\n",
      "Justice Puno observed that under the present draft provision, it is enough to show that at the time of the celebration of the marriage, one was psychologically incapacitated so that later on if already he can comply with the essential marital obligations, the marriage is still void ab initio. Justice Caguioa explained that since in divorce, the psychological incapacity may occur after the marriage, in void marriages, it has to be at the time of the celebration of the marriage. He, however, stressed that the idea in the provision is that at the time of the celebration of the marriage, one is psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations, which incapacity continues and later becomes manifest.\n",
      "Justice Puno formulated the next article as follows:\n",
      "Article 37. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated, to comply with the essential obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void from the beginning even if such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization.\n",
      "Justice Caguioa suggested that “even if” be substituted with “although”. On the other hand, Prof. Bautista proposed that the clause “although such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization” be deleted since it may encourage one to create the manifestation of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa pointed out that, as in other provisions, they cannot argue on the basis of abuse.\n",
      "Evident from the abovequoted minutes that what is required in filing a petition for nullity of marriage is the presence of psychological incapacity. It will not be significant to the courts whether the petitioner spouse is free from such incapacity. The only requirement is that at least one of them is psychologically incapacitated to comprehend and discharge their marital obligations. If the intention of the framers was to prohibit the incapacitated spouse, they would have expressly stated so, similar to actions to annul a voidable marriage under Art. 47 of the Family Code.      \n",
      "\n",
      "Standards in determining psychological incapacity\n",
      "\n",
      "Art. 36 of the Family Code, as amended, contemplates an inability to assume basic marital obligations. It does not simply relate to a mere difficulty, refusal, or neglect in performing marital obligations or ill will. Art. 36 reads:\n",
      "Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.\n",
      "The Court first defined the term “psychological incapacity” in Santos v. Court of Appeals as referring to a mental incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants. It is confined to the most serious cases of personality disorders resulting in an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage. In the same case, the Court made reference to the work of Dr. Gerardo Veloso, former Presiding Judge of the Metropolitan Tribunal of the Catholic Archdiocese of Manila (Branch I), when he described psychological incapacity as characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.\n",
      "Following these criteria, the Court promulgated Molina where it laid down the following guidelines in determining psychological incapacity:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) The root cause of the psychological incapacity must be (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by experts[,] and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires that the incapacity must be psychological — not physical, although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the court that the parties, or one of them, was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the principle of ejusdem generis, nevertheless such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at “the time of the celebration” of the marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or incurable. \n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Such illness must be grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect by our courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "(8) The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal and the Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the state. No decision shall be handed down unless the Solicitor General issues a certification, which will be quoted in the decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement or opposition, as the case may be, to the petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Court later recognized in Ngo Te v. Yu-Te (Ngo Te) that the resiliency adopted by the framers of the Family Code had been rendered ineffectual by the strict standards in Molina. Hence, in declaring the marriage of the parties in Ngo Te as null and void, the Court emphasized that the courts should interpret psychological incapacity on a case-to-case basis instead of applying a priori assumptions, predilections or generalizations.\n",
      "In the subsequent case of Kalaw, to which petitioner attaches his cause, the Court viewed the Molina guidelines as having been too rigid to such point as to practically reject all petitions for declaration of nullity. The Court also emphasized that actual medical examination of the spouses need not be resorted to if the totality of evidence presented sufficiently sustains the finding of psychological incapacity.\n",
      "Most recently, the Court promulgated Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan­-Andal) which revisited the Molina guidelines. Tan-Andal abandoned the second Molina guideline of requiring expert evidence to prove psychological incapacity. The Court ruled that since psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder, the proof required should be that which will establish the durable or enduring aspects of the spouse’s personality structure. Such personality structure manifests as clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family by disabling the affected spouse to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations.\n",
      "Since psychological incapacity relates to the personality structure of spouses, Tan-Andal declared that the element of incurability required by Art. 36 of the Family Code be determined from a legal, not medical, point of view. It must be enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, which will inevitably result in the irreparable breakdown of the marriage. This personality aspect need not be proven by an expert, but may be established by ordinary witnesses who have consistently observed the behavior of the incapacitated spouse.\n",
      "Evidently, the prevailing standards in determining psychological incapacity were those laid down in Tan-Andal. Hence, the Court, in Cayabyab-Navarrosa v. Navarrosa, accordingly refined the requisites of juridical antecedence, incurability, and gravity in determining psychological incapacity as follows:\n",
      "In light of the Court’s fundamental paradigm shift in viewing psychological incapacity as a purely legal, rather than a medical concept, the understanding of the requisites in determining psychological incapacity, namely, juridical antecedence, incurability, and gravity, must be refined accordingly.\n",
      "With regard to the requisite of incurability, it must now be recognized that psychological incapacity is incurable only in the legal (not medical) sense in that the incapacity is “so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, and contemplates a situation where the couple’s respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage.” In order for the said requisite to obtain, there must be “[a]n undeniable pattern of a persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse that must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, the requisite of gravity in psychological incapacity must be such that it is caused by a genuinely psychic cause, and not just “mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes [or] occasional emotional outbursts” nor mere “refusal, neglect[,] difficulty, much less ill will.” As such, “a deeper and fuller assessment of the alleged incapacity must be done such that it is clearly and convincingly shown that the fulfillment of the essential marital obligations is not merely feigned or cumbersome but rather, practically impossible, because of the distinct psychological makeup of the person relative to his or her spouse.”\n",
      "Lastly, the requisite of juridical antecedence (which – to note – is explicitly necessitated by the phrase “at the time of the celebration of the marriage” in Article 36) means that the incapacity is determined to exist during the time of celebration. While it may indeed be difficult – if not scientifically impossible – to determine the existence of psychological incapacity at the exact point in time that the couple exchanged their ‘I dos,’ it is sufficient, however, that the petitioner demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the incapacity, in all reasonable likelihood, already exists at the time of the marriage’s celebration. To determine the reasonable likelihood of its existence at the time of the celebration of the marriage, the Court, in Tan-Andal, held that “proof of juridically antecedent psychological incapacity may consist of testimonies describing the environment where the supposedly incapacitated spouse lived that may have led to a particular behavior.”\n",
      "Moreover, the concept of juridical antecedence must be understood to include the ordinary experiences of the spouses not only prior to the marriage itself, but more importantly, during their “lived conjugal life” together since, as the law itself states, a marriage can be declared null and void under Article 36 “even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.” As the parties have yet to assume any of the essential marital obligations prior to being married, the Court discerns that the experience of marriage itself is the litmus test of self-realization, reflecting one’s true psychological makeup as to whether or not he or she was indeed capable of assuming the essential marital obligations to his or her spouse at the time the marriage was entered into.\n",
      "Therefore, in order to determine juridical antecedence, “judges must reconstruct the marital decision-making process of an individual, just like inquisitive investigators. The judge must trace back and examine all the manifestations before and during marriage to find out if such non-fulfillment relates to the intrinsic psychological makeup of the person relative to his or her specific partner, and not just some mere difficulty that ordinary spouses, at some point in time, are bound to go through.\n",
      "Overall, the focus should be on the manifestations during the marriage itself since, as intended by Canon Law from which psychological incapacity was patterned after, the lived conjugal life is that which provides a confirmation of the original consent or its absence at the time of the marriage’s celebration. Since there is no way to determine the existence of psychological incapacity at the exact point that vows were exchanged, it is enough that it exists at such time in all reasonable likelihood. This is determined, in turn, by the manifestations and circumstances attending before, and most significantly, during the marriage. (Underscoring supplied, emphases omitted)\n",
      "Finally, the Court, in Tan-Andal, declared that what the plaintiff-spouse in nullity cases under Art. 36 of the Family Code needs, is clear and convincing evidence. Such quantum of proof requires more than preponderant evidence but less than proof beyond reasonable doubt. Based on these guidelines, the Court will now determine whether petitioner was able to establish his claim of psychological incapacity. It must be emphasized that petitioner primarily insists that it is Marivic who is psychologically incapacitated, while the finding of Dr. Tayag that he was the one afflicted with incapacity, was his alternative argument. Hence, the following discussion will not only focus on whether there is clear and convincing evidence to establish petitioner’s psychological incapacity, but also whether he has sufficiently proven his claim that it was Marivic who failed to discharge and comprehend the essential marital obligations.      \n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner failed to present clear and convincing evidence of psychological incapacity either on his or on Marivic’s part.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recall, petitioner described Marivic as carefree, a consistent nagger, and a very demanding wife, who preferred the company of friends. However, his claims not only remained to be unsubstantiated, but were also insufficient to establish psychological incapacity. His complaints against Marivic appear to be minor, and do not have any relevance to her inability to perform essential marital obligations.\n",
      "Petitioner laments that Marivic appears to have no interest in contributing to the family’s income despite his prodding. Still, this allegation is not enough to convince the Court of her psychological incapacity.\n",
      "The standards in determining whether Marivic is psychologically incapacitated are laid down in Arts. 68 to 71 of the Family Code. Said provisions refer to spousal obligations which range from living together, observing mutual love, respect and fidelity, rendering mutual help and support, fixing the family domicile, support, and management of the household. Despite this myriad of spousal obligations, it was only in one aspect where Marivic, in the eyes of petitioner, failed in her duties, effectively admitting that she had no difficulty in performing the remaining obligations.\n",
      "Regardless, Marivic was able to sufficiently refute petitioner’s allegations of her supposed inability and unwillingness to contribute to the family’s income. The documents she presented (i.e. the certification from the International Operations Group of the Pag-IBIG Fund, Contract of Services with the Philippine Overseas Labor Office in Milan, Italy, etc.) reasonably prove that she was able to find work during their marriage, thus, enabling her to also provide for the financial needs of the family.\n",
      "Neither can petitioner rely on the interview conducted by Dr. Tayag on Apalisok and Pimentel, who related that Marivic did not exert any effort to find work. Their interviews did not provide any specific circumstances that could have established Marivic’s indifference to the needs of her family in relation to her duties as a wife.\n",
      "To reiterate, psychological incapacity does not simply connote difficulty, refusal, or neglect in performing marital obligations. It is pertinent to prove, based on the ruling in Tan-Andal, that the spouse is incapable of discharging those obligations by reason of a dysfunctional personality structure. Evidently, petitioner failed to establish his claim that Marivic was the psychologically incapacitated spouse.\n",
      "In a similar vein, the Court rejects petitioner’s alternative argument that he is psychologically incapacitated based on Dr. Tayag’s findings. He insists that Dr. Tayag’s report had established the root cause, gravity, incurability, and incapacitating nature of his NPD.\n",
      "The Court remains unpersuaded.\n",
      "The ruling in Tan-Andal is clear that there must be proof of the consistent behavior of the psychologically incapacitated spouse. This shall consist of an undeniable pattern of failing to be present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive. There was none in this case.\n",
      "Petitioner heavily relied on the report of Dr. Tayag, but there was nothing in her report which indicated a pattern indicating his inability to perform the essential spousal obligations. The said report merely provided a general description of petitioner’s family background without explaining how his relationship with his family, and even significant experiences during childhood, may have affected his personality structure. Being the youngest in the family with parents who want him to be strong and not pathetic, would not suffice to convince the Court that such aspirations from his parents would affect, later on, his interpersonal relationships and inability to comprehend and discharge spousal duties.\n",
      "To be clear, the Court does not doubt the diagnosis of Dr. Tayag – this is one aspect of the report that the Court will not tread on, as it is not an expert in the field of psychology or human behavior. However, her report lacked specific instances of petitioner’s behavior inconsistent with that of a husband who is always present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive towards Marivic.\n",
      "The interviews conducted on Apalisok and Pimentel likewise did not offer any glimpse into petitioner’s personality traits and behavior before and during his marriage with Marivic.\n",
      "More importantly, petitioner failed to impress upon the Court that his NPD impaired his ability to discharge the essential marital obligations under Arts. 68 to 71 of the Family Code. To reiterate, psychological incapacity should be viewed in the legal sense, and not in the medical sense. In sum, the totality of the evidence presented by petitioner failed to establish that his enduring personality structure rendered him incapable of comprehending and discharging his marital obligations in terms of juridical antecedence, gravity, and incurability in the legal sense.\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The June 30, 2016 Decision and the October 7, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 101689 are AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Facts \n",
      "\n",
      "Following the directive of then President Rodrigo R. Duterte in July 2016, former Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General, now Senator, Ronald M. Dela Rosa (Dela Rosa) led the efforts in the suppression of crime and illegal drugs. The PNP implemented Oplan Double Barrel, which consists of Oplan Tokhang and Project High Value Target/Low Value Target. The former involved police officers visiting the homes of suspected drug offenders to persuade them to stop using or peddling illegal drugs, while the latter focused on big-time and small-time drug personalities and their accomplices in the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dela Rosa reported that from July 1, 2016 to August 11, 2016, the government’s campaign against illegal drugs resulted to the surrender of 518,310 drug users and 45,799 drug pushers to the authorities and the apprehension of 7,830 drug personalities. However, during the same period, there was likewise an observed spate of killings of suspected drug personalities allegedly committed by or with the complicity of State agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the varying statistics on the aforementioned killings from the PNP which were published in several news articles, the petitioners concluded that there is a lack of genuine, thorough, prompt, impartial, and independent investigation thereon. They allege that apart from some “high-profile cases and possibly a handful of others, many alleged extrajudicial killings remain uninvestigated.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, this Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The petitioners argue that Dela Rosa, former Commission on Human Rights (CHR) Chairperson Jose Luis Martin C. Gascon (Gascon), now deceased, and then Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II (Aguirre) (collectively, the respondents) have failed to adequately perform their duty to prevent violations of the right to life and to investigate and prosecute the same under the Constitution, pertinent laws, and human rights treaties to which the Philippines is a party. They further contend that the respondents should be directed, through a writ of continuing mandamus, to:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) perform their duty to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violations of the right to life under the Constitution and domestic laws, and in compliance with the Philippines’ obligations under international human rights instruments;\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) investigate each and every allegation of violation of the right to life committed under the government’s anti-illegal drug operations, such as Oplan Tokhang and Oplan Double Barrel, and prosecute perpetrators when warranted;\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) adopt adequate positive measures to prevent any and all further violations of the right to life in the course of the government’s anti-illegal drug operations; and\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) require the respondents to submit periodic reports to the Court, and make the same public, on:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) the actual number of extrajudicial killings and the circumstances thereof;\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii) the progress of the investigation of each case until all investigations are completed and appropriate criminal charges are filed in courts; and\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii) the positive measures adopted to prevent further violations of the right to life and the implementation thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Comment [On the Petition for Mandamus dated September 4, 2017], dated February 20, 2018, Gascon maintained that the CHR has fulfilled and continues to fulfill its constitutional mandate to investigate violations of the right to life, and that its power to investigate such violations is not ministerial in nature. He countered that the petitioners: (a) failed to establish any breach of duty on the part of the CHR; (b) did not show that the CHR’s conduct of investigations on the deaths in relation to Oplan Double Barrel fall short of the standards under international law; and (c) were unable to prove that they had no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law against the CHR.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their part, in the Comment [on the Petition for Mandamus dated September 4, 2017], dated March 16, 2018, Dela Rosa and Aguirre, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), contended that the petitioners have no locus standi to file the present case and that a writ of continuing mandamus is limited only to the enforcement of environmental laws. They further asserted that even assuming that such is not the case, the said writ may still not be issued against them, as the acts which the petitioners seek for the PNP and the DOJ to perform are not simply ministerial but require the exercise of discretion. The OSG also argued that requiring the PNP and the DOJ to submit periodic reports to the Court effectively makes the latter their supervisor, in violation of the basic constitutional precept of separation of powers.\n",
      " [SEP] The Issue\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus to compel the respondents to perform their duty to protect the right to life and to submit periodic accomplishment reports thereon to the Court warranted in this case?\n",
      " [SEP] As concerned citizens and members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Anna May V. Baquirin, Mary Jane N. Real, Maria Lulu G. Reyes, Joan Dymphna G. Saniel, and Evalyn G. Ursua (collectively, the petitioners) come before the Court with the present Petition for Mandamus, praying for the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus to compel the respondents to perform their duties under the Constitution, pertinent laws, and treaties pertaining to violations of the right to life and investigation and prosecution thereof, and to report to the Court the measures they will be taking in carrying out such duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ruling of the Court\n",
      "\n",
      "The Petition is bereft of merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A writ of mandamus is a remedy granted by law when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use or enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled. It has been recognized as an appropriate remedy to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify, when proper, acts of legislative and executive officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "For such writ to be issued in a case alleging an officer’s neglect of duty, as in this case, a concurrence between a clear legal right accruing to the petitioner and a correlative duty incumbent upon the respondent to perform an act, this duty being imposed upon them by law, is required. The respondent must likewise be shown to have actually neglected to perform the act mandated by law. This duty must likewise be ministerial, rather than discretionary in nature, because courts cannot subvert legally vested authority on the respondent to exercise discretion. A mandamus petition will also not prosper unless it is shown that there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The petitioners have no standing to file the Petition and they violated the doctrine on hierarchy of courts\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal standing is the right to appear before a court of justice on a given question. It calls for more than just a generalized grievance, particularly referring to a personal and substantial interest in a case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the challenged governmental act. This notwithstanding, in constitutional cases often brought through public actions and the relief prayed for is likely to affect other persons, non-traditional plaintiffs have been given standing by the Court provided specific requirements have been met. To illustrate, a person may sue as a concerned citizen, provided that he alleges that he has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the act complained of.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the petitioners contend that as concerned citizens, they have the demandable right to government agencies’ due performance of their duties with respect to the protection of the right to life. Notably, there were no allegations in the Petition of any injury they suffered or were about to suffer by reason of the alleged non-performance of the respondents’ duties. The petitioners also invoke the original jurisdiction of the Court, because “[t]he protection of the right to life and the rule of law are at stake,” without mention of the absence of any other remedy they could have taken against the respondents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The petitioners admit their lack of standing and failure to observe the principle of hierarchy of courts.  Nonetheless, they implore the Court to dispense with these procedural requirements due to the transcendental importance of the issues raised in the Petition. The petitioners reason that “[t]he Government’s anti-illegal drug operations have reportedly resulted in an unprecedented number of deaths nationwide, many allegedly in the hands of the police” and that “[t]he lack of genuine, thorough, prompt, impartial, and independent investigations of allegations of extrajudicial killings related to the Government’s anti-illegal drug operations endangers the lives of thousands of Filipinos all over the country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, the Court has ruled that the general invocation of transcendental importance is not a talisman which automatically excuses compliance with technical rules of procedure. Among the factors in the determination of an issue’s transcendental importance to warrant the relaxation of procedural rules are: (a) clear or imminent threat to fundamental rights; (b) the presence of a clear case of disregard of a constitutional or statutory prohibition by the public respondent agency or instrumentality of the government; and (c) the lack of any other party with a more direct and specific interest in raising the questions being raised. Facts must be undisputed, only legal issues must be present, and proper and sufficient justifications why the Court should not simply stay its hand must be clear. This is because the alleged transcendental importance of the issues raised will be better served when there are actual cases with the proper parties suffering an actual or imminent injury. Thus, the Court must exercise restraint in cases that fail to properly present justiciable controversies brought by parties who fail to demonstrate their standing and observe the hierarchy of courts. Otherwise, it may be rendered ineffective to dispense justice as cases clog its docket.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the petitioners failed to show any injury so great and so imminent on their part such that the Court cannot instead adjudicate the issues raised on the occasion of an appropriate case instituted by parties who suffer from direct, substantial, and material injury. They were likewise remiss in justifying their direct resort to the Court and their choice of remedy. On these issues alone, the Petition should be dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The petitioners failed to establish neglect of duty on the part of the respondents\n",
      "\n",
      "The respondents are impleaded in their official capacity as chiefs of the government agencies charged with the duty to protect the right to life: (a) Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6975  mandates the PNP to enforce all laws relative to the protection of lives and investigate and prevent crimes and bring offenders to justice and assist in their prosecution, among others; (b) the Administrative Code designates the DOJ as the State’s principal law agency primarily tasked to administer the criminal justice system in accordance with the accepted processes thereof consisting in the investigation of the crimes, prosecution of offenders, and administration of the correctional system;  and (c) the CHR is an independent office, which the Constitution principally created to investigate, on its own or on complaint by any party, all forms of human rights violations involving civil and political rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently, the respondents, as the then respective heads of the PNP, the DOJ, and the CHR, are duty bound to prevent violations of the right to life and to investigate and/or prosecute such violations when they occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The petitioners assert that the respondents failed to discharge their duties to investigate and prosecute violations of the right to life and to adopt positive measures to prevent any and all further violations of the right to life in the course of the campaign against illegal drugs. In doing so, they cite the absence of reported convictions for extrajudicial killings despite the lapse of one year and the lack of public disclosure of actions taken against persons identified to have been involved in the said killings. In the same breath, however, the petitioners admit that the CHR commenced its motu proprio investigations on the alleged extrajudicial killings and that the DOJ directed the National Bureau of Investigation to investigate the reported killings allegedly related to the campaign against illegal drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides conjectures and conflicting statements, the petitioners offered no concrete proof that the respondents are remiss in their duties. There is not even an indication that the petitioners requested the respondents to furnish them with information on the measures they are taking to address the reported spate of killings. Their bare allegations cannot be given credence, all the more so with respect to the CHR, as Gascon submitted certified true copies of the CHR’s records for each region on their investigations on the extrajudicial and drug-related killings, and the list of trainings they conducted for the police and military sectors from 2016 to 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court also notes the following treaties guaranteeing the right to life, which the petitioners invoked to support their averments: (a) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified on October 23, 1986; (b) the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified on August 21, 1990; and (c) the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (CMW), ratified on July 5, 1995. While State parties, such as the Philippines, are bound to protect the right of every human being to life, they are allowed to do so in accordance with their national law and to the extent of their available resources. In consideration thereof, State parties are essentially obligated to establish a system of accessible and effective remedies through judicial and administrative mechanisms, which ensure that: (a) any person whose rights are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity; (b) any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities, or by any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the State, and to develop the possibilities of judicial remedy; and (c) the competent authorities shall enforce such remedies when granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "State parties to the ICCPR, CRC, and CMW are thus afforded a wide latitude in complying with their obligations thereunder, owing to their sovereignty. Hence, the petitioners cannot impose on the respondents the standards and characteristics of investigation which they deem to be appropriate and sufficient through a Mandamus Petition, as it lies only to compel the performance of purely ministerial duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, the Court cannot grant the reliefs the petitioners seek. As the OSG rightfully argued, the writ of continuing mandamus is available only in environmental cases and requiring the submission of periodic reports on the discharge of the respondents’ functions to the Court violates the fundamental doctrine of separation of powers, which serves to temper the official acts of each branch of the government. While they insist that the respondents failed to uphold their duty to protect the right to life, their contentions are speculative and mere surmises, which the Court has no jurisdiction to rule upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the Petition for Mandamus is DISMISSED.\n",
      "\n",
      "As concerned citizens and members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Anna May V. Baquirin, Mary Jane N. Real, Maria Lulu G. Reyes, Joan Dymphna G. Saniel, and Evalyn G. Ursua (collectively, the petitioners) come before the Court with the present Petition for Mandamus, praying for the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus to compel the respondents to perform their duties under the Constitution, pertinent laws, and treaties pertaining to violations of the right to life and investigation and prosecution thereof, and to report to the Court the measures they will be taking in carrying out such duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Facts \n",
      "\n",
      "Following the directive of then President Rodrigo R. Duterte in July 2016, former Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General, now Senator, Ronald M. Dela Rosa (Dela Rosa) led the efforts in the suppression of crime and illegal drugs. The PNP implemented Oplan Double Barrel, which consists of Oplan Tokhang and Project High Value Target/Low Value Target. The former involved police officers visiting the homes of suspected drug offenders to persuade them to stop using or peddling illegal drugs, while the latter focused on big-time and small-time drug personalities and their accomplices in the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dela Rosa reported that from July 1, 2016 to August 11, 2016, the government’s campaign against illegal drugs resulted to the surrender of 518,310 drug users and 45,799 drug pushers to the authorities and the apprehension of 7,830 drug personalities. However, during the same period, there was likewise an observed spate of killings of suspected drug personalities allegedly committed by or with the complicity of State agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the varying statistics on the aforementioned killings from the PNP which were published in several news articles, the petitioners concluded that there is a lack of genuine, thorough, prompt, impartial, and independent investigation thereon. They allege that apart from some “high-profile cases and possibly a handful of others, many alleged extrajudicial killings remain uninvestigated.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, this Petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The petitioners argue that Dela Rosa, former Commission on Human Rights (CHR) Chairperson Jose Luis Martin C. Gascon (Gascon), now deceased, and then Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II (Aguirre) (collectively, the respondents) have failed to adequately perform their duty to prevent violations of the right to life and to investigate and prosecute the same under the Constitution, pertinent laws, and human rights treaties to which the Philippines is a party. They further contend that the respondents should be directed, through a writ of continuing mandamus, to:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) perform their duty to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violations of the right to life under the Constitution and domestic laws, and in compliance with the Philippines’ obligations under international human rights instruments;\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) investigate each and every allegation of violation of the right to life committed under the government’s anti-illegal drug operations, such as Oplan Tokhang and Oplan Double Barrel, and prosecute perpetrators when warranted;\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) adopt adequate positive measures to prevent any and all further violations of the right to life in the course of the government’s anti-illegal drug operations; and\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) require the respondents to submit periodic reports to the Court, and make the same public, on:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) the actual number of extrajudicial killings and the circumstances thereof;\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii) the progress of the investigation of each case until all investigations are completed and appropriate criminal charges are filed in courts; and\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii) the positive measures adopted to prevent further violations of the right to life and the implementation thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Comment [On the Petition for Mandamus dated September 4, 2017], dated February 20, 2018, Gascon maintained that the CHR has fulfilled and continues to fulfill its constitutional mandate to investigate violations of the right to life, and that its power to investigate such violations is not ministerial in nature. He countered that the petitioners: (a) failed to establish any breach of duty on the part of the CHR; (b) did not show that the CHR’s conduct of investigations on the deaths in relation to Oplan Double Barrel fall short of the standards under international law; and (c) were unable to prove that they had no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law against the CHR.\n",
      "\n",
      "For their part, in the Comment [on the Petition for Mandamus dated September 4, 2017], dated March 16, 2018, Dela Rosa and Aguirre, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), contended that the petitioners have no locus standi to file the present case and that a writ of continuing mandamus is limited only to the enforcement of environmental laws. They further asserted that even assuming that such is not the case, the said writ may still not be issued against them, as the acts which the petitioners seek for the PNP and the DOJ to perform are not simply ministerial but require the exercise of discretion. The OSG also argued that requiring the PNP and the DOJ to submit periodic reports to the Court effectively makes the latter their supervisor, in violation of the basic constitutional precept of separation of powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Issue\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus to compel the respondents to perform their duty to protect the right to life and to submit periodic accomplishment reports thereon to the Court warranted in this case?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ruling of the Court\n",
      "\n",
      "The Petition is bereft of merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A writ of mandamus is a remedy granted by law when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use or enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled. It has been recognized as an appropriate remedy to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify, when proper, acts of legislative and executive officials.\n",

      "For such writ to be issued in a case alleging an officer’s neglect of duty, as in this case, a concurrence between a clear legal right accruing to the petitioner and a correlative duty incumbent upon the respondent to perform an act, this duty being imposed upon them by law, is required. The respondent must likewise be shown to have actually neglected to perform the act mandated by law.

      "Facts of the Case\n",
      "\n",
      "This case originated from a complaint for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of a Parcel of Land with Damages and Attorney’s Fees filed by respondents Joselito, Margarito, Jr. and William, all surnamed Capala; Maria Lily Capala Flores, Margarita Cabana Olive, and Susan Capala Mendoza (collectively, respondents Capala) against Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "The subject matter of the case involves Lot No. 995-B-2 registered under the name of the late Teodorica Capala (Teodorica), covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 34880 with an area of 64 square meters, more or less, and located along Real St., Poblacion, Ormoc City. Shortly after the death of Teodorica on November 1, 1982, herein respondents Capala, as her heirs, searched for documents, titles and papers of the real properties left by their mother. They discovered that the subject property was already occupied by Spouses Valenzuela who claimed to be the owners or mortgagees thereof but they did not show any document to prove their ownership of said property.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only in March 1996 when their aunt, Engr. Rosita Cabana, gave to them a photocopy of a Contract to Buy dated December 1, 1978 purportedly executed by Teodorica and petitioner Brenda Valenzuela on December 1, 1978, the former committing to sell, and the latter to buy, the subject property for the consideration of P35,000.00; the amount of P10,000.00 has been allegedly paid in advance; and the balance to be paid upon the delivery of the title. Respondents Capala alleged that Spouses Valenzuela intentionally concealed the document from their knowledge so that they can continually possess the property unlawfully in order to derive income from the monthly rentals paid from 1979 to the present. Respondents Capala claimed that because of the death of Teodorica on November 1, 1982, the alleged Contract to Buy was extinguished, terminating whatever rights and obligations created thereof between the contracting parties. But Spouses Valenzuela hid and concealed the real status of the Contract to Buy from them to perpetuate their unlawful occupancy over the subject property. Repeated demands to return the subject property, and the subsequent barangay conciliation, proved futile. Hence, respondents Capala filed this complaint on August 3, 1999 praying that after due hearing, judgment be rendered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ordering the defendants (Spouses Valenzuela) to turn over and return the property, Lot No. 955-B-2, now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34880 registered in the name of TEODORICA C. CAPALA, in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Ormoc City to the herein plaintiffs (respondents Capala);\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Ordering the defendants to immediately vacate the premises of the lot in question;\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Condemning the defendants to pay jointly and solidarily to the plaintiffs, the following sums:\n",
      "\n",
      "x x x x\n",
      "\n",
      "In their Answer with Counterclaim, Spouses Valenzuela countered that they have been in open, continuous and public possession of the property since the execution of the Contract to Buy on December 1, 1978, and long before the death of Teodorica. They averred that when Teodorica needed money in 1978, she sought the assistance of petitioner Brenda Valenzuela for the sale of the subject property to interested buyers. As the land has been the subject of litigation between Teodorica and Esmeralda T. Madjus, aside from the fact that the certificate of title thereof was in the name of one Pedro Codilla who mortgaged the land to a bank, no one was interested to buy the land. Badly in need of financial assistance, Teodorica offered to sell the property to petitioner Brenda Valenzuela for P35,000.00 with P10,000.00 to be paid as earnest money and credited as part of the purchase price, and the balance of P25,000.00 to be paid upon delivery of the TCT. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela accepted the offer out of pity, considering that Teodorica’s late husband was her relative. Thus, they executed the Contract to Buy notarized by Atty. Bruno A. Villamor, the lawyer of Teodorica in the civil case against Esmeralda T. Madjus. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela paid the sum of P10,000.00 as earnest money and advance payment for the purchase of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the execution of the Contract to Buy, the certificate of title of the land was still in the name of Pedro Codilla. After Teodorica obtained a favorable judgment in the civil case against Esmeralda T. Madjus, it was agreed that Teodorica would work for the issuance and transfer of the certificate of title to her name and the payment of the balance of P25,000.00 would be paid by petitioner Brenda Valenzuela upon delivery of the title. Pertinent portion of the Contract to Buy reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "That the remaining balance of P25,000.00, shall be paid by the Party for the Second Part to the Party for the First Part, as soon as the Transfer Certificate of Title shall be delivered by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part, and when this is complied [with,] a Final Deed of Sale of this lot shall be executed by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years passed, Teodorica was unable to deliver the title. Instead she asked petitioner Brenda Valenzuela additional money to pay her loan obligations to the Rural Bank of Ormoc City, the education of her children and her family’s daily subsistence. Spouses Valenzuela paid P17,500.00 to the Rural Bank of Ormoc City, and gave to Teodorica the sum of P10,000.00 for the education of the latter’s children. It was then understood that these additional amounts were to be credited to Spouses Valenzuela’s unpaid balance of the purchase price of the land. For Spouses Valenzuela, they have fully paid the purchase price and what remains is the delivery of the title to them and the execution of the Final Deed of Sale in their favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of counterclaim, Spouses Valenzuela contend that it is now incumbent upon respondents Capala, as heirs and successors-in-interest of Teodorica, to deliver the TCT considering that it has already been issued in the name of Teodorica on June 4, 1999 and considering further that they have paid the balance of P25,000.00. Even if the payments they made would not be credited, respondents Capala are still under obligation to deliver the TCT and to execute in their favor a Final Deed of Sale, and once these are done, Spouses Valenzuela are still ready and willing to pay the balance of P25,000.00. They prayed that judgment be rendered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Declaring the defendants (Spouses Valenzuela) the owners of the land in question;\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Ordering the plaintiffs (respondents Capala) to deliver to the defendants Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34880 and to execute in favor of the latter a Final Deed of Sale over the land in question;\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Granting the defendants’ counterclaim fully as alleged herein.\n",

      "On March 13, 2000, respondents Capala filed, upon motion for leave, an Amended Complaint to emphasize that their principal cause of action was to declare the Contract to Buy null and void, Teodorica’s signature therein being forged. They alleged that the signature appearing on top of the name of Teodorica could not be hers as it materially differs from the signature of the late Teodorica as appearing on the other documents retrieved by respondents Capala and bearing the signature of the deceased. They prayed that after due hearing, judgment be rendered;\n",

      "In the Order dated June 1, 2000, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the motion for leave to amend complaint but denied the motion to correct the admission.\n",

      "Spouses Valenzuela amended their Answer additionally asserting that the Contract to Buy is a genuine and authentic document. They insisted that Teodorica’s delivery of the subject property to Spouses Valenzuela upon execution of the contract is the best proof that the contract is genuine and authentic, otherwise, Teodorica herself, during her lifetime, would have taken steps to annul the same and recover the land. They reiterated their counterclaim in their original answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the witnesses presented by respondents Capala was Romeo Varona (Varona), the Document Examiner of the Regional Crime Laboratory Office of Region VII, Cebu City, who made a conclusion that the questioned signature of Teodorica in the Contract to Buy dated December 1, 1978 and the standard signatures appearing in the documents were written by two different persons. The documents submitted for comparison on which appeared the standard signatures of Teodorica around the same time are: (1) Assessed Value of Property dated January 30, 1976; (2) Application for New/Renewal of Mayor’s Permit to Operate a Business dated January 30, 1976; and (3) Application for Registration of Business dated May 4, 1979. Varona testified that his comparative examination and analysis revealed 18 significant differences in letter formation, construction and other individual handwriting characteristics. He arrived at the conclusion that the questioned signature of Teodorica appearing in the Contract to Buy and the standard signatures appearing in the three mentioned documents were written by two different persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela testified that her copy of the Contract to Buy was lost when it was washed out by flood when typhoon Uring hit Ormoc City in November 1991. She tried to secure a copy from notary public Atty. Villamor but the latter could not give her a copy as his house was likewise flooded during the said flash flood. She attempted to get a copy from the notarial files of Atty. Villamor in the office of the Clerk of Court, RTC of Ormoc City but with the same result. The receipts evidencing payment of the balance of P25,000.00 were also washed out by the flood.\n",
      " [SEP] Petitioners’ Arguments\n",
      "\n",
      "Spouses Valenzuela argued that the CA erred in stating that they are guilty of laches. It overlooked the following facts: first, Spouses Valenzuela took actual possession of the land after the execution of the Contract to Buy and even constructed a building thereon for their battery business. For more than 20 years, respondents Capala and their mother did nothing to recover the land. Second, long before the death of Teodorica on November 1, 1982, respondents Capala had known that possession of the land had been delivered to Spouses Valenzuela. It was only on August 3, 1999, or 17 years from Teodorica’s death, that respondents Capala filed the present action; hence, there are the ones guilty of laches. Third, the Contract to Buy clearly specified certain conditions so expressly stated. The late Teodorica was under obligation to deliver the TCT to Spouses Valenzuela, and when the delivery is complied with, a Final Deed of Sale of the subject lot be executed in favor of petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. Heirs are bound to respect the contracts entered into by their predecessors-in-interest. Obligations are also transmitted to the heirs of the parties, and they may be compelled to fulfil the same. Respondents Capala were the ones who obtained the TCT on June 4, 1999. It was their obligation to deliver the TCT to Spouses Valenzuela so that the latter can pay the balance of P25,000.00 and thereafter to execute the Final Deed of Sale in the spouses’ favor.\n",
      "Finally, Spouses Valenzuela assailed the award of nominal damages for lack of legal basis and the imposition of attorney’s fees there being no bad faith on their part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Respondents’ Comment\n",
      "\n",
      "Respondents Capala averred that the arguments presented by Spouses Valenzuela are questions of fact which take it out of the scope of the present petition under Rule 45. Contrary to Spouses Valenzuela’s claim, they only learned that the lot was subject to a Contract to Buy on March 1996, then filed the complaint three years thereafter; hence, they cannot be attributed with laches. On the contrary, Spouses Valenzuela knew of this Contract to Buy for more than 20 years already. They even averred that they had paid in full the purchase price and it was the obligation of respondents Capala to comply with the terms of the Contract. If such was the case, Spouses Valenzuela should not have waited until 1999, when the case was filed, to act on their supposed right. The offer to give the rent from the subject property or buy the same if respondents Capala decide to sell it ran counter to petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s assertion that she paid the full purchase price. This leads to the conclusion that there was no payment and thus no vested right accrued to Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "Further, respondents Capala posited that the CA did not err in awarding nominal damages and attorney’s fees. Respondents Capala were unduly deprived of their ownership over the subject property for several years and despite the presence of title by respondents Capala, such was not respected by Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "The issues to be resolved are: (1) whether the CA was correct in ruling that the Contract to Buy was valid and binding, Teodorica’s signature therein being genuine; (2) whether Spouses Valenzuela failed to prove their right to remain in the subject property; consequently, they should turn over the possession thereof to respondents Capala, the successors-in-interest of Teodorica, the registered owner; and (3) whether laches had precluded the claims of Spouses Valenzuela.\n",

The RTC also made its own comparison of the questioned signatures and the standard signatures, taking into consideration the several inconspicuous differences noted by Varona on the questioned and standard signatures and found that the questioned signature showed substantial differences with that of the standard signatures of Teodorica. The conclusion that the said signature on the Contract to Buy is a forgery is strengthened by the fact that Spouses Valenzuela offered to buy the subject property from respondents Capala during the barangay conciliation. There would be no reason to buy the said land if Teodorica indeed signed in the contract. The RTC also ruled that laches had already set in against Spouses Valenzuela.\n",

      "Contrary to Varona’s opinion that Teodorica’s signature is a forgery, the CA found, after a visual examination of the sample signatures of Teodorica and her signature in the Contract to Buy, that there is a striking resemblance and no distinguishing difference. There may be slight dissimilarities but these appear to be natural and inevitable variations that may be expected even in genuine signatures made by one and the same person. The CA found Teodorica’s signature on the Contract to Buy genuine. Coupled with respondents Capala’s admission of said contract’s existence and execution, the CA found the contract valid and binding. This notwithstanding, the CA ruled that Spouses Valenzuela have not proven payment of the balance of the full purchase price of the subject property for them to be entitled to its ownership or the execution of the final deed of sale. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s offer to pay the amount of P25,000.00 during the barangay conciliation and at the trial of the case ran contrary to their claim of full payment and their consequent ownership of the subject land. Further, the CA stated that Spouses Valenzuela’s claims are precluded by laches for they waited for 17 years to assert, as a counterclaim, their alleged rights.

      "The Honorable Court of Appeals committed an error of law in holding that “defendants-appellants’ claims are precluded by laches; but not those of plaintiffs-appellees”.\n",
      "II.\n",
      "The Honorable Court of Appeals, with due respect, erred in imposing nominal damages and attorney’s fees upon the defendants-appellants.\n",

      "Ruling of the Court\n",
      "\n",
      "The petition is meritorious.\n",
      "As a general rule, We do not disturb the factual findings of the appellate court. A re-examination of factual findings cannot be done in a petition for review on certiorari because the Court is not a trier of facts but reviews only questions of law. However, this case falls under one of the recognized exceptions thereto because the factual findings of the trial court and appellate court are conflicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it noted that in their Amended Complaint, respondents Capala emphasized that their principal cause of action was to declare the Contract to Buy null and void, Teodorica’s signature therein being forged. The RTC found Teodorica’s signature as forged; hence, the contract was null and void and without any binding effect. The CA, on the other hand, made its own visual determination and found Teodorica’s signature therein as genuine; hence, the contract is valid and binding. These contrasting findings warrant a re-­examination of the facts of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preliminarily, the Court will discuss the effect of the stipulation made by the parties during the pre-trial, specifically the admission as to the existence of the execution of the Contract to Buy between the Teodorica and Brenda Valenzuela. In the original complaint filed by respondents Capala, they claim that Spouses Valenzuela should now turn over the subject property to them considering the death of Teodorica which extinguished the alleged Contract to Buy, terminating whatever rights and obligations created between the contracting parties. In the amended complaint, respondents Capala changed their principal cause of action to nullity of the Contract to Buy on the basis of forgery, asserting that Teodorica’s signature therein was forged. The contract being a nullity, Spouses Valenzuela should now turn over the possession to respondents Capala.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the pre-trial was conducted prior to the amendment of the complaint. When the motion for leave to amend complaint was granted by the RTC, no other pre-trial was conducted. The Court disagrees with the CA that the admission as the existence and due execution of the Contract to Buy stands. When respondents Capala changed their cause of action in their amended complaint to forgery, said admission no longer applies in their favor considering that it contradicts their claim as to the due execution and genuineness of the contract. Thus, said admission was vacated upon the amended of the complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "This notwithstanding, the Court finds that Teodrica’s signature in the Contract to Buy is genuine, hence, the contract is valid and binding between the parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the RTC Decision, it gave credence to the testimony of Romeo Oliva Varona, Document Examiner of the Regional Crime Laboratory Office of Region VII, Cebu City, that the signature of Teodorica appearing in the Contract to Buy is not hers. Varona testified that his comparative examination and analysis revealed 18 significant differences in letter formation, construction and other individual handwriting characteristics, and arrived at the conclusion that the questioned signature of Teodorica appearing in the subject Contract to Buy acknowledged before Notary Public Bruno A. Villamor dated December 1, 1978 and the standard signatures appearing in the three documents were written by two different persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "It bears stressing that the opinions of handwriting experts are not necessarily binding upon the court, the expert’s function being to place before the court data upon which the court can form its own opinion. This principle holds true especially when the question involved is mere handwriting similarity or dissimilarity, which can be determined by a visual comparison of specimens of the questioned signatures with those of the currently existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Gepulle-Garbo v. Sps. Garabato, the Court explained the factors involved in the examination and comparison of handwritings in this wise:\n",
      "\n",
      "The authenticity of a questioned signature cannot be determined solely upon its general characteristics, similarities or dissimilarities with the genuine signature. Dissimilarities as regards spontaneity, rhythm, pressure of the pen, loops in the strokes, signs of stops, shades, etc., that may be found between the questioned signature and the genuine one are not decisive on the question of the former’s authenticity. The result of examinations of questioned handwriting, even with the benefit of aid of experts and scientific instruments, is, at best, inconclusive. There are other factors that must be taken into consideration. The position of the writer, the condition of the surface on which the paper where the questioned signature is written is placed, his state of mind, feelings and nerves, and the kind of pen and/or paper used, play an important role on the general appearance of the signature. Unless, therefore, there is, in a given case, absolute absence, or manifest dearth, of direct or circumstantial competent evidence on the character of a questioned handwriting, much weight should not be given to characteristic similarities, or dissimilarities, between that questioned handwriting and an authentic one.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a careful and thorough examination of the records of the case, this Court affirms the findings of the CA that Teodorica’s signature in the Contract to Buy is genuine. The CA found that, after a visual examination of the sample signatures of Teodorica and her signature in the Contract to Buy, there is a striking resemblance and no distinguishing difference. While there may be slight dissimilarities, these appear to be natural and inevitable variations that may be expected even in genuine signatures made by one and the same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, this Court made the following observations in finding the signature of Teodorica in the Contract to Buy to be genuine, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Contract to Buy which was examined by Varona, the Document Examiner, is a mere photocopy. Notably, the genuineness and due execution of a photocopy could not be competently established without a copy of the original. Here, the original copy of the Contract to Buy was not even presented in court. Respondent Maria Lily Capala testified on cross that she did not ask from Atty. Bruno A. Villamor, the notary public, the original copy of the Contract to Buy, and she did not go to the Office of the Clerk of Court to get a certified true copy of the same. Since mere photocopy of the subject Contract to Buy was used to examine the questioned and standard signatures of Teodorica, no valid comparison can be had between them. Hence, Varona’s conclusion that the signature of Teodorica appearing in the Contract to Buy is not hers cannot be given due weight and credence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Varona did not make a categorical conclusion that the submitted signatures are the standard signatures of Teodorica. Standard signatures are the genuine signatures of a person for comparison purposes. Respondents Capala submitted to the document examiner the following documents for comparison: (1) Assessed Value of Property dated January 30, 1976 (Exh. “S-1”); (2) Application for New/Renewal of Mayor’s Permit to Operate a Business dated January 30, 1976 (Exh. “S-2”); and (3) Application for Registration of Business dated May 4, 1979 (Exhs. “S-3 to S-4”). In his testimony, Varona declared that he did not conduct an investigation whether the standard signatures in the documents submitted are genuine; all he did was to examine the same and concluded that the signatures were written by one and the same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the Contract to Buy is a notarized document, thus, it is considered a public document. It is a well-settled principle that a duly notarized document enjoys the prima facie presumption of authenticity and due execution, as well as the full faith and credence attached to a public instrument. To overturn this legal presumption, evidence must be clear, convincing, and more than merely preponderant to establish that there was forgery that gave rise to a spurious contract. As also borne in the records, the notary public, Atty. Bruno A. Villamor, testified in court that he prepared and notarized the Contract to Buy; that the signature appearing therein is his; and confirmed that Teodorica’s signature therein is her signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, respondents Capala are estopped to deny the contract entered into by their mother with Brenda Valenzuela. Be it noted that when their mother was still alive, she recognized/acknowledged the contract she executed with petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. Teodorica allowed Spouses Valenzuela to possess the subject property and did not object when the spouses constructed a building for their battery business and where the spouses are now residing. During her lifetime, Teodorica did not take steps to annul the contract and recover the land. Even respondents Capala admitted Spouses Valenzuela’s possession of the subject property from 1979 up to the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heirs are bound by contracts entered into by their predecessors-in-interest. As heirs of Teodorica, respondents Capala are bound by the Contract to Buy executed by their mother in favor of petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. In fact, respondents Capala knew that Spouses Valenzuela had been in possession of the subject property even during the lifetime of their mother. Their mother told them that the subject property is mortgaged to petitioner Brenda Valenzuela, however, their mother did not show any document of mortgage. Be it noted that the parties herein are all residents of Ormoc City, although from different barangays. It would be impossible for respondents Capala not to have noticed the building constructed on the subject property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the finding that the Contract to Buy is a valid and binding contract between Teodorica and Spouses Valenzuela, the CA, however, ruled that Spouses Valenzuela are not entitled to ownership of the property or the execution of the final deed of sale considering that they have not proven the payment of the balance of the full purchase price. The CA declared that petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s offer to pay the amount of P25,000.00 during the barangay conciliation and at the trial of the case ran contrary to their claim of full payment and their consequent ownership of the subject land.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Court disagrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Contract to Buy contains the following provisions:\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Party for the First Part desires to sell said parcel of land aforementioned to the Party for the Second Part for a valuable sum of Thirty Five Thousand Pesos (P35,000.00), Philippine Currency, and a token money or partial amount of which has been acknowledged in this document the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00), has been paid by the Party for the Second Part;\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Party for the Second Part is to buy the land belonging to the Party for the First Part and hereby paid the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to the Party for the First Part, as token money or earnest money acknowledged to have been received in full by the Party for the First Part;\n",
      "\n",
      "That the remaining balance of P25,000.00, shall be paid by the Party for the Second Part to the Party for the First Part, as soon as the Transfer Certificate of Title shall be delivered by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part, and when this is complied a Final Deed of Sale of this lot shall be executed by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be gleaned from the provisions of the contract that Spouses Valenzuela have the obligation to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price as soon as the Transfer Certificate of Title shall have been delivered by Teodorica. As testified by petitioner Brenda Valenzuela, at the time of the execution of the Contract to Buy, the title to the subject property was still in the name of Pedro Codilla. No one was interested to buy the property because of the pending litigation involving the subject property. Hence, the above condition was imposed, i.e., that the payment of the remaining balance of P25,000.00 would be paid by petitioner Brenda Valenzuela upon delivery of the title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that the title to the property has not been delivered, Spouses Valenzuela’s obligation to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price did not arise yet. Spouses Valenzuela cannot be dispossessed from the subject property since the happening of the condition to pay the full purchase price did not take place yet. Records show that after Teodorica obtained a favorable judgment in the civil case (specific performance of contract) against Esmeralda T. Madjus, Teodorica never attempted to have the title transferred in her name. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela kept on reminding Teodorica but the latter told her to wait because Teodorica was so sickly and asking for consideration of her physical health, until her death in November 1, 1982.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears that the TCT in the name of Teodorica Capala was obtained by respondents Capala and it was issued only in June 4, 1999. Respondents Capala filed the complaint in August 3, 1999. Contrary to the CA ruling, Spouses Valenzuela cannot be guilty of laches to assert their rights over the subject property, as a counterclaim in their Answer, since it was only in 1999 that the TCT to the property was issued in the name of Teodorica.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, Spouses Valenzuela claims that they had fully paid the remaining balance of P25,000.00 and what remains is the delivery of the title to them and the execution of the Final Deed of Sale in their favor. In her testimony, petitioner Brenda Valenzuela declared that she was instructed by Teodorica to pay her loan with the Rural Bank of Ormoc City in the amount of P17,000.00 while the remaining amount of P10,000.00 was given to Teodorica for the education of her children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laches is defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time to do that which, by observance of due diligence, could or should have been done earlier. It is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert his right either has abandoned or declined to assert it. In order to constitute laches, the following must be present: (a) conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation complained of; (b) delay in asserting complainant’s rights after he had knowledge of defendant’s acts and after he has had the opportunity to sue; (c) lack of knowledge or notice by defendant that the complainant will assert the right on which he bases his suit; and (d) injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event the relief is accorded to the complainant.\n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed above, Spouses Valenzuela took actual possession of the land after the execution of the Contract to Buy in 1978. They even constructed a building for their battery business and where the spouses are now residing. Teodorica did not object thereto, thereby acknowledging the contract she entered into with petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. As provided for in the contract, the obligation to deliver the title to the property belongs to Teodorica. Spouses Valenzuela had no obligation to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price absent the delivery of the title. Be it noted that it was only in June 4, 1999 that the TCT to the property was issued in the name of Teodorica. The complaint was filed by respondents Capala in August 3, 1999. By way of counterclaim in their Answer, Spouses Valenzuela immediately asserted their right to have the title delivered to them considering the issuance of the TCT in the name of Teodorica. While Spouses Valenzuela contended they have paid the balance of P25,000.00, they are still ready and willing to pay the balance if the payment made would not be credited, provided that respondents Capala shall deliver the TCT and execute a Final Deed of Sale in their favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foregoing considered, it cannot be said that Spouses Valenzuela have already abandoned or declined to assert their right. Without delay, they immediately insisted on their right over the TCT on the same year it was issued. Having possessed and enjoyed the property for more than 20 years, Spouses Valenzuela did not expect that the heirs of Teodorica would still attempt to recover the property from them. Indeed, Spouses Valenzuela, who already spent for the improvement of the subject property, would be prejudiced if respondents Capala will be allowed to recover the possession of the subject property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s offer to pay the amount of P25,000.00 during the barangay conciliation and at the trial of the case does not run counter to their claim of full payment. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela only made an offer of compromise during the barangay conciliation, which was not accepted by respondents Capala.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine the admissibility or non-admissibility of an offer to compromise, the circumstances of the case and the intent of the party making the offer should be considered. Thus, if a party denies the existence of a debt but offers to pay the same for the purpose of buying peace and avoiding litigation, the offer of settlement is inadmissible. If in the course thereof, the party making the offer admits the existence of an indebtedness combined with a proposal to settle the claim amicably, then, the admission is admissible to prove such indebtedness x x x.

      "Applying the foregoing to this case, Spouses Valenzuela’s assertion that they had fully paid the purchase price yet offered to give the monthly rentals of LG Gas to respondents Capala is not an admission of liability. It is not an admission that they have not fully paid the purchase price.\n",

      "Spouses Valenzuela cannot be considered yet as the owner of the subject property, as prayed for in their counterclaim and in this petition. Ownership of the subject property has not been transferred to them despite delivery of the subject property. In a contract to sell, such as the subject Contract to Buy, the absence of a formal deed of conveyance is a strong indication that the parties did not intend immediate transfer of ownership, but only a transfer after full payment of the purchase price. The need to execute a deed of absolute sale upon completion of payment of the price generally indicates that it is a contract to sell, as it implies the reservation of title in the vendor until the vendee has completed the payment of the price.\n",

CV No. 04363 which denied petitioners Spouses Brenda and Anacleto Valenzuela’s (Spouses Valenzuela) appeal and the Resolution dated March 6, 2019 denying their’ motion for reconsideration for want of merit.\n",
      "Facts of the Case\n",
      "\n",
      "This case originated from a complaint for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of a Parcel of Land with Damages and Attorney’s Fees filed by respondents Joselito, Margarito, Jr. and William, all surnamed Capala; Maria Lily Capala Flores, Margarita Cabana Olive, and Susan Capala Mendoza (collectively, respondents Capala) against Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "The subject matter of the case involves Lot No. 995-B-2 registered under the name of the late Teodorica Capala (Teodorica), covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 34880 with an area of 64 square meters, more or less, and located along Real St., Poblacion, Ormoc City. Shortly after the death of Teodorica on November 1, 1982, herein respondents Capala, as her heirs, searched for documents, titles and papers of the real properties left by their mother. They discovered that the subject property was already occupied by Spouses Valenzuela who claimed to be the owners or mortgagees thereof but they did not show any document to prove their ownership of said property.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only in March 1996 when their aunt, Engr. Rosita Cabana, gave to them a photocopy of a Contract to Buy dated December 1, 1978 purportedly executed by Teodorica and petitioner Brenda Valenzuela on December 1, 1978, the former committing to sell, and the latter to buy, the subject property for the consideration of P35,000.00; the amount of P10,000.00 has been allegedly paid in advance; and the balance to be paid upon the delivery of the title. Respondents Capala alleged that Spouses Valenzuela intentionally concealed the document from their knowledge so that they can continually possess the property unlawfully in order to derive income from the monthly rentals paid from 1979 to the present. Respondents Capala claimed that because of the death of Teodorica on November 1, 1982, the alleged Contract to Buy was extinguished, terminating whatever rights and obligations created thereof between the contracting parties. But Spouses Valenzuela hid and concealed the real status of the Contract to Buy from them to perpetuate their unlawful occupancy over the subject property. Repeated demands to return the subject property, and the subsequent barangay conciliation, proved futile. Hence, respondents Capala filed this complaint on August 3, 1999 praying that after due hearing, judgment be rendered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ordering the defendants (Spouses Valenzuela) to turn over and return the property, Lot No. 955-B-2, now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34880 registered in the name of TEODORICA C. CAPALA, in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Ormoc City to the herein plaintiffs (respondents Capala);\n",

      "\n",
      "x x x x\n",
      "\n",
      "In their Answer with Counterclaim, Spouses Valenzuela countered that they have been in open, continuous and public possession of the property since the execution of the Contract to Buy on December 1, 1978, and long before the death of Teodorica. They averred that when Teodorica needed money in 1978, she sought the assistance of petitioner Brenda Valenzuela for the sale of the subject property to interested buyers. As the land has been the subject of litigation between Teodorica and Esmeralda T. Madjus, aside from the fact that the certificate of title thereof was in the name of one Pedro Codilla who mortgaged the land to a bank, no one was interested to buy the land. Badly in need of financial assistance, Teodorica offered to sell the property to petitioner Brenda Valenzuela for P35,000.00 with P10,000.00 to be paid as earnest money and credited as part of the purchase price, and the balance of P25,000.00 to be paid upon delivery of the TCT. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela accepted the offer out of pity, considering that Teodorica’s late husband was her relative. Thus, they executed the Contract to Buy notarized by Atty. Bruno A. Villamor, the lawyer of Teodorica in the civil case against Esmeralda T. Madjus. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela paid the sum of P10,000.00 as earnest money and advance payment for the purchase of the land.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of the execution of the Contract to Buy, the certificate of title of the land was still in the name of Pedro Codilla. After Teodorica obtained a favorable judgment in the civil case against Esmeralda T. Madjus, it was agreed that Teodorica would work for the issuance and transfer of the certificate of title to her name and the payment of the balance of P25,000.00 would be paid by petitioner Brenda Valenzuela upon delivery of the title. Pertinent portion of the Contract to Buy reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "That the remaining balance of P25,000.00, shall be paid by the Party for the Second Part to the Party for the First Part, as soon as the Transfer Certificate of Title shall be delivered by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part, and when this is complied [with,] a Final Deed of Sale of this lot shall be executed by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years passed, Teodorica was unable to deliver the title. Instead she asked petitioner Brenda Valenzuela additional money to pay her loan obligations to the Rural Bank of Ormoc City, the education of her children and her family’s daily subsistence. Spouses Valenzuela paid P17,500.00 to the Rural Bank of Ormoc City, and gave to Teodorica the sum of P10,000.00 for the education of the latter’s children. It was then understood that these additional amounts were to be credited to Spouses Valenzuela’s unpaid balance of the purchase price of the land. For Spouses Valenzuela, they have fully paid the purchase price and what remains is the delivery of the title to them and the execution of the Final Deed of Sale in their favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "By way of counterclaim, Spouses Valenzuela contend that it is now incumbent upon respondents Capala, as heirs and successors-in-interest of Teodorica, to deliver the TCT considering that it has already been issued in the name of Teodorica on June 4, 1999 and considering further that they have paid the balance of P25,000.00. Even if the payments they made would not be credited, respondents Capala are still under obligation to deliver the TCT and to execute in their favor a Final Deed of Sale, and once these are done, Spouses Valenzuela are still ready and willing to pay the balance of P25,000.00. They prayed that judgment be rendered:\n",

      "On March 13, 2000, respondents Capala filed, upon motion for leave, an Amended Complaint to emphasize that their principal cause of action was to declare the Contract to Buy null and void, Teodorica’s signature therein being forged. They alleged that the signature appearing on top of the name of Teodorica could not be hers as it materially differs from the signature of the late Teodorica as appearing on the other documents retrieved by respondents Capala and bearing the signature of the deceased. They prayed that after due hearing, judgment be rendered;\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Declaring the CONTRACT TO BUY allegedly executed by the late teodorica Capala in favor of the defendants dated December 1, 1978 (Annex “C”, Complaint) as null and void and without any legal effect whatsoever;\n",

      "2. Ordering the defendants (Spouses Valenzuela) to turn over the possession of Lot No. 955-B-2, now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34880 registered in the name of TEODORICA C.

      "Spouses Valenzuela amended their Answer additionally asserting that the Contract to Buy is a genuine and authentic document. They insisted that Teodorica’s delivery of the subject property to Spouses Valenzuela upon execution of the contract is the best proof that the contract is genuine and authentic, otherwise, Teodorica herself, during her lifetime, would have taken steps to annul the same and recover the land. They reiterated their counterclaim in their original answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the witnesses presented by respondents Capala was Romeo Varona (Varona), the Document Examiner of the Regional Crime Laboratory Office of Region VII, Cebu City, who made a conclusion that the questioned signature of Teodorica in the Contract to Buy dated December 1, 1978 and the standard signatures appearing in the documents were written by two different persons. The documents submitted for comparison on which appeared the standard signatures of Teodorica around the same time are: (1) Assessed Value of Property dated January 30, 1976; (2) Application for New/Renewal of Mayor’s Permit to Operate a Business dated January 30, 1976; and (3) Application for Registration of Business dated May 4, 1979. Varona testified that his comparative examination and analysis revealed 18 significant differences in letter formation, construction and other individual handwriting characteristics. He arrived at the conclusion that the questioned signature of Teodorica appearing in the Contract to Buy and the standard signatures appearing in the three mentioned documents were written by two different persons.\n",

She tried to secure a copy from notary public Atty. Villamor but the latter could not give her a copy as his house was likewise flooded during the said flash flood. She attempted to get a copy from the notarial files of Atty. Villamor in the office of the Clerk of Court, RTC of Ormoc City but with the same result. The receipts evidencing payment of the balance of P25,000.00 were also washed out by the flood.\n",

The RTC also made its own comparison of the questioned signatures and the standard signatures, taking into consideration the several inconspicuous differences noted by Varona on the questioned and standard signatures and found that the questioned signature showed substantial differences with that of the standard signatures of Teodorica. The conclusion that the said signature on the Contract to Buy is a forgery is strengthened by the fact that Spouses Valenzuela offered to buy the subject property from respondents Capala during the barangay conciliation. There would be no reason to buy the said land if Teodorica indeed signed in the contract. The RTC also ruled that laches had already set in against Spouses Valenzuela.\n",

      "Contrary to Varona’s opinion that Teodorica’s signature is a forgery, the CA found, after a visual examination of the sample signatures of Teodorica and her signature in the Contract to Buy, that there is a striking resemblance and no distinguishing difference. There may be slight dissimilarities but these appear to be natural and inevitable variations that may be expected even in genuine signatures made by one and the same person. The CA found Teodorica’s signature on the Contract to Buy genuine. Coupled with respondents Capala’s admission of said contract’s existence and execution, the CA found the contract valid and binding. This notwithstanding, the CA ruled that Spouses Valenzuela have not proven payment of the balance of the full purchase price of the subject property for them to be entitled to its ownership or the execution of the final deed of sale. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s offer to pay the amount of P25,000.00 during the barangay conciliation and at the trial of the case ran contrary to their claim of full payment and their consequent ownership of the subject land. Further, the CA stated that Spouses Valenzuela’s claims are precluded by laches for they waited for 17 years to assert, as a counterclaim, their alleged rights.

      "Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 filed by Spouses Valenzuela anchored on the following grounds:\n",
      "I.\n",
      "The Honorable Court of Appeals committed an error of law in holding that “defendants-appellants’ claims are precluded by laches; but not those of plaintiffs-appellees”.\n",
      "II.\n",
      "The Honorable Court of Appeals, with due respect, erred in imposing nominal damages and attorney’s fees upon the defendants-appellants.\n",
      "Petitioners’ Arguments\n",
      "\n",
      "Spouses Valenzuela argued that the CA erred in stating that they are guilty of laches. It overlooked the following facts: first, Spouses Valenzuela took actual possession of the land after the execution of the Contract to Buy and even constructed a building thereon for their battery business. For more than 20 years, respondents Capala and their mother did nothing to recover the land. Second, long before the death of Teodorica on November 1, 1982, respondents Capala had known that possession of the land had been delivered to Spouses Valenzuela. It was only on August 3, 1999, or 17 years from Teodorica’s death, that respondents Capala filed the present action; hence, there are the ones guilty of laches. Third, the Contract to Buy clearly specified certain conditions so expressly stated. The late Teodorica was under obligation to deliver the TCT to Spouses Valenzuela, and when the delivery is complied with, a Final Deed of Sale of the subject lot be executed in favor of petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. Heirs are bound to respect the contracts entered into by their predecessors-in-interest. Obligations are also transmitted to the heirs of the parties, and they may be compelled to fulfil the same. Respondents Capala were the ones who obtained the TCT on June 4, 1999. It was their obligation to deliver the TCT to Spouses Valenzuela so that the latter can pay the balance of P25,000.00 and thereafter to execute the Final Deed of Sale in the spouses’ favor.\n",
      "Finally, Spouses Valenzuela assailed the award of nominal damages for lack of legal basis and the imposition of attorney’s fees there being no bad faith on their part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Respondents’ Comment\n",
      "\n",
      "Respondents Capala averred that the arguments presented by Spouses Valenzuela are questions of fact which take it out of the scope of the present petition under Rule 45. Contrary to Spouses Valenzuela’s claim, they only learned that the lot was subject to a Contract to Buy on March 1996, then filed the complaint three years thereafter; hence, they cannot be attributed with laches. On the contrary, Spouses Valenzuela knew of this Contract to Buy for more than 20 years already. They even averred that they had paid in full the purchase price and it was the obligation of respondents Capala to comply with the terms of the Contract. If such was the case, Spouses Valenzuela should not have waited until 1999, when the case was filed, to act on their supposed right. The offer to give the rent from the subject property or buy the same if respondents Capala decide to sell it ran counter to petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s assertion that she paid the full purchase price. This leads to the conclusion that there was no payment and thus no vested right accrued to Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "Further, respondents Capala posited that the CA did not err in awarding nominal damages and attorney’s fees. Respondents Capala were unduly deprived of their ownership over the subject property for several years and despite the presence of title by respondents Capala, such was not respected by Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "The issues to be resolved are: (1) whether the CA was correct in ruling that the Contract to Buy was valid and binding, Teodorica’s signature therein being genuine; (2) whether Spouses Valenzuela failed to prove their right to remain in the subject property; consequently, they should turn over the possession thereof to respondents Capala, the successors-in-interest of Teodorica, the registered owner; and (3) whether laches had precluded the claims of Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "Ruling of the Court\n",
      "\n",
      "The petition is meritorious.\n",
      "As a general rule, We do not disturb the factual findings of the appellate court. A re-examination of factual findings cannot be done in a petition for review on certiorari because the Court is not a trier of facts but reviews only questions of law. However, this case falls under one of the recognized exceptions thereto because the factual findings of the trial court and appellate court are conflicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it noted that in their Amended Complaint, respondents Capala emphasized that their principal cause of action was to declare the Contract to Buy null and void, Teodorica’s signature therein being forged. The RTC found Teodorica’s signature as forged; hence, the contract was null and void and without any binding effect. The CA, on the other hand, made its own visual determination and found Teodorica’s signature therein as genuine; hence, the contract is valid and binding. These contrasting findings warrant a re-­examination of the facts of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preliminarily, the Court will discuss the effect of the stipulation made by the parties during the pre-trial, specifically the admission as to the existence of the execution of the Contract to Buy between the Teodorica and Brenda Valenzuela. In the original complaint filed by respondents Capala, they claim that Spouses Valenzuela should now turn over the subject property to them considering the death of Teodorica which extinguished the alleged Contract to Buy, terminating whatever rights and obligations created between the contracting parties. In the amended complaint, respondents Capala changed their principal cause of action to nullity of the Contract to Buy on the basis of forgery, asserting that Teodorica’s signature therein was forged. The contract being a nullity, Spouses Valenzuela should now turn over the possession to respondents Capala.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the pre-trial was conducted prior to the amendment of the complaint. When the motion for leave to amend complaint was granted by the RTC, no other pre-trial was conducted. The Court disagrees with the CA that the admission as the existence and due execution of the Contract to Buy stands. When respondents Capala changed their cause of action in their amended complaint to forgery, said admission no longer applies in their favor considering that it contradicts their claim as to the due execution and genuineness of the contract. Thus, said admission was vacated upon the amended of the complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "This notwithstanding, the Court finds that Teodrica’s signature in the Contract to Buy is genuine, hence, the contract is valid and binding between the parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the RTC Decision, it gave credence to the testimony of Romeo Oliva Varona, Document Examiner of the Regional Crime Laboratory Office of Region VII, Cebu City, that the signature of Teodorica appearing in the Contract to Buy is not hers. Varona testified that his comparative examination and analysis revealed 18 significant differences in letter formation, construction and other individual handwriting characteristics, and arrived at the conclusion that the questioned signature of Teodorica appearing in the subject Contract to Buy acknowledged before Notary Public Bruno A. Villamor dated December 1, 1978 and the standard signatures appearing in the three documents were written by two different persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "It bears stressing that the opinions of handwriting experts are not necessarily binding upon the court, the expert’s function being to place before the court data upon which the court can form its own opinion. This principle holds true especially when the question involved is mere handwriting similarity or dissimilarity, which can be determined by a visual comparison of specimens of the questioned signatures with those of the currently existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Gepulle-Garbo v. Sps. Garabato, the Court explained the factors involved in the examination and comparison of handwritings in this wise:\n",
      "\n",
      "The authenticity of a questioned signature cannot be determined solely upon its general characteristics, similarities or dissimilarities with the genuine signature. Dissimilarities as regards spontaneity, rhythm, pressure of the pen, loops in the strokes, signs of stops, shades, etc., that may be found between the questioned signature and the genuine one are not decisive on the question of the former’s authenticity. The result of examinations of questioned handwriting, even with the benefit of aid of experts and scientific instruments, is, at best, inconclusive. There are other factors that must be taken into consideration. The position of the writer, the condition of the surface on which the paper where the questioned signature is written is placed, his state of mind, feelings and nerves, and the kind of pen and/or paper used, play an important role on the general appearance of the signature. Unless, therefore, there is, in a given case, absolute absence, or manifest dearth, of direct or circumstantial competent evidence on the character of a questioned handwriting, much weight should not be given to characteristic similarities, or dissimilarities, between that questioned handwriting and an authentic one.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a careful and thorough examination of the records of the case, this Court affirms the findings of the CA that Teodorica’s signature in the Contract to Buy is genuine. The CA found that, after a visual examination of the sample signatures of Teodorica and her signature in the Contract to Buy, there is a striking resemblance and no distinguishing difference. While there may be slight dissimilarities, these appear to be natural and inevitable variations that may be expected even in genuine signatures made by one and the same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, this Court made the following observations in finding the signature of Teodorica in the Contract to Buy to be genuine, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Contract to Buy which was examined by Varona, the Document Examiner, is a mere photocopy. Notably, the genuineness and due execution of a photocopy could not be competently established without a copy of the original. Here, the original copy of the Contract to Buy was not even presented in court. Respondent Maria Lily Capala testified on cross that she did not ask from Atty. Bruno A. Villamor, the notary public, the original copy of the Contract to Buy, and she did not go to the Office of the Clerk of Court to get a certified true copy of the same. Since mere photocopy of the subject Contract to Buy was used to examine the questioned and standard signatures of Teodorica, no valid comparison can be had between them. Hence, Varona’s conclusion that the signature of Teodorica appearing in the Contract to Buy is not hers cannot be given due weight and credence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Varona did not make a categorical conclusion that the submitted signatures are the standard signatures of Teodorica. Standard signatures are the genuine signatures of a person for comparison purposes. Respondents Capala submitted to the document examiner the following documents for comparison: (1) Assessed Value of Property dated January 30, 1976 (Exh. “S-1”); (2) Application for New/Renewal of Mayor’s Permit to Operate a Business dated January 30, 1976 (Exh. “S-2”); and (3) Application for Registration of Business dated May 4, 1979 (Exhs. “S-3 to S-4”). In his testimony, Varona declared that he did not conduct an investigation whether the standard signatures in the documents submitted are genuine; all he did was to examine the same and concluded that the signatures were written by one and the same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the Contract to Buy is a notarized document, thus, it is considered a public document. It is a well-settled principle that a duly notarized document enjoys the prima facie presumption of authenticity and due execution, as well as the full faith and credence attached to a public instrument. To overturn this legal presumption, evidence must be clear, convincing, and more than merely preponderant to establish that there was forgery that gave rise to a spurious contract. As also borne in the records, the notary public, Atty. Bruno A. Villamor, testified in court that he prepared and notarized the Contract to Buy; that the signature appearing therein is his; and confirmed that Teodorica’s signature therein is her signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, respondents Capala are estopped to deny the contract entered into by their mother with Brenda Valenzuela. Be it noted that when their mother was still alive, she recognized/acknowledged the contract she executed with petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. Teodorica allowed Spouses Valenzuela to possess the subject property and did not object when the spouses constructed a building for their battery business and where the spouses are now residing. During her lifetime, Teodorica did not take steps to annul the contract and recover the land. Even respondents Capala admitted Spouses Valenzuela’s possession of the subject property from 1979 up to the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heirs are bound by contracts entered into by their predecessors-in-interest. As heirs of Teodorica, respondents Capala are bound by the Contract to Buy executed by their mother in favor of petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. In fact, respondents Capala knew that Spouses Valenzuela had been in possession of the subject property even during the lifetime of their mother. Their mother told them that the subject property is mortgaged to petitioner Brenda Valenzuela, however, their mother did not show any document of mortgage. Be it noted that the parties herein are all residents of Ormoc City, although from different barangays. It would be impossible for respondents Capala not to have noticed the building constructed on the subject property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the finding that the Contract to Buy is a valid and binding contract between Teodorica and Spouses Valenzuela, the CA, however, ruled that Spouses Valenzuela are not entitled to ownership of the property or the execution of the final deed of sale considering that they have not proven the payment of the balance of the full purchase price. The CA declared that petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s offer to pay the amount of P25,000.00 during the barangay conciliation and at the trial of the case ran contrary to their claim of full payment and their consequent ownership of the subject land.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Court disagrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Contract to Buy contains the following provisions:\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Party for the First Part desires to sell said parcel of land aforementioned to the Party for the Second Part for a valuable sum of Thirty Five Thousand Pesos (P35,000.00), Philippine Currency, and a token money or partial amount of which has been acknowledged in this document the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00), has been paid by the Party for the Second Part;\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Party for the Second Part is to buy the land belonging to the Party for the First Part and hereby paid the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to the Party for the First Part, as token money or earnest money acknowledged to have been received in full by the Party for the First Part;\n",
      "\n",
      "That the remaining balance of P25,000.00, shall be paid by the Party for the Second Part to the Party for the First Part, as soon as the Transfer Certificate of Title shall be delivered by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part, and when this is complied a Final Deed of Sale of this lot shall be executed by the Party for the First Part to the Party for the Second Part. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be gleaned from the provisions of the contract that Spouses Valenzuela have the obligation to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price as soon as the Transfer Certificate of Title shall have been delivered by Teodorica. As testified by petitioner Brenda Valenzuela, at the time of the execution of the Contract to Buy, the title to the subject property was still in the name of Pedro Codilla. No one was interested to buy the property because of the pending litigation involving the subject property. Hence, the above condition was imposed, i.e., that the payment of the remaining balance of P25,000.00 would be paid by petitioner Brenda Valenzuela upon delivery of the title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that the title to the property has not been delivered, Spouses Valenzuela’s obligation to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price did not arise yet. Spouses Valenzuela cannot be dispossessed from the subject property since the happening of the condition to pay the full purchase price did not take place yet. Records show that after Teodorica obtained a favorable judgment in the civil case (specific performance of contract) against Esmeralda T. Madjus, Teodorica never attempted to have the title transferred in her name. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela kept on reminding Teodorica but the latter told her to wait because Teodorica was so sickly and asking for consideration of her physical health, until her death in November 1, 1982.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears that the TCT in the name of Teodorica Capala was obtained by respondents Capala and it was issued only in June 4, 1999. Respondents Capala filed the complaint in August 3, 1999. Contrary to the CA ruling, Spouses Valenzuela cannot be guilty of laches to assert their rights over the subject property, as a counterclaim in their Answer, since it was only in 1999 that the TCT to the property was issued in the name of Teodorica.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, Spouses Valenzuela claims that they had fully paid the remaining balance of P25,000.00 and what remains is the delivery of the title to them and the execution of the Final Deed of Sale in their favor. In her testimony, petitioner Brenda Valenzuela declared that she was instructed by Teodorica to pay her loan with the Rural Bank of Ormoc City in the amount of P17,000.00 while the remaining amount of P10,000.00 was given to Teodorica for the education of her children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laches is defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time to do that which, by observance of due diligence, could or should have been done earlier. It is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert his right either has abandoned or declined to assert it. In order to constitute laches, the following must be present: (a) conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation complained of; (b) delay in asserting complainant’s rights after he had knowledge of defendant’s acts and after he has had the opportunity to sue; (c) lack of knowledge or notice by defendant that the complainant will assert the right on which he bases his suit; and (d) injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event the relief is accorded to the complainant.\n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed above, Spouses Valenzuela took actual possession of the land after the execution of the Contract to Buy in 1978. They even constructed a building for their battery business and where the spouses are now residing. Teodorica did not object thereto, thereby acknowledging the contract she entered into with petitioner Brenda Valenzuela. As provided for in the contract, the obligation to deliver the title to the property belongs to Teodorica. Spouses Valenzuela had no obligation to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price absent the delivery of the title. Be it noted that it was only in June 4, 1999 that the TCT to the property was issued in the name of Teodorica. The complaint was filed by respondents Capala in August 3, 1999. By way of counterclaim in their Answer, Spouses Valenzuela immediately asserted their right to have the title delivered to them considering the issuance of the TCT in the name of Teodorica. While Spouses Valenzuela contended they have paid the balance of P25,000.00, they are still ready and willing to pay the balance if the payment made would not be credited, provided that respondents Capala shall deliver the TCT and execute a Final Deed of Sale in their favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foregoing considered, it cannot be said that Spouses Valenzuela have already abandoned or declined to assert their right. Without delay, they immediately insisted on their right over the TCT on the same year it was issued. Having possessed and enjoyed the property for more than 20 years, Spouses Valenzuela did not expect that the heirs of Teodorica would still attempt to recover the property from them. Indeed, Spouses Valenzuela, who already spent for the improvement of the subject property, would be prejudiced if respondents Capala will be allowed to recover the possession of the subject property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela’s offer to pay the amount of P25,000.00 during the barangay conciliation and at the trial of the case does not run counter to their claim of full payment. Petitioner Brenda Valenzuela only made an offer of compromise during the barangay conciliation, which was not accepted by respondents Capala.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general rule is an offer of compromise in a civil case is not an admission of liability. It is not admissible in evidence against the offeror. The rule, however, is not iron-clad. This much was elucidated by this Court in Trans-Pacific Industrial Supplies, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, to wit:\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the admissibility or non-admissibility of an offer to compromise, the circumstances of the case and the intent of the party making the offer should be considered. Thus, if a party denies the existence of a debt but offers to pay the same for the purpose of buying peace and avoiding litigation, the offer of settlement is inadmissible. If in the course thereof, the party making the offer admits the existence of an indebtedness combined with a proposal to settle the claim amicably, then, the admission is admissible to prove such indebtedness x x x. Indeed, an offer of settlement is an effective admission of a borrower’s loan balance x x x. (Emphasis supplied)\n",
      "\n",
      "Applying the foregoing to this case, Spouses Valenzuela’s assertion that they had fully paid the purchase price yet offered to give the monthly rentals of LG Gas to respondents Capala is not an admission of liability. It is not an admission that they have not fully paid the purchase price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spouses Valenzuela cannot be considered yet as the owner of the subject property, as prayed for in their counterclaim and in this petition. Ownership of the subject property has not been transferred to them despite delivery of the subject property. In a contract to sell, such as the subject Contract to Buy, the absence of a formal deed of conveyance is a strong indication that the parties did not intend immediate transfer of ownership, but only a transfer after full payment of the purchase price. The need to execute a deed of absolute sale upon completion of payment of the price generally indicates that it is a contract to sell, as it implies the reservation of title in the vendor until the vendee has completed the payment of the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the finding that the Contract to Buy is valid, it is but just and proper that its provisions be now enforced. The heirs of Teodorica, herein respondents Capala, are directed to deliver the TCT to Spouses Valenzuela. Since they are still willing to pay the remaining balance despite their claim of full payment, Spouses Valenzuela are likewise ordered to pay the amount of P25,000.00 to the heirs of Teodorica. Thereafter, a Final Deed of Sale shall be executed by the heirs of Teodorica in favor of Spouses Valenzuela.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Decision dated June 13, 2018 and the Resolution dated March 6, 2019 of the Court of Appeals of Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 04363 are AFFIRMED only in so far as the Contract to Buy dated December 1, 1978 is declared valid; the rest of the Decision is SET ASIDE. The Court hereby makes the following pronouncements:\n",
      "\n",
      "Respondents are directed to deliver Transfer Certificate of Title No. 34880 in the name of Teodorica Capala to petitioners.\n",
      "Petitioners are directed to pay the amount of P25,000.00 in favor of respondents as payment of the balance of the purchase price of the subject property.\n",
