FACTS:
This case is about the proof required to establish the domicile of a reinstated Filipino citizen who seeks election as governor of a province.The Facts and the Case
The sole issue presented in this case is whether or not the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in ruling that Jalosjos failed to present ample proof of a bona fide intention to establish his domicile in Ipil Zamboanga Sibugay.The Court s Ruling

ISSUES:
The Local Government Code requires a candidate seeking the position of provincial governor to be a resident of the province for at least one year before the election. For purposes of the election laws the requirement of residence is synonymous with domicile meaning that a person must not only intend to reside in a particular place but must also have personal presence in such place coupled with conduct indicative of such intention.There is no hard and fast rule to determine a candidate s compliance with residency requirement since the question of residence is a question of intention.

RULINGS:
Petitioner Rommel Jalosjos was born in Quezon City on October 26 1973. He migrated to Australia in 1981 when he was eight years old and there acquired Australian citizenship.
