    "#     This program processes a raw court case text file and summarizes it by\n",
    "#     segmenting the text into facts, issues, and rulings using a finetuned\n",
    "#     model and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It provides a structured summary\n",
    "#     in the output format of facts, issues, and rulings.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#     The program is designed to assist in automating the summarization of legal\n",

    "# Where the program fits in the general system design:\n",
    "#     The program is a component in a larger system for automating the extraction\n",

Indeed case law instructs that i t is a more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on appeal rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause a grave injustice to the parties giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay if not miscarriage of justice. What should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life liberty honor or property on technicalities. Corollarily the rule which states that the mistakes of counsel bind the client may not be strictly followed where observance of it would result in the outright deprivation of the client liberty or property or where the interest of justice so requires.\n",

Ruiz who as narrated earlier failed to file the required appellant brief despite repeatedly moving for extension of time to do so. Such unjustified omission led to petitioner conviction becoming final and executory without appellate review and must be dealt with accordingly. Therefore in accordance with Section 13 Rule 139-B of the Rules the Court finds it proper to furnish the Office of the Bar Confidant a copy of this Decision for the initiation of appropriate disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Ruiz.\n",
