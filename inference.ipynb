    "established by lone witness Emma Rival. She testified that on October 19, 1989, at around 11:45 p.m., she took a\n",
    "brief respite from her work as a singer of El Gusto Restaurant and Folk House\n",
    "at Aparri, Cagayan and went to buy merienda at Lansi’s Store located adjacent\n",
    "to said restaurant. On her way back to\n",
    "El Gusto, while she was about three steps away, she saw accused Venancio\n",
    "Mercado, Jr. stab Remely Padios, a security guard of said establishment, with a\n",
    "weapon that looked like a fan knife. Afterwards, Mercado gave said weapon to appellant Rivera who then\n",
    "stabbed Remely Padios two times, prompting the latter to draw his gun. Rivera pushed Padios causing him to fall\n",
    "down and drop his gun. Mercado and\n",
    "Rivera then ran away from the area. When Emma Rival went near the victim, the latter asked her to look for\n",
    "his gun, which she found underneath the security guard’s table. She gave said gun to the manager of the\n",
    "restaurant, Mila Talosig, and both of them, together with a waiter of said\n",
    "restaurant, brought the victim to the Lyceum of Aparri Hospital.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectedly, the defense gave an entirely different version of the\n",
    "incident. Appellant Rivera took the\n",
    "witness stand and testified that at about 11:00 p.m. of October 19, 1989, he\n",
    "and Mercado were at El Gusto Restaurant having a few drinks. Rivera decided to request Emma Rival, the\n",
    "lady singer of said establishment, to sing a particular song. Rivera approached the stage, which was about\n",
    "two feet high, and whispered the title of the song to the singer. Rivera, however, was “outbalanced”\n",
    "and his face accidentally touched Rival’s face, prompting the latter to slap\n",
    "him. Padios, the security guard of El\n",
    "Gusto, grabbed Rivera’s collar and dragged him out of the restaurant. Padios then pushed him and drew his\n",
    "gun. While Rivera was trying to stand\n",
    "up, Padios pointed his gun at him. Fearing for his life, Rivera “unconsciously” drew his knife\n",
    "and held the hand of Padios which was then holding a firearm. They grappled and when Rivera saw that\n",
    "Padios was about to fall, he released his grip and ran away.[5]\n",

    "In this appeal, appellant assigns two errors supposedly committed\n",
    "by the court a quo which can, however, be subsumed into a single\n",
    "supposed error, that is, that the trial court erred in not giving weight and\n",
    "probative value to his testimony and convicting him as a consequence.[6]\n",
    "He also calls the attention of the Court to the fact that Judge Efren N.\n",
    "Ambrosio, who rendered the questioned decision, took over the trial of the case\n",
    "only after the prosecution witnesses had already testified. Appellant asserts that Judge Felipe R.\n",
    "Tumacder, who originally presided over the case, thereafter retired prior to\n",
    "the termination of the case, hence the judge who penned the decision had no\n",
    "opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses nor to note the\n",
    "evasiveness of their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Said contention does not persuade. While it is true that the trial judge who conducted the hearing\n",
    "could possibly be in a better position to ascertain the truth or the falsity of\n",
    "the testimonies of the witnesses, it does not necessarily follow that a judge\n",
    "who was not present during a part of the trial can not render a valid and just\n",
    "decision, since the latter can also rely on the transcribed stenographic notes\n",
    "taken during the trial as the basis of his decision.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no dispute that on the night of October 19, 1989, Remely\n",
    "Padios died of stab wounds inflicted by Mario Rivera. This has been admitted by the latter. In view of such admission, the Court shall focus its analysis and\n",
    "evaluation of the case on whether or not the appellant had presented cogent,\n",
    "persuasive and compelling evidence to prove his claim that he acted under the\n",
    "justifying circumstance of self-defense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going to the basics, we need merely note that the three\n",
    "requisites of self-defense are unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of the\n",
    "means employed to prevent or repel it, and lack of sufficient provocation on\n",
    "the part of the person defending himself.[8]\n",
    "We have consistently stressed that an accused who interposes self-defense must\n",
    "prove every element of this defense in order to avoid criminal liability for\n",
    "the killing or injury of the victim,[9]\n",
    "and he must rely on the strength of his own defense and not on the weakness of\n",
    "the evidence for the prosecution for, even if the latter’s evidence is weak, it\n",
    "cannot be disbelieved after the accused himself admitted the killing.[10]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pursuing his theory of self-defense, appellant tried to show that\n",
    "the deceased victim “pushed him” and “suddenly aimed his gun at\n",
    "(him).” Fearing for his life, so he claims, he “unconsciously drew\n",
    "(his) knife” and “thrust it at him.” Appellant further testified that after stabbing the deceased once, he\n",
    "fled from the scene.[11]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The testimony of appellant on how he supposedly stabbed the\n",
    "victim runs counter to the physical evidence in the case, as reflected in the\n",
    "medico-legal report. The medico­-legal\n",
    "certificate, issued by the Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital with Dr. Errol\n",
    "Jesus de Yro as the attending physician, reveals that the victim suffered two\n",
    "(2) stab wounds: the first, “5\n",
    "cms., 5th ICS line, (R) parasternal line,” and the second, “5 cms.,\n",
    "(L) lumbar area w/ omental evisceration.”[12]\n",
    "Dr. Romulo A. de Rivera, interpreting said certificate because of the\n",
    "unavailability of the attending physician, testified that the entry of the\n",
    "first wound was on the fifth right breastbone while that of the second wound\n",
    "was on the left lumbar area, left side of the back.[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Dr. De Rivera testified that when the second wound\n",
    "was inflicted, the assailant was behind the victim. Either wound, both lethal, could have caused the death of the\n",
    "victim.[14]\n",
    "It will also be noted that appellant did not suffer any injury, although the\n",
    "victim was taller, had a bigger build[15]\n",
    "and was allegedly already aiming his gun at appellant before said victim was\n",
    "stabbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, the number of wounds, the point of entry of\n",
    "the second wound, the position of the victim in relation to the assailant when\n",
    "the second wound was inflicted, as well as the fact that appellant did not\n",
    "sustain any injury, conjointly belie any pretension of self-defense. The nature and the number of wounds\n",
    "inflicted by an assailant are constantly and unremittingly considered important\n",
    "incidents which disprove a plea of self-defense.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "Appellant tried to demonstrate that his acts were purely in\n",
    "legitimate self-defense by citing the testimony of prosecution witness Emma\n",
    "Rival which appellant claims corroborates his testimony that indeed there was\n",
    "unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased Padios.[17]\n",
    "Said attribution of appellant, however, is not only misleading but a gross\n",
    "distortion by truncation of the testimony of said witness. What appellant quotes in his brief starts\n",
    "with the portion where the witness said that the victim drew his gun after he\n",
    "was pushed by Rivera. Deliberately\n",
    "omitted was the preceding portion of her testimony where she clearly explained\n",
    "that, prior thereto, she saw both accused attacking the victim, before he drew\n",
    "his gun, to wit:\n",

    "\n",
    "“Q:  What\n",
    "did Remely Padios do, being stabbed by the two accused namely Mario Rivera and\n",
    "Venancio Mercado, Jr.?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   He took his gun, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  What did the two accused\n",
    "do after stabbing Remely Padios?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   They ran away, sir.\n",

    "Q:  And what was the position\n",
    "of Remely Padios when he tried to unseath (sic) or withdraw (sic) his firearm?\n",

    "Remely Padios after he was pushed by Mario Rivera?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   He fell, sir.”[18]\n",
    "\n",
    "If appellant honestly believed that his acts consisted of\n",
    "self-defense against the unlawful aggression of the victim, instead of\n",
    "immediately running away after stabbing the latter, he could and should have\n",
    "informed the people inside the restaurant of what had just transpired and\n",
    "sought aid for himself and Padios. For\n",
    "that matter, he should also have reported the incident to the police, instead\n",
    "of escaping and avoiding the authorities until he was arrested. His actuations cannot but put his case\n",
    "within the ambit of our jurisprudential doctrine that the flight of an accused\n",
    "discloses a guilty conscience.[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "Appellant further declared that he saw Mercado “in our\n",
    "place” after the incident but they did not talk to each other nor did he\n",
    "inform Mercado that he stabbed the security guard.[20]\n",
    "Said representation of appellant, if true, is perplexing and abnormal. Surely, what had taken place was not a mere\n",
    "ordinary occurrence that one would easily forget or neglect to mention. On the other hand, Mercado would at least have\n",
    "made inquiries as to what had actually happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the foregoing, neither can appellant hope for mileage\n",
    "from the testimony of Mercado on which he relies for corroboration. Mercado declared that although he saw the\n",
    "victim “pull” appellant away and that the latter was brought out of\n",
    "the restaurant, he (Mercado) did not do anything but he just proceeded to drink\n",
    "his beer. Mercado further narrated that\n",
    "after paying the bill, he went out and saw the victim aiming his gun at\n",
    "appellant, prompting the latter to “box” the deceased. Still, he did not do anything and opted\n",
    "rather to return inside the restaurant where he sat down and, after the\n",
    "incident, he went home.[21]\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard, to believe that although the deceased was supposedly\n",
    "aiming his gun at appellant in the presence of Mercado, this witness took no\n",
    "action whatsoever. The Court\n",
    "understands the postulated hesitancy of Mercado not to get involved in any\n",
    "altercation, considering that he is a recidivist. But the Court is baffled why he did not at the very least report\n",
    "that fact to or seek assistance from the people inside the restaurant if he\n",
    "really saw the security guard pointing a gun at appellant Rivera who is his\n",
    "childhood friend and neighbor.[22]\n",
    "We have perforce to recall the rule that evidence to be believed must not only\n",
    "proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself,[23]\n",
    "and reject these blatant prevarications of Mercado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the prosecution’s case rested mainly on the testimony of\n",
    "Emma Rival, the Court finds no reason not to favorably entertain her testimony\n",
    "on the particulars regarding the assault of appellant himself against the\n",
    "victim. Our review of the records\n",
    "confirms the trial court’s observation that witness Rival testified in a\n",
    "straightforward manner and withstood the rigors of cross-examination. Any flaws in her testimony on other aspects\n",
    "of the incident are minor errors ascribable to inaccuracy in her observation or\n",
    "perception of rapidly moving events, rather than to an intent to fabricate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appellant failed to establish any dubious motive on the part of\n",
    "witness Rival as to why she would give a fictional testimony against\n",
    "appellant. Indubitably, said witness,\n",
    "being a co-employee of victim Padios, would have more reason than any ordinary\n",
    "witness to make sure that the real killer of her co-worker be brought to\n",
    "justice. Absent the most compelling\n",
    "reason or motive, it is inconceivable why witness Rival would openly and\n",
    "publicly lie or concoct a story which would send an innocent man to jail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration that sustains the position of the\n",
    "prosecution and derails the proposition of the defense is the fact that any\n",
    "motive for the encounter lies on the part of appellant. Rival testified that, prior to the incident,\n",
    "appellant Rivera and Mercado had created trouble by breaking bottles inside the\n",
    "restaurant. The victim chided the two\n",
    "for creating trouble and brought them out of the establishment, as it was his\n",
    "duty to do so.[24]\n",
    "Resenting the fact that they were admonished and ejected from the premises, it\n",
    "is not hard to conclude that both accused had the ill-conceived reason to take\n",
    "offense and recourse against the victim. Consequently, and on the foregoing considerations, appellant’s theory of\n",
    "self-defense must be completely rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information in the present case specifies evident\n",
    "premeditation and treachery as qualifying circumstances. However, we agree with appellant that\n",
    "evident premeditation may not be appreciated against him. The prosecution failed to present sufficient\n",
    "evidence as to how and when the plan to neutralize the victim was conceived or\n",
    "what time elapsed before it was carried out. Evident premeditation cannot be appreciated in the absence of direct\n",
    "evidence of the planning and the preparation to kill,[25]\n",
    "and that the execution of the criminal act was preceded by cool thought and\n",
    "reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space\n",
    "of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.[26]\n",
    "\n",
    "We are likewise not inclined to hold that there was treachery in\n",
    "the killing of the victim. We are not\n",
    "unaware of rulings to the effect that even if the attack is frontal, as in this\n",
    "case, but the suddenness thereof rendered it impossible for the victim to make\n",
    "a defense or to escape, alevosia may nevertheless be appreciated. It is to be conceded, however, that such\n",
    "doctrinal pronouncements necessarily envision that each case must be judged in\n",
    "light of the attendant factual milieu thereof and, more importantly, under the\n",
    "overall concept and rationale for treachery which, if considered as a\n",
    "qualifying circumstance, would change the nature of the unlawful killing and\n",
    "call for the imposition of the highest penalty under the law.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trial court considered the killing of the victim as\n",
    "treacherous on the theory that the accused employed a manner of execution which\n",
    "ensured the offenders’ safety from any defense or retaliatory act of the victim\n",
    "and that such mode of execution was deliberately or consciously chosen by\n",
    "them. It draws for its conclusion upon\n",
    "the following statements of prosecution witness Emma Rival:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Q:  How\n",
    "come that you saw the stabbing incident?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   When I returned back\n",
    "(sic) at El Gusto, I thought they were making a sign to ‘APPEAR’ (clapping of\n",
    "hands together) then, I noticed that they were already stabbing him, sir.”[27]\n",
    "\n",
    "which she amplified on cross-examination\n",
    "in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Q:  Who\n",
    "were making the sign of appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   Venancio Mercado and\n",
    "Mario Rivera, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  What about the deceased?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   No, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  What did these two do?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   They stabbed him, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  When they were making\n",
    "(the) sign of appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   When they were in the\n",
    "act of making the sign of appear, they suddenly stab(bed) him, sir.[28]\n",
    "\n",
    "It would, at first impression, imply that appellant and his\n",
    "co-accused resorted to their ploy of making the “appear” sign to\n",
    "delude the victim into thinking that their intentions in talking to him were\n",
    "peaceful so that they could catch him unaware and vulnerable to an unexpected\n",
    "attack. This may have been their\n",
    "purpose but, although they did succeed in fatally stabbing the victim, it would\n",
    "be too simplistic to forthwith conclude that there was treachery without\n",
    "considering the legal implications of the facts antecedent to this charade of\n",
    "appellant and his co-accused.\n",
    "\n",
    "As earlier stated, while the two accused were still inside the\n",
    "restaurant they started creating trouble by breaking bottles, such that the\n",
    "victim had to forcibly escort them out of the place.[29]\n",
    "When witness Emma Rival went to buy her merienda at Lansi’s Store much later,\n",
    "she saw Rivera there while Mercado was with the victim at the guard post, and\n",
    "they were obviously joined thereafter by Rivera.[30]\n",
    "When Rival later left the store to return to El Gusto, these were what she\n",
    "witnessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Q:  How\n",
    "far were these two accused from Remely Padios when they were making the sign of\n",
    "appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   They called Remely\n",
    "Padios outside, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  I am asking where were\n",
    "these two accused (sic) from Remely Padios when they were making the sign of\n",
    "appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   They were facing each\n",
    "other, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  And this Remely Padios\n",
    "was with a firearm?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   Yes, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q:  You mean to say that it\n",
    "was not drawn?\n",
    "\n",
    "A:   It was intact in his\n",
    "waist, sir.”[31]\n",
    "\n",
    "From the foregoing facts, we can readily deduce that the victim\n",
    "was not completely unaware that herein appellant and Mercado posed a danger to\n",
    "him and which necessarily put him on his guard. He had forced them out of the restaurant and he was aware of\n",
    "their capacity and disposition to make trouble despite his presence therein as\n",
    "a security guard. Instead of going\n",
    "home, they loitered in the premises and later called him outside. He would be naive to believe that their\n",
    "intentions were anything but hostile considering their resentment and\n",
    "humiliation after being publicly required to leave the restaurant with the\n",
    "knowledge of other customers. In fact,\n",
    "when they were making the “appear” sign, the victim did not join them\n",
    "in the act. Also, we must not lose\n",
    "sight of the fact that the victim was duly armed with a .38 caliber revolver\n",
    "which is more than sufficient as a means of defense against a knife and that,\n",
    "as a security guard, he was trained not only to detect but also to anticipate\n",
    "the presence of danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to doctrines of earlier vintage but which are still\n",
    "consistently followed as authoritative precedents, we are reminded that\n",
    "treachery is not to be presumed, but must be proved as conclusively as the act\n",
    "it qualifies.[32]\n",
    "The same degree of proof to dispel any reasonable doubt is required before\n",
    "treachery may be considered either as an aggravating or qualifying\n",
    "circumstance.[33]\n",
    "Further, it has long been declared that the qualifying circumstance of\n",
    "treachery must be based on some positive conclusive proof and not only upon\n",
    "hypothetical facts[34]\n",
    "or on mere suppositions or presumptions.[35]\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, paragraph 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code itself\n",
    "requires that the means, methods and forms employed, in order to constitute\n",
    "treachery, must have been directly and specially sought, adopted or used to\n",
    "insure both the accomplishment of the criminal design and its\n",
    "execution with impunity or without risk to the offender.[36]\n",
    "Thus, in U.S. vs. Namit,[37]\n",
    "it was held that where the aggressor failed to adopt a mode of attack intended\n",
    "to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself, the\n",
    "circumstance that the attack was sudden and unexpected by the person attacked\n",
    "did not constitute the element of alevosia necessary to raise homicide\n",
    "to murder. Where it was not established\n",
    "that the defendant in killing the deceased employed any means by which all\n",
    "defenses on the part of the latter should be impossible, there is no sufficient\n",
    "ground to establish alevosia and the killing should be classified as\n",
    "homicide.[38]\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, in light of the foregoing statutory and\n",
    "jurisprudential guideposts, we cannot conclude that the accused acted with\n",
    "treachery since the means they employed did not eliminate all risks to\n",
    "themselves. As in the aforecited case\n",
    "of Asilo, the victim was not taken entirely unaware by the assault\n",
    "against him. Being adequately armed,\n",
    "neither can it be said that all means of defense on his part were impossible. Here, by the exercise of a reasonable degree\n",
    "of anticipatory caution and vigilance, the victim either could or should have\n",
    "been able to defend himself since he had all the opportunity to do so, and he\n",
    "could have prepared for or anticipated the attack. We, therefore, hold that under the foregoing disquisition and\n",
    "considering that doubts are resolved in favor of the accused since criminal\n",
    "justice inclines in appropriate cases to the milder form of liability, the\n",
    "crime was not attended by alevosia and should be considered as simple\n",
    "homicide without any modifying circumstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby MODIFIED\n",
    "by convicting the accused of the crime of homicide instead of murder, and\n",
    "imposing upon him an indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of prision\n",
    "mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion\n",
    "temporal, as maximum. In all\n",
