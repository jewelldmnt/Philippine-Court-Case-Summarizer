Program Title: Court Case Summarizer
Programmers: Nicholas Dela Torre

Purpose:
    This HTML file serves as the entry point for the Court Case Summarizer
    application, a web-based platform designed to help legal professionals
    quickly review and summarize complex court cases. The application uses
    Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to extract and summarize key sections
    (facts, issues, and rulings) of legal documents for efficient
    information retrieval.

Where the program fits in the general system design:
    The index.html file is the base structure of the web interface,
    linking the root JavaScript modules and defining the main content
    container for React components. It provides essential metadata for
    responsive design and establishes the favicon representing the
    application's Philippine legal focus.

Dependencies and Resources:
    - **favicon**: A Philippine flag icon to visually represent the focus
      on Philippine court cases.
    - **React Module**: The main JavaScript file (main.jsx) loads and
      renders the React components within the "root" div.
    - **Viewport Meta Tag**: Ensures a responsive layout across various
      devices, optimizing the web application for mobile and desktop users.

Control:
    The HTML structure is static, with the main content dynamically rendered
    by React components in main.jsx upon application load.
