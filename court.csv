[ G.R. No. 101798. ]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. MARIO RIVERA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
DECISION

An evening intended to be a relaxing night out between two friends,
herein accused-appellant Mario Rivera and his erstwhile co-accused Venancio
Mercado, Jr., provided a tragic tableau for the senseless killing of an
unwitting victim and the conviction of appellant for murder. The case did not even have the saving grace
of the inscrutability of fate; it was but another mundane episode involving the
admixture of bravado and alcohol.


Appellant Mario Rivera and Venancio Mercado, Jr. were charged
before the Regional Trial Court, Branch VIII at Aparri, Cagayan, with the crime
of murder in an information alleging the commission thereof as follows:

“That on or about October 19, 1989 in the municipality of
Aparri, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the said accused, Mario Rivera and Venancio Mercado, Jr., armed with a
sharp pointed instrument, conspiring together and helping each other, with
intent to kill, with evident premeditation and with treachery, did then and
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and stab one Remely
Padios, inflicting upon him wounds on his body which caused his death.

That the accused Venancio Mercado, Jr. is a recidivist, he having
been previously convicted by final judgment of Homicide in June, 1987, by this
Honorable Court (Regional Trial Court, Aparri), Branch IX, in Criminal Case No.
IX-498, entitled ‘People of the Philippines versus Venancio Mercado, Jr.’ for
Homicide, which crime is embraced in the same title of the Revised Penal
Code.”[1]

Both accused were arrested and, when arraigned, entered a plea of
not guilty. After due trial, the lower
court found both accused guilty as charged and sentenced them to suffer the
penalty of reclusion perpetua, with all the accessory penalties
provided by law. They were likewise
ordered to pay jointly and severally to the heirs of the deceased the sum of
(1) P50,000.00 by way of death indemnity; (2) P17,128.00 for actual funeral and
other incidental expenses; (3) P20,000.00 by way of moral damages; and (4)
P15,000.00 by way of exemplary damages, for a grand total of P102,128.00,
without sub­sidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. The court further declared that, in the
service of their sentence, they were entitled to full credit for the period of
their preventive imprisonment, provided they had complied with the requirements
of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.[2]


A motion for reconsideration was filed by accused Venancio
Mercado, Jr., while accused Mario Rivera filed a notice of appeal. The court a quo, in an amended
decision dated July 15, 1991, acquitted Venancio Mercado, Jr. on the basis of
reasonable doubt since appellant Rivera admitted sole liability for the killing
and denied Mercado’s participation therein.[3]
The subject decision convicting herein appellant is now the subject of our
appellate review.

The principal facts of the case for the prosecution were
established by lone witness Emma Rival. She testified that on October 19, 1989, at around 11:45 p.m., she took a
brief respite from her work as a singer of El Gusto Restaurant and Folk House
at Aparri, Cagayan and went to buy merienda at Lansi’s Store located adjacent
to said restaurant. On her way back to
El Gusto, while she was about three steps away, she saw accused Venancio
Mercado, Jr. stab Remely Padios, a security guard of said establishment, with a
weapon that looked like a fan knife. Afterwards, Mercado gave said weapon to appellant Rivera who then
stabbed Remely Padios two times, prompting the latter to draw his gun. Rivera pushed Padios causing him to fall
down and drop his gun. Mercado and
Rivera then ran away from the area. When Emma Rival went near the victim, the latter asked her to look for
his gun, which she found underneath the security guard’s table. She gave said gun to the manager of the
restaurant, Mila Talosig, and both of them, together with a waiter of said
restaurant, brought the victim to the Lyceum of Aparri Hospital.[4]

Expectedly, the defense gave an entirely different version of the
incident. Appellant Rivera took the
witness stand and testified that at about 11:00 p.m. of October 19, 1989, he
and Mercado were at El Gusto Restaurant having a few drinks. Rivera decided to request Emma Rival, the
lady singer of said establishment, to sing a particular song. Rivera approached the stage, which was about
two feet high, and whispered the title of the song to the singer. Rivera, however, was “outbalanced”
and his face accidentally touched Rival’s face, prompting the latter to slap
him. Padios, the security guard of El
Gusto, grabbed Rivera’s collar and dragged him out of the restaurant. Padios then pushed him and drew his
gun. While Rivera was trying to stand
up, Padios pointed his gun at him. Fearing for his life, Rivera “unconsciously” drew his knife
and held the hand of Padios which was then holding a firearm. They grappled and when Rivera saw that
Padios was about to fall, he released his grip and ran away.[5]


In this appeal, appellant assigns two errors supposedly committed
by the court a quo which can, however, be subsumed into a single
supposed error, that is, that the trial court erred in not giving weight and
probative value to his testimony and convicting him as a consequence.[6]
He also calls the attention of the Court to the fact that Judge Efren N.
Ambrosio, who rendered the questioned decision, took over the trial of the case
only after the prosecution witnesses had already testified. Appellant asserts that Judge Felipe R.
Tumacder, who originally presided over the case, thereafter retired prior to
the termination of the case, hence the judge who penned the decision had no
opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses nor to note the
evasiveness of their answers.

Said contention does not persuade. While it is true that the trial judge who conducted the hearing
could possibly be in a better position to ascertain the truth or the falsity of
the testimonies of the witnesses, it does not necessarily follow that a judge
who was not present during a part of the trial can not render a valid and just
decision, since the latter can also rely on the transcribed stenographic notes
taken during the trial as the basis of his decision.[7]

There is no dispute that on the night of October 19, 1989, Remely
Padios died of stab wounds inflicted by Mario Rivera. This has been admitted by the latter. In view of such admission, the Court shall focus its analysis and
evaluation of the case on whether or not the appellant had presented cogent,
persuasive and compelling evidence to prove his claim that he acted under the
justifying circumstance of self-defense.

Going to the basics, we need merely note that the three
requisites of self-defense are unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of the
means employed to prevent or repel it, and lack of sufficient provocation on
the part of the person defending himself.[8]
We have consistently stressed that an accused who interposes self-defense must
prove every element of this defense in order to avoid criminal liability for
the killing or injury of the victim,[9]
and he must rely on the strength of his own defense and not on the weakness of
the evidence for the prosecution for, even if the latter’s evidence is weak, it
cannot be disbelieved after the accused himself admitted the killing.[10]

Pursuing his theory of self-defense, appellant tried to show that
the deceased victim “pushed him” and “suddenly aimed his gun at
(him).” Fearing for his life, so he claims, he “unconsciously drew
(his) knife” and “thrust it at him.” Appellant further testified that after stabbing the deceased once, he
fled from the scene.[11]


The testimony of appellant on how he supposedly stabbed the
victim runs counter to the physical evidence in the case, as reflected in the
medico-legal report. The medico­-legal
certificate, issued by the Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital with Dr. Errol
Jesus de Yro as the attending physician, reveals that the victim suffered two
(2) stab wounds: the first, “5
cms., 5th ICS line, (R) parasternal line,” and the second, “5 cms.,
(L) lumbar area w/ omental evisceration.”[12]
Dr. Romulo A. de Rivera, interpreting said certificate because of the
unavailability of the attending physician, testified that the entry of the
first wound was on the fifth right breastbone while that of the second wound
was on the left lumbar area, left side of the back.[13]

In addition, Dr. De Rivera testified that when the second wound
was inflicted, the assailant was behind the victim. Either wound, both lethal, could have caused the death of the
victim.[14]
It will also be noted that appellant did not suffer any injury, although the
victim was taller, had a bigger build[15]
and was allegedly already aiming his gun at appellant before said victim was
stabbed.

In the present case, the number of wounds, the point of entry of
the second wound, the position of the victim in relation to the assailant when
the second wound was inflicted, as well as the fact that appellant did not
sustain any injury, conjointly belie any pretension of self-defense. The nature and the number of wounds
inflicted by an assailant are constantly and unremittingly considered important
incidents which disprove a plea of self-defense.[16]

Appellant tried to demonstrate that his acts were purely in
legitimate self-defense by citing the testimony of prosecution witness Emma
Rival which appellant claims corroborates his testimony that indeed there was
unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased Padios.[17]
Said attribution of appellant, however, is not only misleading but a gross
distortion by truncation of the testimony of said witness. What appellant quotes in his brief starts
with the portion where the witness said that the victim drew his gun after he
was pushed by Rivera. Deliberately
omitted was the preceding portion of her testimony where she clearly explained
that, prior thereto, she saw both accused attacking the victim, before he drew
his gun, to wit:


“Q:  What
did Remely Padios do, being stabbed by the two accused namely Mario Rivera and
Venancio Mercado, Jr.?

A:   He took his gun, sir.

Q:  What did the two accused
do after stabbing Remely Padios?

A:   They ran away, sir.

Q:  And what was the position
of Remely Padios when he tried to unseath (sic) or withdraw (sic) his firearm?

A:   They pushed him, sir.

Q:  Who pushed him?

A:   Mario Rivera, sir.

Q:  And what happened to
Remely Padios after he was pushed by Mario Rivera?

A:   He fell, sir.”[18]

If appellant honestly believed that his acts consisted of
self-defense against the unlawful aggression of the victim, instead of
immediately running away after stabbing the latter, he could and should have
informed the people inside the restaurant of what had just transpired and
sought aid for himself and Padios. For
that matter, he should also have reported the incident to the police, instead
of escaping and avoiding the authorities until he was arrested. His actuations cannot but put his case
within the ambit of our jurisprudential doctrine that the flight of an accused
discloses a guilty conscience.[19]

Appellant further declared that he saw Mercado “in our
place” after the incident but they did not talk to each other nor did he
inform Mercado that he stabbed the security guard.[20]
Said representation of appellant, if true, is perplexing and abnormal. Surely, what had taken place was not a mere
ordinary occurrence that one would easily forget or neglect to mention. On the other hand, Mercado would at least have
made inquiries as to what had actually happened.


Aside from the foregoing, neither can appellant hope for mileage
from the testimony of Mercado on which he relies for corroboration. Mercado declared that although he saw the
victim “pull” appellant away and that the latter was brought out of
the restaurant, he (Mercado) did not do anything but he just proceeded to drink
his beer. Mercado further narrated that
after paying the bill, he went out and saw the victim aiming his gun at
appellant, prompting the latter to “box” the deceased. Still, he did not do anything and opted
rather to return inside the restaurant where he sat down and, after the
incident, he went home.[21]

It is hard, to believe that although the deceased was supposedly
aiming his gun at appellant in the presence of Mercado, this witness took no
action whatsoever. The Court
understands the postulated hesitancy of Mercado not to get involved in any
altercation, considering that he is a recidivist. But the Court is baffled why he did not at the very least report
that fact to or seek assistance from the people inside the restaurant if he
really saw the security guard pointing a gun at appellant Rivera who is his
childhood friend and neighbor.[22]
We have perforce to recall the rule that evidence to be believed must not only
proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself,[23]
and reject these blatant prevarications of Mercado.

Although the prosecution’s case rested mainly on the testimony of
Emma Rival, the Court finds no reason not to favorably entertain her testimony
on the particulars regarding the assault of appellant himself against the
victim. Our review of the records
confirms the trial court’s observation that witness Rival testified in a
straightforward manner and withstood the rigors of cross-examination. Any flaws in her testimony on other aspects
of the incident are minor errors ascribable to inaccuracy in her observation or
perception of rapidly moving events, rather than to an intent to fabricate.

Appellant failed to establish any dubious motive on the part of
witness Rival as to why she would give a fictional testimony against
appellant. Indubitably, said witness,
being a co-employee of victim Padios, would have more reason than any ordinary
witness to make sure that the real killer of her co-worker be brought to
justice. Absent the most compelling
reason or motive, it is inconceivable why witness Rival would openly and
publicly lie or concoct a story which would send an innocent man to jail.

Another consideration that sustains the position of the
prosecution and derails the proposition of the defense is the fact that any
motive for the encounter lies on the part of appellant. Rival testified that, prior to the incident,
appellant Rivera and Mercado had created trouble by breaking bottles inside the
restaurant. The victim chided the two
for creating trouble and brought them out of the establishment, as it was his
duty to do so.[24]
Resenting the fact that they were admonished and ejected from the premises, it
is not hard to conclude that both accused had the ill-conceived reason to take
offense and recourse against the victim. Consequently, and on the foregoing considerations, appellant’s theory of
self-defense must be completely rejected.

The information in the present case specifies evident
premeditation and treachery as qualifying circumstances. However, we agree with appellant that
evident premeditation may not be appreciated against him. The prosecution failed to present sufficient
evidence as to how and when the plan to neutralize the victim was conceived or
what time elapsed before it was carried out. Evident premeditation cannot be appreciated in the absence of direct
evidence of the planning and the preparation to kill,[25]
and that the execution of the criminal act was preceded by cool thought and
reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space
of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.[26]

We are likewise not inclined to hold that there was treachery in
the killing of the victim. We are not
unaware of rulings to the effect that even if the attack is frontal, as in this
case, but the suddenness thereof rendered it impossible for the victim to make
a defense or to escape, alevosia may nevertheless be appreciated. It is to be conceded, however, that such
doctrinal pronouncements necessarily envision that each case must be judged in
light of the attendant factual milieu thereof and, more importantly, under the
overall concept and rationale for treachery which, if considered as a
qualifying circumstance, would change the nature of the unlawful killing and
call for the imposition of the highest penalty under the law.

The trial court considered the killing of the victim as
treacherous on the theory that the accused employed a manner of execution which
ensured the offenders’ safety from any defense or retaliatory act of the victim
and that such mode of execution was deliberately or consciously chosen by
them. It draws for its conclusion upon
the following statements of prosecution witness Emma Rival:

“Q:  How
come that you saw the stabbing incident?

A:   When I returned back
(sic) at El Gusto, I thought they were making a sign to ‘APPEAR’ (clapping of
hands together) then, I noticed that they were already stabbing him, sir.”[27]

which she amplified on cross-examination
in the following manner:

“Q:  Who
were making the sign of appear?

A:   Venancio Mercado and
Mario Rivera, sir.

Q:  What about the deceased?

A:   No, sir.

Q:  What did these two do?

A:   They stabbed him, sir.

Q:  When they were making
(the) sign of appear?

A:   When they were in the
act of making the sign of appear, they suddenly stab(bed) him, sir.[28]

It would, at first impression, imply that appellant and his
co-accused resorted to their ploy of making the “appear” sign to
delude the victim into thinking that their intentions in talking to him were
peaceful so that they could catch him unaware and vulnerable to an unexpected
attack. This may have been their
purpose but, although they did succeed in fatally stabbing the victim, it would
be too simplistic to forthwith conclude that there was treachery without
considering the legal implications of the facts antecedent to this charade of
appellant and his co-accused.

As earlier stated, while the two accused were still inside the
restaurant they started creating trouble by breaking bottles, such that the
victim had to forcibly escort them out of the place.[29]
When witness Emma Rival went to buy her merienda at Lansi’s Store much later,
she saw Rivera there while Mercado was with the victim at the guard post, and
they were obviously joined thereafter by Rivera.[30]
When Rival later left the store to return to El Gusto, these were what she
witnessed:

“Q:  How
far were these two accused from Remely Padios when they were making the sign of
appear?

A:   They called Remely
Padios outside, sir.

Q:  I am asking where were
these two accused (sic) from Remely Padios when they were making the sign of
appear?

A:   They were facing each
other, sir.

Q:  And this Remely Padios
was with a firearm?

A:   Yes, sir.

Q:  You mean to say that it
was not drawn?

A:   It was intact in his
waist, sir.”[31]

From the foregoing facts, we can readily deduce that the victim
was not completely unaware that herein appellant and Mercado posed a danger to
him and which necessarily put him on his guard. He had forced them out of the restaurant and he was aware of
their capacity and disposition to make trouble despite his presence therein as
a security guard. Instead of going
home, they loitered in the premises and later called him outside. He would be naive to believe that their
intentions were anything but hostile considering their resentment and
humiliation after being publicly required to leave the restaurant with the
knowledge of other customers. In fact,
when they were making the “appear” sign, the victim did not join them
in the act. Also, we must not lose
sight of the fact that the victim was duly armed with a .38 caliber revolver
which is more than sufficient as a means of defense against a knife and that,
as a security guard, he was trained not only to detect but also to anticipate
the presence of danger.

Turning to doctrines of earlier vintage but which are still
consistently followed as authoritative precedents, we are reminded that
treachery is not to be presumed, but must be proved as conclusively as the act
it qualifies.[32]
The same degree of proof to dispel any reasonable doubt is required before
treachery may be considered either as an aggravating or qualifying
circumstance.[33]
Further, it has long been declared that the qualifying circumstance of
treachery must be based on some positive conclusive proof and not only upon
hypothetical facts[34]
or on mere suppositions or presumptions.[35]

Again, paragraph 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code itself
requires that the means, methods and forms employed, in order to constitute
treachery, must have been directly and specially sought, adopted or used to
insure both the accomplishment of the criminal design and its
execution with impunity or without risk to the offender.[36]
Thus, in U.S. vs. Namit,[37]
it was held that where the aggressor failed to adopt a mode of attack intended
to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself, the
circumstance that the attack was sudden and unexpected by the person attacked
did not constitute the element of alevosia necessary to raise homicide
to murder. Where it was not established
that the defendant in killing the deceased employed any means by which all
defenses on the part of the latter should be impossible, there is no sufficient
ground to establish alevosia and the killing should be classified as
homicide.[38]

Accordingly, in light of the foregoing statutory and
jurisprudential guideposts, we cannot conclude that the accused acted with
treachery since the means they employed did not eliminate all risks to
themselves. As in the aforecited case
of Asilo, the victim was not taken entirely unaware by the assault
against him. Being adequately armed,
neither can it be said that all means of defense on his part were impossible. Here, by the exercise of a reasonable degree
of anticipatory caution and vigilance, the victim either could or should have
been able to defend himself since he had all the opportunity to do so, and he
could have prepared for or anticipated the attack. We, therefore, hold that under the foregoing disquisition and
considering that doubts are resolved in favor of the accused since criminal
justice inclines in appropriate cases to the milder form of liability, the
crime was not attended by alevosia and should be considered as simple
homicide without any modifying circumstance.

WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby MODIFIED
by convicting the accused of the crime of homicide instead of murder, and
imposing upon him an indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of prision
mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion
temporal, as maximum. In all
other respects, the aforesaid judgment of the court a quo is
AFFIRMED.","on or about October 19, 1989 in the municipality of
Aparri, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the said accused, Mario Rivera and Venancio Mercado, Jr., armed with a
sharp pointed instrument, conspiring together and helping each other, with
intent to kill, with evident premeditation and with treachery, did then and
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and stab one Remely
Padios, inflicting upon him wounds on his body which caused his death.

That the accused Venancio Mercado, Jr. is a recidivist, he having
been previously convicted by final judgment of Homicide in June, 1987, by this
Honorable Court (Regional Trial Court, Aparri), Branch IX, in Criminal Case No.
IX-498, entitled ‘People of the Philippines versus Venancio Mercado, Jr.’ for
Homicide, which crime is embraced in the same title of the Revised Penal
Code

Both accused were arrested and, when arraigned, entered a plea of
not guilty. After due trial, the lower
court found both accused guilty as charged and sentenced them to suffer the
penalty of reclusion perpetua, with all the accessory penalties
provided by law. They were likewise
ordered to pay jointly and severally to the heirs of the deceased the sum of
(1) P50,000.00 by way of death indemnity; (2) P17,128.00 for actual funeral and
other incidental expenses; (3) P20,000.00 by way of moral damages; and (4)
P15,000.00 by way of exemplary damages, for a grand total of P102,128.00,
without sub­sidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. The court further declared that, in the
service of their sentence, they were entitled to full credit for the period of
their preventive imprisonment, provided they had complied with the requirements
of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

A motion for reconsideration was filed by accused Venancio
Mercado, Jr., while accused Mario Rivera filed a notice of appeal. The court a quo, in an amended
decision dated July 15, 1991, acquitted Venancio Mercado, Jr. on the basis of
reasonable doubt since appellant Rivera admitted sole liability for the killing
and denied Mercado’s participation therein.[3]
The subject decision convicting herein appellant is now the subject of our
appellate review.

The principal facts of the case for the prosecution were

and held the hand of Padios which was then holding a firearm. They grappled and when Rivera saw that
Padios was about to fall, he released his grip and ran away.

There is no dispute that on the night of October 19, 1989, Remely
Padios died of stab wounds inflicted by Mario Rivera. 

Pursuing his theory of self-defense, appellant tried to show that
the deceased victim “pushed him” and “suddenly aimed his gun at

could have prepared for or anticipated the attack. We, therefore, hold that under the foregoing disquisition and
considering that doubts are resolved in favor of the accused since criminal
justice inclines in appropriate cases to the milder form of liability, the
crime was not attended by alevosia and should be considered as simple
homicide without any modifying circumstance.

WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby MODIFIED
by convicting the accused of the crime of homicide instead of murder, and
imposing upon him an indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of prision
mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion
temporal, as maximum. In all
other respects, the aforesaid judgment of the court a quo is
AFFIRMED."

THE HEIRS OF EUGENIO SEVILLA, INC., PETITIONER, VS.
THE COURT OF APPEALS AND CORAZON BABAO­-GONZALES, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



DAVIDE, JR., J.:
This is a petition
for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking the
reversal of the respondent Court of Appeals’ decision of 2 November 1978 in
C.A.-G.R. No. SP-07822-R,[1] the
dispositive portion of which provides:

“PREMISES CONSIDERED, the order of respondent Judge dated January
25, 1978 is SET ASIDE and respondent sheriff Jaime de Leon is hereby ordered to
restore petitioner Corazon Babao Gonzales to the possession of the questioned
premises No. 1265 Calle Sande, Tondo, Manila upon the filing by the latter of a
bond in the amount of P10,000.00 for
any and all damages which the Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. may suffer.

SO ORDERED.”

The facts of the case are not disputed by the parties.

On 17 June 1976, the petitioner filed an action for unlawful
detainer in the City Court (now Metropolitan Trial Court) of Manila against
Jesus A. Co; the complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 12235-CV and was
raffled to Branch I thereof. Petitioner
alleged therein that it is the owner of a parcel of land, with a theater
building named Cinema Gigi, standing thereon, located at Calle Sande,
Tondo, Manila, and that Jesus Co, as lessee of the theater building, failed to
pay the agreed rentals at the rate of two thousand pesos (P2,000.00) a month
since 1974. In his Answer, Jesus Co
countered that it is he who owns both the lot and the theater building, having
acquired the same by virtue of a sale made by the petitioner; he further avers
that on 15 June 1976, he leased Cinema Gigi to herein private respondent
Corazon Babao-Gonzales for a period of ten (10) years.

During the pendency of the unlawful detainer case, particularly
on 30 September 1977, Jesus A. Co filed an action “To Quite (sic)
Possession, Ownership and Issuance of Title” against the petitioner in the
then Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Manila. The case involved the same property
abovementioned and was docketed as Civil Case No. 105465. A motion to dismiss the complaint was filed
by the petitioner.

On 30 September 1977, the City Court of Manila rendered a
decision in the unlawful detainer case in favor of the petitioner, ordering, inter
alia, defendant Jesus A. Co:

“x x x and any
and all persons, if any, claiming under
him or otherwise privies
to him in the occupancy
of the said premises referred to in
the complaint to vacate the same immediately; x x
x.”[2]

In the same decision, the court ruled that petitioner is the
owner of the property and that the so-called Deed of Sale by installment over
it, purportedly executed by Ramon Sevilla in favor of Co, is a forgery.

Defendant Jesus A. Co failed to appeal from this decision, thus
resulting in its becoming final and executory. On 3 November 1977, a writ of execution was issued by the City Court and
served by special sheriff Jaime L. de Leon on the occupants of the property.

On 15 November 1977, Corazon Babao-Gonzales, respondent herein,
claiming to be a lessee of Jesus A. Co with respect to the subject premises,
filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for
“Declaratory Relief and to Vacate Judgment, Execution Order and Notice to
Vacate, with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction,”
against herein petitioner, Jaime de Leon, National Deputy Sheriff, and
the Hon. Judge Gregorio Garcia, Presiding Judge of Branch I, City Court of
Manila.[3]
The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 112027.

On 16 November 1977, after ejecting all the occupants of Cinema
Gigi, sheriff Jaime
de Leon padlocked and closed the premises, delivering, at the same time,
possession thereof to the petitioner.

On the same day, 16 November 1977, after the sheriff delivered
possession of the subject premises to petitioner thru its president, Ramon S.
Sevilla, and after the latter left the premises, Corazon Babao-Gonzales,
together with Atty. Beltran Sotto and two John Does, forcibly destroyed the
chain and padlocks of the building and took possession thereof.[4]

The following day, 17 November 1977, in Civil Case No. 112027,
Judge Pedro Cenzon issued a restraining order prohibiting petitioner from
reacquiring possession of the subject premises. Petitioner filed a motion to lift the restraining order. A hearing was thereafter conducted on said
motion and Gonzales’ application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction.

After the hearing, Judge Pedro Cenzon issued on 25 January 1978
an Orders[5]
denying the petition for declaratory relief and lifting the restraining order
issued therein, based on the following findings
of facts:

“a. The issuance of the writ of execution was
based on a final judgment of the City Court of Manila, Branch I, in Civil Case
No. 12235-CV entitled ‘Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. versus Jesus Co, for
ejectment. This judgment has not been
set aside in any proceeding as null and void.


b. The writ of execution was duly served by
the respondent sheriff, implemented and completed. The possession of the premises in question has been turned over
to the possession of the private respondent, Ramon Sevilla, by the respondent
sheriff as per Exhibit 8.

c. If the petitioner (Corazon Babao-­Gonzales)
is now in physical possession of the premises in question, such physical
possession is a mere interference or disturbance of the possession of the
private respondent (Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc.) after he (sic) acquired it
when the respondent sheriff delivered the premises to him (sic) in compliance
with the writ of execution. There is
nothing to restrain. There (sic)
respondent City Court judge has already ordered execution of the judgment and
the respondent sheriff has already carried out the order and placed the private
respondent in possession of the premises in question.

d. The petitioner is herself a wrong doer when
she interferred (sic) with the possession of the private respondent after it
was given to him (sic) by the respondent sheriff.

e. The petitioner has failed to established
(sic) a clear or positive right over the property in question. Her socalled (sic) right is predicated on a
contract of lease between herself and Jesus Co as the lessor-owner of the
property. But the ownership of Jesus Co
on the property is based on a Deed of Sale by installment which the PC Crime
Laboratory, Camp Crame, Quezon City, has declared to be a forgery. Likewise, the very notary public who
allegedly notarized this document it (sic) to be a fake. In short, the right of the petitioner on
(sic) the property in question is not in essee or ‘in being’ up to this hour.

f. The existence of Civil Case No. 10465 (sic)
entitled ‘Jesus Altavano Co vs. the Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, represented by
Ramon Sevilla’ in Branch IX of this Court where the issue is allegedly one of
ownership, will not be rendered moot and academic
by the denial of a writ of preliminary injunction by this Branch of the
Court. If Jesus Altavano Co, the
plaintiff in that case will be declared the owner of the property in question,
then its possession will go with his ownership. But the final judgment of the City Court, Branch I, in the
ejectment case should be, as it was, executed, because it is a valid decision
until declared otherwise in a proper proceedings (sic). Importantly, the petitioner did not
intervene in Civil Case No. 12235 of Branch I of the City Court of
Manila.”

x x x

On 9 February 1978, petitioner herein filed a motion praying that
Gonzales and her counsel be held guilty of indirect contempt and be ordered to
vacate the Cinema Gigi. Acting
thereon, Judge Jose B. Herrera issued on 8 March 1978 an Order directing
“Deputy Sheriff Jaime de Leon, who may avail himself (sic) of the assistance
of any law enforcement agency, to eject the defendant Jesus A. Co and all other
persons claiming right (sic) under him from the premises of Cine GIGI situated
at Calle Sande St., Tondo, Manila, and to restore plaintiff to the possession
thereof.”[6]

Her motion to reconsider the Order of Judge Pedro Cenzon in Civil
Case No. 112027 of 25 January 1978 having been denied, herein private
respondent Babao-Gonzales filed with the respondent Court on 25 May 1978
“a Petition for Review with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and
Damages,”[7]
docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. SP-07822-R. In the said petition, private respondent claimed that she has a better
right to possess the subject premises and prayed, inter alia, that a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction be issued to restore her to the possession of the questioned
premises. On 2 November 1978, the
respondent Court rendered a decision setting aside the 25 January 1978 Order of
Judge Pedro Cenzon and ordering Sheriff Jaime de Leon to restore respondent
Corazon Babao-Gonzales to the possession of the questioned premises upon the
filing of a bond to answer for any and all damages that may be suffered by
petitioner corporation.[8] In
granting the petition, respondent Court relied on the following arguments:

“We find merit in the instant petition. In the first place, it is a fact that
petitioner Corazon Babao Gonzales is not a sub-lessee of Jesus Altavano Co but
a lessee in which case she cannot come under the term ‘persons claiming under
him’. Secondly, in the ejectment case
(Civil Case No. 12235-CV), the defendant was Jesus A. Co only. To enforce the judgment in said ejectment
case against herein petitioner Corazon Babao Gonzales would indeed be violative
of the constitutional provision regarding the due process clause. Thirdly, the action to quiet title
instituted by Jesus Altavao (sic) Co vs. Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. (Civil
Case No. 105465) is still pending trial before the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch IX. It was not within
the competence of the City Court in the ejectment suit to say that the true
owner of the property are the Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. because the sale
in favor of Jesus Altavano Co was a forgery. This matter is within the competence and jurisdiction of the court of
first instance and precisely that is the issue in said Civil Case 105465. x x x We believe it would be more prudent to
maintain the status quo of the parties and for the respondent sheriff and his
duly authorized representatives and agents to desist from enforcing the writ of
execution issued by the City Court of Manila in Civil Case No. 0-12235-CV
against Corazon Babao Gonzales until the court of first instance has decided
the action to quiet possession, ownership and possession of title.”

Its motion for reconsideration of the above decision having been
denied, petitioner filed the instant petition on 2 March 1979.

On 9 March 1979, this Court required respondent to comment on the
petition within ten (10) days from receipt of notice.[9]

However, before respondent could submit its Comment, petitioner,
on 13 March 1979, filed a supplemental petition[10]
apprising this Court of the fact that Civil Case No. 105465, the action for
Quieting of Title before the Court of First Instance of Manila, was dismissed
on the ground of res judicata by said court in the Order handed down on
26 February 1979.[11] Co
appealed the Order to the Court of Appeals, which was docketed as C.A.-G.R. No.
67454-R.

Private respondent subsequently submitted both her comment to the
petition[12]
and comment to the supplemental petition.[13]

This Court resolved to give due course to the petition and
required both parties to submit their respective Memoranda simultaneously,
which they complied with.

On 2 March 1987, this Court required both parties to manifest
whether they are still interested in prosecuting this case.[14]

Petitioner manifested on 30 March 1987 that it is still
interested in prosecuting the case; it likewise informed this Court that Co’s
appeal (C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R) was dismissed by the respondent Court of Appeals
on 5 May 1981, as “evidenced by the Court of Appeals’ entry of judgment
dated 24 May 1981.”[15] The
dismissal was based on Co’s failure to file the record on appeal.

In this petition, petitioner raises the following issues:[16]

“Whether the City Court of Manila has the jurisdiction to pass
upon the issue of ownership in an ejectment case brought before it.

Whether certiorari, petition for review, or appeal to the
Court of Appeals is the proper remedy against, a final order or decision of the
Court of First Instance in a petition for Declaratory Relief.

Whether a writ of execution in an action for illegal detainer is
enforceable against an occupant who claims to be a lessee of the party ordered
ejected therefrom.”

This petition is impressed with merit.

Since the first two (2) issues have become moot and academic in
view of the dismissal of Jesus Co’s appeal, C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R, We shall
focus our discussion on the third issue.

To recapitulate, the decision in the unlawful detainer case,
Civil Case No. 12235-CV, wherein the court held that the petitioner is the
owner of the subject premises, the so-called deed of sale on installment upon
which Co based his claim of ownership is a forgery and Co is a mere lessee
thereof, had long become final and had in fact been executed. Also, Co’s action for Quieting of Title,
Civil Case No. 105465, filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila, was
dismissed on the ground that, the cause of action is barred by prior
judgment. The dismissal had likewise
become final because Co’s appeal (C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R) to the Court of
Appeals was dismissed and entry of judgment was made on 24 May 1981.

In view of the above final decision and order, herein private
respondent cannot claim any better right than Mr. Co.

In Jorge vs. Consolasion,[17] this
Court held:

“The petitioners, as mere lessees of the losing party, have no
rights whatsoever to claim and to be protected by the mantle of the law and
neither do they have the right to intervene and/or block the execution of the
judgment in Civil Case No. 1160.”

Furthermore, private respondent was in reality a mere
sublessee. It is a well settled rule in
this jurisdiction that “the sublessee … can invoke no right superior to
that of his sublessor.”[18] In Guevara
Realty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,[19] We
held:

“‘A Judgment of eviction against a lessee affects his
sub-lessees, even if the latter are not sued in the ejectment case. This is so, because a sublessee can invoke
no right superior to that of his sublessor, and the moment the latter is duly
ousted from the premises, the former has no leg to stand on. The sublessees’ right, if any, is to demand
reparation for damages from his sublessor, should the latter be at fault. The sublessees can only assert such right of
possession as could have been granted them by their sublessor, their right of
possession depending entirely upon that of the latter.’ (Tolentino, Civil Code
of the Philippines, Vol. 5, pp. 194-195, citing the cases of Ng Sui Tan v.
Amparo, 80 Phil 921; Go King v. Geronimo, 81 Phil. 445; Sipin v. Court of First
Instance of Manila, 74 Phil. 650; Madrigal v. Ang Sam To, et al., 46 Off. Gas.
2173).”

Hence, even if respondent was not made a party in the unlawful
detainer case, the judgment evicting Jesus Co is equally binding on her,
contrary to her contention.

WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed decision of the respondent
Court of Appeals in C.A-G.R. SP-07822-R is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and
the Order of the trial court of 25 January 1978 in Civil Case No. 112027 is
REINSTATED.

Costs against respondent.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PETITIONER, VS. JUDGE JUAN L. BOCAR AND JOSE SIMBORIO Y SALONGA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



REYES, J. B. L., J.:
Petition for certiorari against the order of the Court of First Instance
of Manila dated 13 May 1966 (in Criminal Case No. 82116) granting the petition
for bail of therein accused Jose Simborio y Salonga on a P20,000.00 bond.

In an information filed on 19 April 1966, Jose Simborio y Salonga was charged with the crime of murder for the fatal
shooting of Avelino Concepcion,
Jr. in the evening of 11 March 1966.  It was there alleged that the accused, in
conspiracy with Marmolito Catelo
y Rivera (alias Sonny Catelo) and others whose
identity and whereabouts were unknown, shot Avelino Concepcion, Jr. with a gun, wounding the latter in the
abdomen which directly and immediately caused his death (on 14 March
1966).  The offense was said to have been
attended by the circumstances of premeditation, treachery, abuse of superior strength,
and the use of motor vehicle.

On 22 April 1966,
the accused filed a motion for his provisional release on bail, claiming that
the evidence of his guilt was not strong and, considering his personal
circumstances and social standing, there is no probability that he would
flee.  Thereupon, the motion was heard on
29 April 1966, during which hearing the prosecution presented its evidence,
consisting of the ante mortem statement of the victim, Avelino Concepcion, Jr., given to
Patrolman J. Sta. Maria at the Philippine General Hospital to the effect that
accused Simborio was in the company of gunwielder Sonny Catelo when he (Concepcion) was shot; the statement of alleged eyewitness
Ruben Sumalde y Olisco that
when Sonny Catelo shot Concepcion,
Jr. the accused was holding the victim’s left arm; and the statement of Manolito Gascon, the driver of
the car used by Catelo and company, to the effect
that the accused was with them at least before the incident happened.  Upon the other hand, the accused contended that
at the time of the incident he was taking an examination at the Mapua Institute of Techno­logy.  To support this allegation, he presented the
examination paper and the testimonies of his instructor and the latter’s
assistant that the said examination paper could not have been submitted if movant did not take the test on the date in question.

After the parties had filed their respective memoranda, the
court, considering the fact that –

“The prosecution admits that it was not.  Simborio who fired
the gun and shot Concepcion
but another suspect still at-large by the name of Sonny Catelo.  But the prosecution insists that Simborio was present, was the one who identified the
victim, and was in fact holding the victim’s arm when the latter was fired
upon.

“In view of the claim of the accused that he was not present
at the scene of the crime, but was in fact taking a final examination in the Mapua Institute of Technology at the time the alleged crime
was committed, the fact of his examination paper having been produced, and the
testimony of the professor that it can not happen that a student can submit an
examination paper without attending the test, or that an examination paper can
be submitted without the student having taken part in the examination, added to
the fact that the killer and the trigger man was not Simborio
but another suspect named Sonny Catelo, who is still
at-large, which the prosecu­tion admits, as in fact it states in its memorandum
that the principal suspects are still at-large’, which is an indirect admission
that the herein accused is not as guilty as the said real principal suspects;
the counter statement of the assistant to the professor, Gumangan,
to the contrary notwithstanding, which in effect does not substantially alter
his first affidavit because he did not have to personally know the student, but
the fact remains that ‘an examination paper submitted after the examination
bearing the name of Jose Simborio‘ make out a very
contro­versial issue as to whether or not Simborio
was present at the scene of the crime at the time”,

reached the conclusion that the
prosecution evidence as such does not meet the required standard of
“strong evidence” to justify the denial of the accused’s
right to bail.  Consequently, the
petition was granted and the provisional release of the accused allowed on a
bond for P20,000.00.  The Assistant City
Fiscal filed the present petition, claiming that the respondent judge acted in
grave abuse of discretion and with bias in issuing the aforementioned order.

Petitioner’s charge of grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the respondent judge is premised on the allegation that the motion for bail was
granted in disregard of the manifestation of the trial fiscal that he was
introducing witnesses to amplify the exhibits already presented.  In short, it is here contended that in
granting the petition for bail before the trial fiscal could introduce his wit­nesses,
the prosecution had been deprived of its right to present complete evi­dence
that would justify the disapproval of the petition, or that the order allowing
the temporary liberty of the accused on bail was based on incomplete evidence.

It can not be denied that, under our regime of laws, and
concomitant with the legal presumption of innocence before conviction, an accused
is entitled to provisional liberty on bail,[1]
the only exception being when he is charged with a capital offense and the
evidence of his guilt is strong.[2]
But even in the latter instance, the high regard reserved by the law for
personal freedom is un­derscored by the provision placing upon the prosecution,
not on the defense, the burden of proving that the accused is not entitled to
bail.[3]
This protective attitude towards the sanctity of the liberty of a person
notwithstanding, due process also demands that in the matter of bail the
prosecution should be afforded full opportunity to present proof of the guilt
of the accused.[4]
Thus, if it were true that the prosecution in this case was deprived of the
right to present its evidence against the bail petition, or that the order
granting such petition was issued upon incomplete evidence, then the issuance
of the order would really constitute grave abuse of discretion that would call
for the remedy of certiorari.[5]

There is record, however, that while the trial fiscal manifested
his intention to introduce witnesses to amplify the exhibits already
adduced by the prosecution, such manifestation was in effect withdrawn when he
offered to submit the matter for resolution of the court on the evidence
already presented, provided the accused would admit said exhibits — which
condition the accused accepted.  The
transcript of the notes of the proceedings in the court below reads as follows:

And there is nothing unlawful or
irregular about the above procedure.  The
declara­tions constitute judicial admissions, which are allowed by the rules[8]
and are binding on the parties, by virtue of which the prosecution dispensed
with the in­troduction of additional evidence and the defense waived the right
to contest or dispute the veracity of the statements contained in the
exhibits.  Clearly, it can not be claimed
that there had been deprivation of the prosecution’s right to present all its
evidence.  If the evidence already
adduced turned out to be inade­quate for purposes of denying the petition for
bail, the prosecution can not lay the blame at anyone else’s door; it took the
risk in resting its case on the exhibits already presented, which, in the lower
court’s opinion, did not suffice.

Neither is it correct to say that the respondent judge gave more
credence to the alibi of the accused rather than to the statements made
by the victim and an eye­witness to the incident, thereby showing bias in favor
of the accused.  It must be remembered
that the question raised for the determination of the lower court was not the
guilt or innocence of the accused of the crime charged, but whether or not the
evidence of his guilt is strong.  In
taking cognizance of the fact that the state­ments of the victim and witness Sumalde, that the accused was present at the scene of the
incident and even held the arm of the victim when the latter was shot at, is
contradicted by the examination paper and the testimonies of the instructor and
his assistant tending to establish the presence of the accused in school at the
time when the shooting occurred, the respondent judge did not rule on the ad­missibility
and probative value of said evidence.  It
was merely held that with the issue of the whereabouts of the accused when the
crime was committed having thus become contentious, the evidence of guilt of
the accused (so far presented) can not be considered strong.

WHEREFORE, finding no grave abuse of discretion in the
order here in question, the petition is hereby dismissed, without costs.

Concepcion, C.J., Dizon,
Makalintal, Zaldivar,
Sanchez, Ruiz Castro, Fernando, Capistrano, Teehankee, and Barredo, JJ., concur.","Petition for certiorari against the order of the Court of First Instance
of Manila dated 13 May 1966 (in Criminal Case No. 82116) granting the petition
for bail of therein accused Jose Simborio y Salonga on a P20,000.00 bond.

In an information filed on 19 April 1966, Jose Simborio y Salonga was charged with the crime of murder for the fatal
shooting of Avelino Concepcion,
Jr. in the evening of 11 March 1966.  It was there alleged that the accused, in
conspiracy with Marmolito Catelo
y Rivera (alias Sonny Catelo) and others whose
identity and whereabouts were unknown, shot Avelino Concepcion, Jr. with a gun, wounding the latter in the
abdomen which directly and immediately caused his death (on 14 March
1966).  The offense was said to have been
attended by the circumstances of premeditation, treachery, abuse of superior strength,
and the use of motor vehicle.

On 22 April 1966,
the accused filed a motion for his provisional release on bail, claiming that
the evidence of his guilt was not strong and, considering his personal
circumstances and social standing, there is no probability that he would
flee.  Thereupon, the motion was heard on
29 April 1966, during which hearing the prosecution presented its evidence,
consisting of the ante mortem statement of the victim, Avelino Concepcion, Jr., given to
Patrolman J. Sta. Maria at the Philippine General Hospital to the effect that
accused Simborio was in the company of gunwielder Sonny Catelo when he (Concepcion) was shot; the statement of alleged eyewitness
Ruben Sumalde y Olisco that
when Sonny Catelo shot Concepcion,
Jr. the accused was holding the victim’s left arm; and the statement of Manolito Gascon, the driver of
the car used by Catelo and company, to the effect
that the accused was with them at least before the incident happened.  Upon the other hand, the accused contended that
at the time of the incident he was taking an examination at the Mapua Institute of Techno­logy.  To support this allegation, he presented the
examination paper and the testimonies of his instructor and the latter’s
assistant that the said examination paper could not have been submitted if movant did not take the test on the date in question.

After the parties had filed their respective memoranda, the
court reached the conclusion that the
prosecution evidence as such does not meet the required standard of
“strong evidence” to justify the denial of the accused’s
right to bail.  Consequently, the
petition was granted and the provisional release of the accused allowed on a
bond for P20,000.00.  The Assistant City
Fiscal filed the present petition, claiming that the respondent judge acted in
grave abuse of discretion and with bias in issuing the aforementioned order.

Petitioner’s charge of grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the respondent judge is premised on the allegation that the motion for bail was
granted in disregard of the manifestation of the trial fiscal that he was
introducing witnesses to amplify the exhibits already presented.  In short, it is here contended that in
granting the petition for bail before the trial fiscal could introduce his wit­nesses,
the prosecution had been deprived of its right to present complete evi­dence
that would justify the disapproval of the petition, or that the order allowing
the temporary liberty of the accused on bail was based on incomplete evidence.

It can not be denied that, under our regime of laws, and
concomitant with the legal presumption of innocence before conviction, an accused
is entitled to provisional liberty on bail,[1]
the only exception being when he is charged with a capital offense and the
evidence of his guilt is strong.[2]
But even in the latter instance, the high regard reserved by the law for
personal freedom is un­derscored by the provision placing upon the prosecution,
not on the defense, the burden of proving that the accused is not entitled to
bail.[3]
This protective attitude towards the sanctity of the liberty of a person
notwithstanding, due process also demands that in the matter of bail the
prosecution should be afforded full opportunity to present proof of the guilt
of the accused.[4]
Thus, if it were true that the prosecution in this case was deprived of the
right to present its evidence against the bail petition, or that the order
granting such petition was issued upon incomplete evidence, then the issuance
of the order would really constitute grave abuse of discretion that would call
for the remedy of certiorari.[5]

There is record, however, that while the trial fiscal manifested
his intention to introduce witnesses to amplify the exhibits already
adduced by the prosecution, such manifestation was in effect withdrawn when he
offered to submit the matter for resolution of the court on the evidence
already presented, provided the accused would admit said exhibits — which
condition the accused accepted. 



","is it correct to say that the respondent judge gave more
credence to the alibi of the accused rather than to the statements made
by the victim and an eye­witness to the incident, thereby showing bias in favor
of the accused.

that the question raised for the determination of the lower court was not the
guilt or innocence of the accused of the crime charged, but whether or not the

[ G.R. Nos. 255324 & 255353. April 12, 2023 ]
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. TOLEDO POWER COMPANY, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



DIMAAMPAO, J.:
Via this Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (petitioner) assails the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc, affirming the adjudication of its Special First Division[4] and denying the motion for reconsideration thereof, respectively, in the consolidated cases docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000. The CTA Special First Division ordered the refund or the issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P399,550.84 in favor of Toledo Power Company (respondent), representing its unutilized input value-added tax (VAT) for the first quarter of taxable year (TY) 2003.
Stripped of unnecessary verbiage, the facts of the case follow:

Petitioner is the duly appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) empowered to perform the duties of its office, including the power to decide refunds of internal revenue taxes.[5]

Respondent, on the other hand, a general partnership duly registered and existing under Philippine laws, is engaged in the business of power generation and the subsequent sale of generated power to the National Power Corporation, the Cebu Electric Cooperative III, and the Visayan Electric Company, Inc. As a VAT taxpayer, respondent is registered with the BIR, which released to it Tax Identification Number 003-883-626 and Certificate of Registration Revenue District Office (RDO) Control No. 94-083-000300.[6]

On April 22, 2005, respondent filed with the CTA Special First Division a judicial claim for the refund or issuance of tax credit certificate in the amount of P3,907,783.80. This represented the unutilized input VAT from its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods attributable to zero-rated sales for the first quarter of TY 2003. The petition was docketed as CTA Case No. 7233.[7] As it happened, the CTA Special First Division initially granted respondent’s claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate.[8] However, upon motion for reconsideration of both parties, respondent’s petition was dismissed pursuant to the Court’s pronouncements in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc. (Aichi).[9]

Before the CTA En Banc, respondent sought recourse on the dismissal of its petition.[10] However, the CTA En Banc affirmed the ruling of its Special First Division applying the case in Aichi that the petition was prematurely filed.[11]
Respondent’s bid for a reconsideration of the foregoing having been denied, it filed a petition for review before the Court praying for the reversal of the CTA En Banc‘s disposition.[12]

In disposing the case, the Court partially granted respondent’s petition and remanded the case to the CTA Special First Division for computation of refundable input VAT, viz.—

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition in G.R. No. 195175 is DENIED, while the Petition in G.R. No. 199645 is PARTLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the case in G.R. No. 199645 is hereby REMANDED to the Court of Tax Appeals insofar as the Petition in [CTA] Case No. 7233, for the purpose of the computation of the refundable input VAT attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales of [respondent] for the first quarter of 2003.

SO ORDERED.[13]

Remand to the CTA Special First Division and
 Appeal to the CTA En Banc

Accordingly, the CTA En Banc remanded CTA Case No. 7233 to its Special First Division for the computation of respondent’s input VAT attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales for the first quarter of 2003.[14]
On July 13, 2018, the Special First Division rendered an Amended Decision[15] partially granting respondent’s claim for refund in the amount of P399,550.84, and disposed in this wise:

WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing considerations, the Petition for Review filed by [respondent] vs. [petitioner] in CTA Case No. 7233 is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the [petitioner] is hereby ORDERED TO REFUND or TO ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE in favor of [respondent] in the amount of THREE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY PERSOS AND EIGHTY-FOUR CENTAVOS ([PHP] 399,550.84), representing its unutilized input VAT first quarter of taxable year 2003.

SO ORDERED.[16]

Displeased, both parties moved for partial reconsideration,[17] which the CTA Third Division denied for lack of merit, viz.:

“WHEREFORE, premises considered, [petitioner]’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration (Re: Decision promulgated 13 July 2018) and [respondent]’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration (Re: Amended Decision dated July 13, 2018) are DENIED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.“[18]

Unruffled, both parties elevated the case to the CTA En Banc, docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000. Eventually, the cases were consolidated.[19]

In the impugned Decision, the CTA En Banc decreed, inter alia, that there was no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the CTA Division. Thus, the consolidated petitions were denied—

WHEREFORE, the Petitions for Review are DENIED for lack of merit. The Amended Decision dated July 13, 2018 and Resolution dated December 19, 2018 are AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[20]

Petitioner moved anew for the reconsideration of the foregoing Decision, which the CTA En Banc ultimately denied in the challenged Resolution.[21]

Through the instant Petition, petitioner raises issues, which can be summed in two:
One, did the CTA En Banc correctly interpret and apply the law and jurisprudence to the case at bench?

Two, did respondent present sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate?[22]

Petitioner contends that the CTA En Banc erred in holding that respondent established its entitlement to P399,550.84 worth of unutilized input tax for the first quarter of 2003. Section 112 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997[23] (Tax Code) does not dispense with the requirement that unutilized input taxes be directly attributable to a taxpayer’s zero-rated sales. Here, respondent had the burden of establishing the attributability of its unutilized input tax to its zero-rated sales transactions in order to qualify for a tax refund or credit under Section 112 of the Tax Code. Moreover, existing laws at the time respondent applied for refund of its alleged unutilized input tax required direct and entire attribution to its zero-rated sales.[24] To bolster its claim, petitioner invokes the Court’s rulings in Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR[25] (Atlas Case) and CIR v. Team Sual Corporation[26] (Team Sual Case).[27]

For its part, respondent posits that the CTA En Banc correctly upheld that law does not require a claimant for refund or tax credit to prove that the input tax is directly attributable to its zero-rated transactions and which are directly attributable to its taxable transactions. In any case, the determination of its entitlement to refund of input tax is a question of fact that is beyond the scope of a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[28]

The Petition is bereft of merit.
Preliminarily, the Court emphasizes that it is not a trier of facts. Only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[29] Questions of fact are generally proscribed.[30]

A petition raising questions of law is one which raises doubts as to what the law is on a certain state of facts as opposed to a petition raising a question of fact which occurs when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them.[31]

In claims for tax refunds, this Court distinguished a question of law from a question of fact as follows:

[xxx] the proper interpretation of the provision on tax refund that does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties-litigants is a question of law. Conversely, it may be said that if the appeal essentially calls for the re-examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the appellant, the same raises a question of fact. Often repeated is the distinction that there is a question of law in a given case when doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts; there is a question of fact when doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts.

Verily, the sufficiency of a claimant’s evidence and the determination of the amount of refund, as called for in this case, are questions of fact, which are for the judicious determination by the CTA of the evidence on record.[32]

Mixed questions of fact and law are raised in the case at bench. For one, whether respondent presented sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate is a question of fact. For another, the issue on the correct interpretation and application of law and jurisprudence is a question of law.

As to the question of law

The Court emphasizes that the applicable law to the instant Petition is the Tax Code in view of the principle of prospective application of tax laws.[33] Here, respondent’s claim for tax refund and issuance of tax credit certificate of its unutilized input taxes for the first quarter of TY 2003 was filed with the CTA on April 22, 2005. Meanwhile, the amendments brought forth by Republic Act (RA) No. 9337[34] took effect on July 1, 2005 or more than two months after respondent filed the judicial claim subject of this case. Thusly, the instant Petition shall be examined based on the parameters of the Tax Code, prior to any amendments brought by RA No. 9337, and its effective implementing rules and regulations.

Section 112(A) of the Tax Code provides for the requirements for refund and tax credits of input taxes, viz.—

Section 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. – 
 

(A)
Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. – Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (b) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the an1ount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales.
Elsewise stated, a VAT-registered person engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales may apply for a claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for its creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales. However, the input taxes must have not been applied to any output taxes. Moreover, the application or claim must be made within two years after the close of the quarter when the sales were made. Mere semblance of attribution to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales would suffice.

Contrary to petitioner’s allegation, the Tax Code does not require direct and entire attribution of input taxes to the zero-rated or effectively zero­-rated sales before it may be made subject of a tax refund or claim for tax credit certificate. In fact, the law only mentions the phrase “directly and entirely” in reference to mixed transactions or in cases where the taxpayer is engaged in both zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales and VAT-taxable or VAT-exempt sales—such that input taxes which cannot be directly and entirely attributed to specific transactions shall be allocated based on the sales volume of each transaction.

The word attribute means to explain something by indicating a cause.[35] Thus, when the law states that the input VAT must be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, it simply means that the input VAT must be incurred on a purchase or importation which causes or relates to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales but not necessarily a part of the finished goods subject of such sales.

Based on this parameter, the input taxes of taxpayers engaged purely in either zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions are presumably attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated activity as they are not engaged in any other category for VAT purposes. All its purchases of goods and services are made in relation to or caused by its zero-rated or effectively zero-rated activities. Otherwise, how else would the taxpayer utilize its purchase but for its main activity which, incidentally in this case, is a zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transaction? The remaining requirement for it to claim refund or tax credit certificate for unutilized input tax are the documentary requirements and the period within which the same must be filed.

Meanwhile, taxpayers engaged in mixed transactions must first categorize its input taxes. Those which can be directly and entirely attributed to VAT-taxable transactions, VAT-exempt transaction, zero-rated transactions, and effectively zero-rated transactions shall first be applied to the respective output tax resulting from such transaction. Thereafter, residual input taxes, or input tax which “cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, [xxx] shall be allocated to any one of the transactions [xxx] proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales.” Simply stated, even if the input VAT cannot be directly and entirely allocated in any of these transactions, the taxpayer may still apply the input VAT proportionately based on the volume of the transactions. This is so because requirement of direct and entire attributability only applies in mixed transactions and only to the extent that input taxes can be attributed as a particular transaction.

This interpretation is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the definition of creditable input taxes under Section 110 of the Tax Code and the effective revenue regulations at the time.

Section 110 of the Tax Code provides:

Section 110. Tax Credits. —

b. Creditable Input Tax. —

(b)
Any input tax evidenced by a VAT invoice or official receipt issued in accordance with Section 113 hereof on the following transactions shall be creditable against the output tax:
(b)
Purchase or importation of goods:
(b)
For sale; or
(ii)
For conversion into or intended to form part of a finished product for sale including packaging materials; or
(iii)
For use as supplies in the course of business; or
(iv)
For use as materials supplied in the sale of service; or
(v)
For use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation or amortization is allowed under this Code, except automobiles, aircraft and yachts.
(b)
Purchase of services on which a value-added tax has been actually paid.
(2)
The input tax on domestic purchase of goods or properties shall be creditable:
(b)
To the purchaser upon consummation of sale and on importation of goods or properties; and
(b)
To the importer upon payment of the value-added tax prior to the release of the goods from the custody of the Bureau of Customs.
Provided, that the input tax on goods purchased or imported in a calendar month for use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation is allowed under this Code shall be spread evenly over the a month of acquisition and the fifty-nine (59) succeeding months if the aggregate acquisition cost for such goods, excluding the VAT component thereof, exceeds One million pesos (P1,000,000): Provided, however, That if the estimated useful life of the capital good is less than five (5) years, as used for depreciation purposes, then the input VAT shall be spread over such a shorter period: Provided, further, That the amortization of the input VAT shall only be allowed until December 31, 2021 after which taxpayers with unutilized input VAT on capital goods purchased or imported shall be allowed to apply the same as scheduled until fully utilized: Provided, finally, That in the case of purchase of services, lease or use of properties, the input tax shall be creditable to the purchaser, lessee or licensee upon payment of the compensation, rental, royalty or free.
(3)
A VAT-registered person who is also engaged in transactions not subject to the value-added tax shall be allowed tax credit as follows:
(b)
Total input tax which can be directly attributed to transactions subject to value-added tax; and
(b)
A ratable portion of any input tax which cannot be directly attributed to either activity.
The term “input tax” means the value-added tax due from or paid by a VAT-registered person in the course of his trade or business on importation of goods or local purchase of goods or services, including lease or use of property, from a VAT-registered person. It shall also include the transitional input tax determined in accordance with Section 111 of this Code.

The term “output tax” means the value-added tax due on the sale or lease of taxable goods or properties or services by any person registered or required to register under Section 236 of this Code.

Contrary to petitioner’s submission, creditable input taxes go beyond taxes on purchases of goods that form part of the finished product of the taxpayer or those which are directly used in the chain of production. The Tax Code did not limit creditable input taxes to those incurred on purchases which ultimately find its way to taxpayer’s finished products for sale. Input taxes incurred on other purchases may still be credited against output tax liability. Despite not forming part of the finished goods, Section 110 treats as creditable those input tax due from or paid in the course of their trade or business on the importation of goods or local purchase of goods or services, including lease or use of property, from a VAT-registered person. Surely, even if the purchased goods do not find their way into the taxpayer’s finished product, the input tax incurred therefrom can still be credited against the output tax if it is (1) incurred or paid in the course of the VAT-registered taxpayer’s trade or business, and (2) supported by a VAT invoice issued in accordance with the invoicing requirements of the law.

Along this grain, the Court takes this opportunity to clarify its earlier rulings in Atlas[36] and Team Sual[37] which petitioner cites in support of its position.

In Atlas, petitioner Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (Atlas) applied for a tax refund or a tax credit certificate with herein petitioner in the amount of P842,336,291.60 representing its excess VAT credit of the fourth quarter of 1994. On the same date, it also filed a claim for refund with the CTA.

As it happened, the CTA denied Atlas’ claim for failure to comply with the documentary requirements under Section 16 of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87[38], as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88.[39] Upon reconsideration, the CTA allowed Atlas to present additional documents together with its proof of non-availment for prior and succeeding quarters of the input VAT subject of its claim for refund. Still and all, the CTA denied the claim and ruled that Atlas failed to substantiate its claim that it has not applied its alleged excess input taxes to any of its subsequent quarter’s output tax liability.

Atlas elevated its case to the Court via a petition for review on certiorari insisting that it submitted pieces of evidence other than those required by law which would establish the existence of the input VAT and that the same had not been applied to its output tax liability. In denying the petition, the Court, not being a trier of facts, deferred to the factual findings of the CTA and the Court of Appeals, viz. 

In the present case, petitioner is basically asking this Court to review the factual findings of the CTA and the CA. Petitioner insists that it had presented the necessary documents or copies thereof with the CTA that would prove that it is entitled to a tax refund. [xxx] Again, citing the earlier case of Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR, this Court has expounded the nature and bases of claiming tax refund[.]

As to the evidence that must be presented, the provisions of the pertinent laws provide:

Section 106, Tax Code

Refunds or tax credits of input tax. — (a) Any VAT­-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated, may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in case of zero-rated sales under Section 100 (a) (2) (A) (I), (ii) and (b) and Section 102 (b) (1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof have been duly accounted for in accordance with the regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales.

Section 16 of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, dated April 7, 1988

A photocopy of the purchase invoice or receipt evidencing the value added tax paid shall be submitted together with the application. The original copy of the said invoice/receipt, however, shall be presented for cancellation prior to the issuance of the Tax Credit Certificate or refund. In addition, the following documents shall be attached whenever applicable:

1. Export Sales

i) Photocopy of export document showing the amount of export, the date and destination of the goods exported. With respect to foreign currency denominated sale, the photocopy of the invoice or receipt evidencing the sale of the goods, as well as the name of the person to whom the goods were delivered.

ii) Statement from the Central Bank or any of its accredited agent banks that the proceeds of the sale in acceptable foreign currency has been inwardly remitted and accounted for in accordance with applicable banking regulations.

In all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.

The CTA, applying the abovementioned rules, in its Decision dated August 24, 1998, came out with the following factual findings:

The formal offer of evidence of the petitioner failed to include photocopy of its export documents, as required. There is no way therefore, in determining the kind of goods and actual amount of export sales it allegedly made during the quarter involved. This finding is very crucial when we try to relate it with the requirement of the aforementioned regulations that the input tax being claimed for refund or tax credit must be shown to be entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction, in this case, export sales of goods. Without the export documents, the purchase invoice/receipts submitted by the petitioner as proof of its input taxes cannot be verified as being directly attributable to the goods so exported.

Lastly, We cannot grant petitioner’s claim for credit or refund of input taxes due to its failure to show convincingly that the same has not been applied to any of its output tax liability as provided under Section 106 (a) of the Tax Code. There is no evidence to show that the amount herein claimed for refund when applied for on January 25, 1996 has not been priorly or thereafter applied to its output tax liability.

The above factual findings of the CTA were even bolstered when it granted petitioner’s motion for reconsideration allowing petitioner to submit the necessary documents and other pieces of evidence, so as to comply with the requirements provided for by law. However, despite such allowance, petitioner still failed to comply. Thus, in its Resolution dated June 21, 2000, the CTA finally disposed the case by ruling that:

The Court finds and so holds that Petitioner failed again to present proof that it has not applied the alleged excess input taxes to any of its subsequent quarter’s output tax liability. In this Court’s decision dated August 24, 1998, We already mentioned that petitioner failed to convince us that its input taxes have not been applied to any of its output tax liability as provided under Section 106 (a). Now on its second opportunity to substantiate its claim, Petitioner again failed to prove this particular allegation. Petitioner merely presented in evidence the following documents to show that it has not applied the amount of P4,534,933.74, subject of the claim, to its 1994 first quarter output tax liability[.]

The above factual findings were affirmed and accorded respect by the CA. Nevertheless, petitioner insists that it has submitted documents and other pieces of evidence, except those required by law, that would establish the existence of the input VAT for the fourth quarter of 1993 and that the excess input VAT claimed for refund or tax credit has not been applied to its output tax liability for prior and succeeding quarters.

The above argument, however, is flawed. It must be remembered that when claiming tax refund/credit, the VAT-­registered taxpayer must be able to establish that it does have refundable or creditable input VAT, and the same has not been applied against its output VAT liabilities — information which are supposed to be reflected in the taxpayer’s VAT returns. Thus, an application for tax refund/credit must be accompanied by copies of the taxpayer’s VAT return/s for the taxable quarter/s concerned. The CTA and the CA, based on their appreciation of the evidence presented, committed no error when they declared that petitioner failed to prove that it is entitled to a tax refund and this Court, not being a trier of facts, must defer to their findings. [40]

To be sure, the courts a quo made no categorical pronouncement on the requirement of direct and entire attributability of input VAT to the zero­ rated sales or the effectively zero-rated transactions. Upon reconsideration, the CTA was satisfied that Atlas had input VAT for the fourth quarter of 1993. However, despite the additional pieces of evidence submitted by it, Atlas still failed to prove that it had not applied the excess input VAT claimed for refund or tax credit to its output tax liability for prior and succeeding quarters. The CTA’s Resolution made no mention on the requirement of attributability in denying Atlas’ claim. Instead, the courts a quo made an exhaustive discussion on petitioner’s failure to “present proof that it has not applied the alleged excess input taxes to any of its subsequent quarter’s output tax liability.”

Thus, when the case reached this Court, the Court stressed that “an application for tax refund/credit must be accompanied by copies of the taxpayer’s VAT return/s for the taxable quarters concerned”—documents proving that the input tax has not been applied to any of its output tax liability. In promulgating the Atlas decision, the Court did not categorically require direct and entire attributability of input taxes to zero-rated or effectively zero-­rated transactions. Surely, it did not even touch upon or rule on the matter. The requirement of proving that input taxes subject of a claim for refund or the issuance of tax credit certificate had not been applied to the taxpayer’s output tax liability was merely emphasized.

Meanwhile, in Team Sual, herein petitioner alleged that the taxpayer failed to submit all the documents enumerated in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98[41] and, as a consequence, the 120-day period given for it to decide, under Section 112(c) of the Tax Code, did not commence. Simply stated, the issue for the Court’s resolution was whether failure to submit the documents under Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98 interrupts the running of the 120-day period. In denying the petition, the Court disposed in this wise:

We adopt the above-mentioned findings of fact of the CTA Special First Division, as affirmed by the CTA EB. Whether TSC complied with the substantiation requirements of Section 112 of the NIRC and RR 3-88 is a question of fact, which could only be answered after reviewing, examining, evaluating, or weighing all over again the probative value of the evidence before the CTA, which this Court does not have reason to do in the present petition for review on certiorari. The findings of fact of the CTA are not to be disturbed unless clearly shown to be unsupported by substantial evidence. Since by the very nature of its functions, the CTA has developed an expertise on this subject, the Court will not set aside lightly the conclusions reached by them, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.

The CIR, however, insists that TSC failed to submit the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98. Thus, the 120-day period given for it to decide allegedly did not commence.

The CIR’s reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced. There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of a refund or credit of input VAT. The subject of RMO 53-98 states that it is a “Checklist of Documents to be Submitted by a Taxpayer upon Audit of his Tax Liabilities….” In this case, TSC was applying for a grant of refund or credit of its input tax. There was no allegation of an audit being conducted by the CIR. Even assuming that RMO 53-98 applies, it specifically states that some documents are required to be submitted by the taxpayer “if applicable”.

Moreover, if TSC indeed failed to submit the complete documents in support of its application, the CIR could have informed TSC of its failure, consistent with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 42-03. However, the CIR did not inform TSC of the document it failed to submit, even up to the present petition. The CIR likewise raised the issue of TSC’s alleged failure to submit the complete documents only in its motion for reconsideration of the CTA Special First Division’s 4 March 2010 Decision. Accordingly, we affirm the CTA EB’s finding that TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, and submitted the complete documents in support of its application for refund or credit of its input tax at the same time.

Under Section 112 (C) of the NIRC, in case of failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application, the taxpayer affected may, within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period, appeal the unacted claim with the CTA. The charter of the CTA also expressly provides that if the Commissioner fails to decide within “a specific period” required by law, such “inaction shall be deemed a denial” of the application for tax refund or credit. In Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. San Roque Power Corporation, we emphasized that compliance with the 120-day waiting period is mandatory and jurisdictional. In this case, when TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, the CIR had a period of 120 days, or until 20 April 2006, to act on the claim. However, the CIR failed to act on TSC’s claim within this 120-day period. Thus, TSC filed its petition for review with the CTA on 24 April 2006 or within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Accordingly, we do not find merit in the CIR’s argument that the judicial claim was prematurely filed.[42]

The Court ruled that petitioner was applying for a claim for refund, and that Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98 did not apply. As a result, the taxpayer filed its administrative claim and submitted the supporting documents on the same date. The Court held that the taxpayer correctly filed its petition with the CTA within 30-days-after the expiration of the 120-period from the filing of the administrative claim which the CIR failed to act on.

The Team Sual, as with the Atlas, made no pronouncement on the requirement of direct and entire attributability of input taxes in claims for refund and issuance of tax credit certificate. In both cases, the Court’s discussions never touched upon the issue of direct and entire attribution of input taxes as it was never raised as an issue. While the Court cited the provision of Revenue Regulations Nos. 3-88 and 5-87, no categorical pronouncements as to this requirement was made. Any issue, whether raised or not by the parties, but not passed upon by the Court, does not have any value as precedent.[43] Petitioner cannot, therefore, invoke these cases as legal bases to impress upon this Court the direct and entire attributability requirement of input taxes in claims for refund and issuance of tax credit certificate.

This Court shall proceed to examine the provisions of Revenue Regulation No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, which petitioner invokes.

Pursuant to Section 245,[44] in relation to Section 4,[45] of the 1997 Tax Code, the Secretary of Finance promulgated on September 1, 1987 Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88. The revenue regulations implemented the provisions of the law imposing VAT on importation of goods and sale of goods and services. Section 16(a) of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87 reads:

Sec. 16. Refunds or tax credits of input tax. —

(a) Zero-rated sales of goods and services. — Only a VAT­-registered person may be granted a tax credit or refund of value-added taxes paid corresponding to the zero-rated sales of goods or services, to the extent that such taxes have not been applied against output taxes, upon showing of proof of compliance with the conditions stated in Section 8 of these Regulations. cd

In all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of the value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.

Where the applicant is engaged in zero-rated and other taxable and exempt sales of goods or services, and the VAT paid (inputs) on purchases of goods and services cannot be directly attributed to any of the aforementioned transactions, the following formula shall be used to determine the creditable or refundable input tax for zero-rated sale:

Amount of Zero-rated Sale Total Sale
Total Sales
X
Total Amount of Input Taxes
=Amount Creditable/Refundable
On its face, it appears that the revenue regulations limited that amount of refund of input taxes to those paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction. However, this Court takes note of the guidelines in the determination of refundable or creditable input taxes as contained in Revenue Regulations No. 9-89.[46] Interestingly, petitioner failed to mention Revenue Regulations No. 9-89 which is similarly applicable to the instant Petition. The guidelines read:

SECTION 3. Section 16 of RR No. 5-87, as amended by RR 3-88, is further amended by adding a new paragraph to be known as Section 16(c)(6); to read as follows:

Section 16(C)(6). Determination of attributable input tax. – In general, the amount of refund or tax credit shall be limited to the amount of the value added tax (VAT) paid attributable to zero-rated transactions during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.

Purely zero-rated transactions. Where the applicant is exclusively engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions, he shall be entitled to the entire amount of the value-added tax paid on purchases of goods and services, as well as on importations, notwithstanding the existence of an inventory of goods at the end of the quarter in which the zero-rated transactions were made, subject to the submission of a sworn statement attesting to the subsequent actual exportation or consumption of goods in the inventory and supported by appropriate export documents.

For purposes of this paragraph, a VAT-registered person shall be considered as exclusively engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions if there are no taxable or exempt sales not only during the quarter covered by the claim but also that of the immediately preceding last three quarters prior to the claim. Incidental sales of obsolete or non-­moving supplies, equipment, “scraps”, and by-products of processed, manufactured or milled goods, etc., which are shown to have been subjected to value-added tax, shall not be considered for purposes of determining if the VAT registered person shall be considered as exclusively engaged in zero-rated of effectively zero-rated transactions.[47]

Recognizing the confusion that might have stemmed from its previous pronouncements in Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, as amended, the Secretary of Finance promulgated guidelines in the determination of refundable/creditable input taxes attributable to zero-rated transactions. In effect, Revenue Regulations No. 9-89 explicitly stated that taxpayers engaged in purely zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions may apply for the refund or credit of the entire amount of input tax paid on the purchases of goods and services in the quarter in which the transactions were made.

Thus, contrary to petitioner’s notion, the applicable regulations at the time respondent filed its claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate do not require direct and entire attributability of input taxes.

Tellingly, the CTA En Banc erred when it held that the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88 and Revenue Regulations No. 9-89, were inapplicable to the case at bench. However, despite the misapplication of law and regulations, this Court nevertheless agrees with the conclusion reached by the CTA En Banc.

Still, the basic tenet remains: direct and entire attributability of the input taxes is not required in claims for tax refund and issuance of tax credit certificate. Thusly, the only requisites for a claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of unutilized input taxes, as laid down in the Court’s earlier ruling involving respondent in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Toledo Power Co. (Toeldo Power)[48] are as follows:

1)
The taxpayer-claimant is VAT-registered;
2)
The claimant is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;
3)
There are creditable input taxes due or paid attributable to the zero­-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;
4)
The input taxes have not been applied against the output tax; and
5)
The application and the claim for a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate have been filed within the prescribed period.[49]
As to question of fact

Petitioner raises the question – Did respondent present sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate?

In the determination of whether respondent is entitled to tax refund or tax credit certificate, the CTA examined the documents it had submitted on the parameters laid down in Toledo Power. As a specialized court dedicated to the consideration of tax problems, the CTA has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject. Consequently, its factual findings when supported by substantial evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal. Unless there has been an abuse of discretion on its part, the Court accords the highest respect to the factual findings of the CTA.[50] Its conclusions will not be overturned unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.[51]

However, the rule admits of the following recognized exceptions applicable to tax cases: 1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) where there is a grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; 6) when the CTA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both petitioner and respondent; 7) the findings of the CTA En Banc are contrary to those of the CTA Division; 8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner’s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and 10) the finding of fact of the CTA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and 1s contradicted by the evidence on record.[52]

To be clear, the burden of showing convincing evidence that the appeal falls under one of the exceptions remains on the party filing the petition. A mere assertion is not sufficient.[53]

In the case at bench, both the CTA Special First Division and CTA En Banc ruled that respondent is entitled to claim a refund or credit of its unutilized input value-added attributable to its zero-rated sales of electricity to National Power Corporation but only to the extent of P399,550.84.[54]

The CTA Special First Division referred to the documents respondent submitted in determining the input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales. These documents were likewise examined by the court-commissioned independent certified public accountant. The court based its findings upon after a careful examination of all pieces of evidence presented by respondent, including supplier’s invoices, official receipts, Bureau of Customs’ Import Entries and Internal Revenue Declaration, and bank official receipts. It found that respondent was able to establish entitled to tax refund or credit in the amount of P399,550.84.[55] These findings were affirmed by the CTA En Banc.[56]

In questioning the findings of the CTA, petitioner raises questions of fact. To determine whether respondent is entitled to its claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for unutilized input VAT requires an evaluation of the documents and other evidence submitted during trial. Consequently, it becomes incumbent upon petitioner to prove that the listed exceptions are present in this case. Yet it failed to do so.

Although the CTA En Banc failed to apply the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended, it nevertheless applied the correct principle of the law and regulations. In its appreciation of the evidence submitted before it, the CTA. Special First Division examined these documents vis-à-vis the requirements under the foregoing disquisition and was convinced of sufficient proof for respondent’s claim. Moreover, the CTA En Banc did not impose additional requirements not sanctioned by Section 112 of the Tax Code and Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended.

In précis, this Court finds no reason to disturb the factual findings and conclusions reached by the CTA.

IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated July 23, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 12, 2021 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in the consolidated cases docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000 are AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.

Caguioa (Chairperson), Inting, Gaerlan, and Singh, JJ., concur.","Via this Petition for Review on Certiorari,[1] the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (petitioner) assails the Decision[2] and the Resolution[3] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc, affirming the adjudication of its Special First Division[4] and denying the motion for reconsideration thereof, respectively, in the consolidated cases docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000. The CTA Special First Division ordered the refund or the issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P399,550.84 in favor of Toledo Power Company (respondent), representing its unutilized input value-added tax (VAT) for the first quarter of taxable year (TY) 2003.
Stripped of unnecessary verbiage, the facts of the case follow:

Petitioner is the duly appointed Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) empowered to perform the duties of its office, including the power to decide refunds of internal revenue taxes.[5]

Respondent, on the other hand, a general partnership duly registered and existing under Philippine laws, is engaged in the business of power generation and the subsequent sale of generated power to the National Power Corporation, the Cebu Electric Cooperative III, and the Visayan Electric Company, Inc. As a VAT taxpayer, respondent is registered with the BIR, which released to it Tax Identification Number 003-883-626 and Certificate of Registration Revenue District Office (RDO) Control No. 94-083-000300.[6]","Through the instant Petition, petitioner raises issues, which can be summed in two:
One, did the CTA En Banc correctly interpret and apply the law and jurisprudence to the case at bench?

Two, did respondent present sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate?[22]

Petitioner contends that the CTA En Banc erred in holding that respondent established its entitlement to P399,550.84 worth of unutilized input tax for the first quarter of 2003. Section 112 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997[23] (Tax Code) does not dispense with the requirement that unutilized input taxes be directly attributable to a taxpayer’s zero-rated sales. Here, respondent had the burden of establishing the attributability of its unutilized input tax to its zero-rated sales transactions in order to qualify for a tax refund or credit under Section 112 of the Tax Code. Moreover, existing laws at the time respondent applied for refund of its alleged unutilized input tax required direct and entire attribution to its zero-rated sales.[24] To bolster its claim, petitioner invokes the Court’s rulings in Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR[25] (Atlas Case) and CIR v. Team Sual Corporation[26] (Team Sual Case).[27]

For its part, respondent posits that the CTA En Banc correctly upheld that law does not require a claimant for refund or tax credit to prove that the input tax is directly attributable to its zero-rated transactions and which are directly attributable to its taxable transactions. In any case, the determination of its entitlement to refund of input tax is a question of fact that is beyond the scope of a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[28]","On April 22, 2005, respondent filed with the CTA Special First Division a judicial claim for the refund or issuance of tax credit certificate in the amount of P3,907,783.80. This represented the unutilized input VAT from its domestic purchases of goods and services and importation of goods attributable to zero-rated sales for the first quarter of TY 2003. The petition was docketed as CTA Case No. 7233.[7] As it happened, the CTA Special First Division initially granted respondent’s claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate.[8] However, upon motion for reconsideration of both parties, respondent’s petition was dismissed pursuant to the Court’s pronouncements in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc. (Aichi).[9]

Before the CTA En Banc, respondent sought recourse on the dismissal of its petition.[10] However, the CTA En Banc affirmed the ruling of its Special First Division applying the case in Aichi that the petition was prematurely filed.[11]
Respondent’s bid for a reconsideration of the foregoing having been denied, it filed a petition for review before the Court praying for the reversal of the CTA En Banc‘s disposition.[12]

In disposing the case, the Court partially granted respondent’s petition and remanded the case to the CTA Special First Division for computation of refundable input VAT, viz.

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition in G.R. No. 195175 is DENIED, while the Petition in G.R. No. 199645 is PARTLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the case in G.R. No. 199645 is hereby REMANDED to the Court of Tax Appeals insofar as the Petition in [CTA] Case No. 7233, for the purpose of the computation of the refundable input VAT attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales of [respondent] for the first quarter of 2003.

SO ORDERED.[13]


Accordingly, the CTA En Banc remanded CTA Case No. 7233 to its Special First Division for the computation of respondent’s input VAT attributable to zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales for the first quarter of 2003.[14]
On July 13, 2018, the Special First Division rendered an Amended Decision[15] partially granting respondent’s claim for refund in the amount of P399,550.84, and disposed in this wise:

WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing considerations, the Petition for Review filed by [respondent] vs. [petitioner] in CTA Case No. 7233 is hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the [petitioner] is hereby ORDERED TO REFUND or TO ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE in favor of [respondent] in the amount of THREE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY PERSOS AND EIGHTY-FOUR CENTAVOS ([PHP] 399,550.84), representing its unutilized input VAT first quarter of taxable year 2003.

SO ORDERED.[16]

Displeased, both parties moved for partial reconsideration,[17] which the CTA Third Division denied for lack of merit, viz.:

“WHEREFORE, premises considered, [petitioner]’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration (Re: Decision promulgated 13 July 2018) and [respondent]’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration (Re: Amended Decision dated July 13, 2018) are DENIED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.“[18]

Unruffled, both parties elevated the case to the CTA En Banc, docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000. Eventually, the cases were consolidated.[19]

In the impugned Decision, the CTA En Banc decreed, inter alia, that there was no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the CTA Division. Thus, the consolidated petitions were denied—

WHEREFORE, the Petitions for Review are DENIED for lack of merit. The Amended Decision dated July 13, 2018 and Resolution dated December 19, 2018 are AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[20]

Petitioner moved anew for the reconsideration of the foregoing Decision, which the CTA En Banc ultimately denied in the challenged Resolution.[21]

Preliminarily, the Court emphasizes that it is not a trier of facts. Only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[29] Questions of fact are generally proscribed.[30]

A petition raising questions of law is one which raises doubts as to what the law is on a certain state of facts as opposed to a petition raising a question of fact which occurs when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them.[31]

In claims for tax refunds, this Court distinguished a question of law from a question of fact as follows:

[xxx] the proper interpretation of the provision on tax refund that does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties-litigants is a question of law. Conversely, it may be said that if the appeal essentially calls for the re-examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the appellant, the same raises a question of fact. Often repeated is the distinction that there is a question of law in a given case when doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts; there is a question of fact when doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts.

Verily, the sufficiency of a claimant’s evidence and the determination of the amount of refund, as called for in this case, are questions of fact, which are for the judicious determination by the CTA of the evidence on record.[32]

Mixed questions of fact and law are raised in the case at bench. For one, whether respondent presented sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate is a question of fact. For another, the issue on the correct interpretation and application of law and jurisprudence is a question of law.

As to the question of law

The Court emphasizes that the applicable law to the instant Petition is the Tax Code in view of the principle of prospective application of tax laws.[33] Here, respondent’s claim for tax refund and issuance of tax credit certificate of its unutilized input taxes for the first quarter of TY 2003 was filed with the CTA on April 22, 2005. Meanwhile, the amendments brought forth by Republic Act (RA) No. 9337[34] took effect on July 1, 2005 or more than two months after respondent filed the judicial claim subject of this case. Thusly, the instant Petition shall be examined based on the parameters of the Tax Code, prior to any amendments brought by RA No. 9337, and its effective implementing rules and regulations.

Section 112(A) of the Tax Code provides for the requirements for refund and tax credits of input taxes, viz.

Section 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. – 
 

(A)
Zero-Rated or Effectively Zero-Rated Sales. – Any VAT-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in the case of zero-rated sales under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1), (2) and (b) and Section 108(B)(1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof had been duly accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the an1ount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales.
Elsewise stated, a VAT-registered person engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales may apply for a claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for its creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales. However, the input taxes must have not been applied to any output taxes. Moreover, the application or claim must be made within two years after the close of the quarter when the sales were made. Mere semblance of attribution to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales would suffice.

Contrary to petitioner’s allegation, the Tax Code does not require direct and entire attribution of input taxes to the zero-rated or effectively zero­-rated sales before it may be made subject of a tax refund or claim for tax credit certificate. In fact, the law only mentions the phrase “directly and entirely” in reference to mixed transactions or in cases where the taxpayer is engaged in both zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales and VAT-taxable or VAT-exempt sales—such that input taxes which cannot be directly and entirely attributed to specific transactions shall be allocated based on the sales volume of each transaction.

The word attribute means to explain something by indicating a cause.[35] Thus, when the law states that the input VAT must be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, it simply means that the input VAT must be incurred on a purchase or importation which causes or relates to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales but not necessarily a part of the finished goods subject of such sales.

Based on this parameter, the input taxes of taxpayers engaged purely in either zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions are presumably attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated activity as they are not engaged in any other category for VAT purposes. All its purchases of goods and services are made in relation to or caused by its zero-rated or effectively zero-rated activities. Otherwise, how else would the taxpayer utilize its purchase but for its main activity which, incidentally in this case, is a zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transaction? The remaining requirement for it to claim refund or tax credit certificate for unutilized input tax are the documentary requirements and the period within which the same must be filed.

Meanwhile, taxpayers engaged in mixed transactions must first categorize its input taxes. Those which can be directly and entirely attributed to VAT-taxable transactions, VAT-exempt transaction, zero-rated transactions, and effectively zero-rated transactions shall first be applied to the respective output tax resulting from such transaction. Thereafter, residual input taxes, or input tax which “cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, [xxx] shall be allocated to any one of the transactions [xxx] proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales.” Simply stated, even if the input VAT cannot be directly and entirely allocated in any of these transactions, the taxpayer may still apply the input VAT proportionately based on the volume of the transactions. This is so because requirement of direct and entire attributability only applies in mixed transactions and only to the extent that input taxes can be attributed as a particular transaction.

This interpretation is further bolstered when juxtaposed with the definition of creditable input taxes under Section 110 of the Tax Code and the effective revenue regulations at the time.

Section 110 of the Tax Code provides:

Section 110. Tax Credits. 

b. Creditable Input Tax. 

(b)
Any input tax evidenced by a VAT invoice or official receipt issued in accordance with Section 113 hereof on the following transactions shall be creditable against the output tax:
(b)
Purchase or importation of goods:
(b)
For sale; or
(ii)
For conversion into or intended to form part of a finished product for sale including packaging materials; or
(iii)
For use as supplies in the course of business; or
(iv)
For use as materials supplied in the sale of service; or
(v)
For use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation or amortization is allowed under this Code, except automobiles, aircraft and yachts.
(b)
Purchase of services on which a value-added tax has been actually paid.
(2)
The input tax on domestic purchase of goods or properties shall be creditable:
(b)
To the purchaser upon consummation of sale and on importation of goods or properties; and
(b)
To the importer upon payment of the value-added tax prior to the release of the goods from the custody of the Bureau of Customs.
Provided, that the input tax on goods purchased or imported in a calendar month for use in trade or business for which deduction for depreciation is allowed under this Code shall be spread evenly over the a month of acquisition and the fifty-nine (59) succeeding months if the aggregate acquisition cost for such goods, excluding the VAT component thereof, exceeds One million pesos (P1,000,000): Provided, however, That if the estimated useful life of the capital good is less than five (5) years, as used for depreciation purposes, then the input VAT shall be spread over such a shorter period: Provided, further, That the amortization of the input VAT shall only be allowed until December 31, 2021 after which taxpayers with unutilized input VAT on capital goods purchased or imported shall be allowed to apply the same as scheduled until fully utilized: Provided, finally, That in the case of purchase of services, lease or use of properties, the input tax shall be creditable to the purchaser, lessee or licensee upon payment of the compensation, rental, royalty or free.
(3)
A VAT-registered person who is also engaged in transactions not subject to the value-added tax shall be allowed tax credit as follows:
(b)
Total input tax which can be directly attributed to transactions subject to value-added tax; and
(b)
A ratable portion of any input tax which cannot be directly attributed to either activity.
The term “input tax” means the value-added tax due from or paid by a VAT-registered person in the course of his trade or business on importation of goods or local purchase of goods or services, including lease or use of property, from a VAT-registered person. It shall also include the transitional input tax determined in accordance with Section 111 of this Code.

The term “output tax” means the value-added tax due on the sale or lease of taxable goods or properties or services by any person registered or required to register under Section 236 of this Code.

Contrary to petitioner’s submission, creditable input taxes go beyond taxes on purchases of goods that form part of the finished product of the taxpayer or those which are directly used in the chain of production. The Tax Code did not limit creditable input taxes to those incurred on purchases which ultimately find its way to taxpayer’s finished products for sale. Input taxes incurred on other purchases may still be credited against output tax liability. Despite not forming part of the finished goods, Section 110 treats as creditable those input tax due from or paid in the course of their trade or business on the importation of goods or local purchase of goods or services, including lease or use of property, from a VAT-registered person. Surely, even if the purchased goods do not find their way into the taxpayer’s finished product, the input tax incurred therefrom can still be credited against the output tax if it is (1) incurred or paid in the course of the VAT-registered taxpayer’s trade or business, and (2) supported by a VAT invoice issued in accordance with the invoicing requirements of the law.

Along this grain, the Court takes this opportunity to clarify its earlier rulings in Atlas[36] and Team Sual[37] which petitioner cites in support of its position.

In Atlas, petitioner Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (Atlas) applied for a tax refund or a tax credit certificate with herein petitioner in the amount of P842,336,291.60 representing its excess VAT credit of the fourth quarter of 1994. On the same date, it also filed a claim for refund with the CTA.

As it happened, the CTA denied Atlas’ claim for failure to comply with the documentary requirements under Section 16 of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87[38], as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88.[39] Upon reconsideration, the CTA allowed Atlas to present additional documents together with its proof of non-availment for prior and succeeding quarters of the input VAT subject of its claim for refund. Still and all, the CTA denied the claim and ruled that Atlas failed to substantiate its claim that it has not applied its alleged excess input taxes to any of its subsequent quarter’s output tax liability.

Atlas elevated its case to the Court via a petition for review on certiorari insisting that it submitted pieces of evidence other than those required by law which would establish the existence of the input VAT and that the same had not been applied to its output tax liability. In denying the petition, the Court, not being a trier of facts, deferred to the factual findings of the CTA and the Court of Appeals, viz. —

In the present case, petitioner is basically asking this Court to review the factual findings of the CTA and the CA. Petitioner insists that it had presented the necessary documents or copies thereof with the CTA that would prove that it is entitled to a tax refund. [xxx] Again, citing the earlier case of Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR, this Court has expounded the nature and bases of claiming tax refund[.]



As to the evidence that must be presented, the provisions of the pertinent laws provide:

Section 106, Tax Code

Refunds or tax credits of input tax. — (a) Any VAT­-registered person, whose sales are zero-rated, may, within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales, except transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against output tax: Provided, however, That in case of zero-rated sales under Section 100 (a) (2) (A) (I), (ii) and (b) and Section 102 (b) (1) and (2), the acceptable foreign currency exchange proceeds thereof have been duly accounted for in accordance with the regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP): Provided, further, That where the taxpayer is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale and also in taxable or exempt sale of goods or properties or services, and the amount of creditable input tax due or paid cannot be directly and entirely attributed to any one of the transactions, it shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the volume of sales.

Section 16 of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, dated April 7, 1988

A photocopy of the purchase invoice or receipt evidencing the value added tax paid shall be submitted together with the application. The original copy of the said invoice/receipt, however, shall be presented for cancellation prior to the issuance of the Tax Credit Certificate or refund. In addition, the following documents shall be attached whenever applicable:

1. Export Sales

i) Photocopy of export document showing the amount of export, the date and destination of the goods exported. With respect to foreign currency denominated sale, the photocopy of the invoice or receipt evidencing the sale of the goods, as well as the name of the person to whom the goods were delivered.

ii) Statement from the Central Bank or any of its accredited agent banks that the proceeds of the sale in acceptable foreign currency has been inwardly remitted and accounted for in accordance with applicable banking regulations.



In all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.

The CTA, applying the abovementioned rules, in its Decision dated August 24, 1998, came out with the following factual findings:

The formal offer of evidence of the petitioner failed to include photocopy of its export documents, as required. There is no way therefore, in determining the kind of goods and actual amount of export sales it allegedly made during the quarter involved. This finding is very crucial when we try to relate it with the requirement of the aforementioned regulations that the input tax being claimed for refund or tax credit must be shown to be entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction, in this case, export sales of goods. Without the export documents, the purchase invoice/receipts submitted by the petitioner as proof of its input taxes cannot be verified as being directly attributable to the goods so exported.

Lastly, We cannot grant petitioner’s claim for credit or refund of input taxes due to its failure to show convincingly that the same has not been applied to any of its output tax liability as provided under Section 106 (a) of the Tax Code. There is no evidence to show that the amount herein claimed for refund when applied for on January 25, 1996 has not been priorly or thereafter applied to its output tax liability.

The above factual findings of the CTA were even bolstered when it granted petitioner’s motion for reconsideration allowing petitioner to submit the necessary documents and other pieces of evidence, so as to comply with the requirements provided for by law. However, despite such allowance, petitioner still failed to comply. Thus, in its Resolution dated June 21, 2000, the CTA finally disposed the case by ruling that:

The Court finds and so holds that Petitioner failed again to present proof that it has not applied the alleged excess input taxes to any of its subsequent quarter’s output tax liability. In this Court’s decision dated August 24, 1998, We already mentioned that petitioner failed to convince us that its input taxes have not been applied to any of its output tax liability as provided under Section 106 (a). Now on its second opportunity to substantiate its claim, Petitioner again failed to prove this particular allegation. Petitioner merely presented in evidence the following documents to show that it has not applied the amount of P4,534,933.74, subject of the claim, to its 1994 first quarter output tax liability[.]



The above factual findings were affirmed and accorded respect by the CA. Nevertheless, petitioner insists that it has submitted documents and other pieces of evidence, except those required by law, that would establish the existence of the input VAT for the fourth quarter of 1993 and that the excess input VAT claimed for refund or tax credit has not been applied to its output tax liability for prior and succeeding quarters.

The above argument, however, is flawed. It must be remembered that when claiming tax refund/credit, the VAT-­registered taxpayer must be able to establish that it does have refundable or creditable input VAT, and the same has not been applied against its output VAT liabilities — information which are supposed to be reflected in the taxpayer’s VAT returns. Thus, an application for tax refund/credit must be accompanied by copies of the taxpayer’s VAT return/s for the taxable quarter/s concerned. The CTA and the CA, based on their appreciation of the evidence presented, committed no error when they declared that petitioner failed to prove that it is entitled to a tax refund and this Court, not being a trier of facts, must defer to their findings. x x x[40]

To be sure, the courts a quo made no categorical pronouncement on the requirement of direct and entire attributability of input VAT to the zero­ rated sales or the effectively zero-rated transactions. Upon reconsideration, the CTA was satisfied that Atlas had input VAT for the fourth quarter of 1993. However, despite the additional pieces of evidence submitted by it, Atlas still failed to prove that it had not applied the excess input VAT claimed for refund or tax credit to its output tax liability for prior and succeeding quarters. The CTA’s Resolution made no mention on the requirement of attributability in denying Atlas’ claim. Instead, the courts a quo made an exhaustive discussion on petitioner’s failure to “present proof that it has not applied the alleged excess input taxes to any of its subsequent quarter’s output tax liability.”

Thus, when the case reached this Court, the Court stressed that “an application for tax refund/credit must be accompanied by copies of the taxpayer’s VAT return/s for the taxable quarters concerned”—documents proving that the input tax has not been applied to any of its output tax liability. In promulgating the Atlas decision, the Court did not categorically require direct and entire attributability of input taxes to zero-rated or effectively zero-­rated transactions. Surely, it did not even touch upon or rule on the matter. The requirement of proving that input taxes subject of a claim for refund or the issuance of tax credit certificate had not been applied to the taxpayer’s output tax liability was merely emphasized.

Meanwhile, in Team Sual, herein petitioner alleged that the taxpayer failed to submit all the documents enumerated in Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98[41] and, as a consequence, the 120-day period given for it to decide, under Section 112(c) of the Tax Code, did not commence. Simply stated, the issue for the Court’s resolution was whether failure to submit the documents under Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98 interrupts the running of the 120-day period. In denying the petition, the Court disposed in this wise:

We adopt the above-mentioned findings of fact of the CTA Special First Division, as affirmed by the CTA EB. Whether TSC complied with the substantiation requirements of Section 112 of the NIRC and RR 3-88 is a question of fact, which could only be answered after reviewing, examining, evaluating, or weighing all over again the probative value of the evidence before the CTA, which this Court does not have reason to do in the present petition for review on certiorari. The findings of fact of the CTA are not to be disturbed unless clearly shown to be unsupported by substantial evidence. Since by the very nature of its functions, the CTA has developed an expertise on this subject, the Court will not set aside lightly the conclusions reached by them, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.

The CIR, however, insists that TSC failed to submit the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98. Thus, the 120-day period given for it to decide allegedly did not commence.

The CIR’s reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced. There is nothing in Section 112 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of a refund or credit of input VAT. The subject of RMO 53-98 states that it is a “Checklist of Documents to be Submitted by a Taxpayer upon Audit of his Tax Liabilities….” In this case, TSC was applying for a grant of refund or credit of its input tax. There was no allegation of an audit being conducted by the CIR. Even assuming that RMO 53-98 applies, it specifically states that some documents are required to be submitted by the taxpayer “if applicable”.

Moreover, if TSC indeed failed to submit the complete documents in support of its application, the CIR could have informed TSC of its failure, consistent with Revenue Memorandum Circular No. (RMC) 42-03. However, the CIR did not inform TSC of the document it failed to submit, even up to the present petition. The CIR likewise raised the issue of TSC’s alleged failure to submit the complete documents only in its motion for reconsideration of the CTA Special First Division’s 4 March 2010 Decision. Accordingly, we affirm the CTA EB’s finding that TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, and submitted the complete documents in support of its application for refund or credit of its input tax at the same time.

Under Section 112 (C) of the NIRC, in case of failure on the part of the CIR to act on the application, the taxpayer affected may, within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period, appeal the unacted claim with the CTA. The charter of the CTA also expressly provides that if the Commissioner fails to decide within “a specific period” required by law, such “inaction shall be deemed a denial” of the application for tax refund or credit. In Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. San Roque Power Corporation, we emphasized that compliance with the 120-day waiting period is mandatory and jurisdictional. In this case, when TSC filed its administrative claim on 21 December 2005, the CIR had a period of 120 days, or until 20 April 2006, to act on the claim. However, the CIR failed to act on TSC’s claim within this 120-day period. Thus, TSC filed its petition for review with the CTA on 24 April 2006 or within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Accordingly, we do not find merit in the CIR’s argument that the judicial claim was prematurely filed.[42]

The Court ruled that petitioner was applying for a claim for refund, and that Revenue Memorandum Order No. 53-98 did not apply. As a result, the taxpayer filed its administrative claim and submitted the supporting documents on the same date. The Court held that the taxpayer correctly filed its petition with the CTA within 30-days-after the expiration of the 120-period from the filing of the administrative claim which the CIR failed to act on.

The Team Sual, as with the Atlas, made no pronouncement on the requirement of direct and entire attributability of input taxes in claims for refund and issuance of tax credit certificate. In both cases, the Court’s discussions never touched upon the issue of direct and entire attribution of input taxes as it was never raised as an issue. While the Court cited the provision of Revenue Regulations Nos. 3-88 and 5-87, no categorical pronouncements as to this requirement was made. Any issue, whether raised or not by the parties, but not passed upon by the Court, does not have any value as precedent.[43] Petitioner cannot, therefore, invoke these cases as legal bases to impress upon this Court the direct and entire attributability requirement of input taxes in claims for refund and issuance of tax credit certificate.

This Court shall proceed to examine the provisions of Revenue Regulation No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, which petitioner invokes.

Pursuant to Section 245,[44] in relation to Section 4,[45] of the 1997 Tax Code, the Secretary of Finance promulgated on September 1, 1987 Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88. The revenue regulations implemented the provisions of the law imposing VAT on importation of goods and sale of goods and services. Section 16(a) of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87 reads:

Sec. 16. Refunds or tax credits of input tax. —

(a) Zero-rated sales of goods and services. — Only a VAT­-registered person may be granted a tax credit or refund of value-added taxes paid corresponding to the zero-rated sales of goods or services, to the extent that such taxes have not been applied against output taxes, upon showing of proof of compliance with the conditions stated in Section 8 of these Regulations. cd



In all cases, the amount of refund or tax credit that may be granted shall be limited to the amount of the value-added tax (VAT) paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.

Where the applicant is engaged in zero-rated and other taxable and exempt sales of goods or services, and the VAT paid (inputs) on purchases of goods and services cannot be directly attributed to any of the aforementioned transactions, the following formula shall be used to determine the creditable or refundable input tax for zero-rated sale:

Amount of Zero-rated Sale Total Sale
Total Sales
X
Total Amount of Input Taxes
=Amount Creditable/Refundable
On its face, it appears that the revenue regulations limited that amount of refund of input taxes to those paid directly and entirely attributable to the zero-rated transaction. However, this Court takes note of the guidelines in the determination of refundable or creditable input taxes as contained in Revenue Regulations No. 9-89.[46] Interestingly, petitioner failed to mention Revenue Regulations No. 9-89 which is similarly applicable to the instant Petition. The guidelines read:

SECTION 3. Section 16 of RR No. 5-87, as amended by RR 3-88, is further amended by adding a new paragraph to be known as Section 16(c)(6); to read as follows:

Section 16(C)(6). Determination of attributable input tax. – In general, the amount of refund or tax credit shall be limited to the amount of the value added tax (VAT) paid attributable to zero-rated transactions during the period covered by the application for credit or refund.

Purely zero-rated transactions. Where the applicant is exclusively engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions, he shall be entitled to the entire amount of the value-added tax paid on purchases of goods and services, as well as on importations, notwithstanding the existence of an inventory of goods at the end of the quarter in which the zero-rated transactions were made, subject to the submission of a sworn statement attesting to the subsequent actual exportation or consumption of goods in the inventory and supported by appropriate export documents.

For purposes of this paragraph, a VAT-registered person shall be considered as exclusively engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions if there are no taxable or exempt sales not only during the quarter covered by the claim but also that of the immediately preceding last three quarters prior to the claim. Incidental sales of obsolete or non-­moving supplies, equipment, “scraps”, and by-products of processed, manufactured or milled goods, etc., which are shown to have been subjected to value-added tax, shall not be considered for purposes of determining if the VAT registered person shall be considered as exclusively engaged in zero-rated of effectively zero-rated transactions.[47]

Recognizing the confusion that might have stemmed from its previous pronouncements in Revenue Regulations No. 3-88, as amended, the Secretary of Finance promulgated guidelines in the determination of refundable/creditable input taxes attributable to zero-rated transactions. In effect, Revenue Regulations No. 9-89 explicitly stated that taxpayers engaged in purely zero-rated or effectively zero-rated transactions may apply for the refund or credit of the entire amount of input tax paid on the purchases of goods and services in the quarter in which the transactions were made.

Thus, contrary to petitioner’s notion, the applicable regulations at the time respondent filed its claim for refund or issuance of tax credit certificate do not require direct and entire attributability of input taxes.

Tellingly, the CTA En Banc erred when it held that the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended by Revenue Regulations No. 3-88 and Revenue Regulations No. 9-89, were inapplicable to the case at bench. However, despite the misapplication of law and regulations, this Court nevertheless agrees with the conclusion reached by the CTA En Banc.

Still, the basic tenet remains: direct and entire attributability of the input taxes is not required in claims for tax refund and issuance of tax credit certificate. Thusly, the only requisites for a claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate of unutilized input taxes, as laid down in the Court’s earlier ruling involving respondent in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Toledo Power Co. (Toeldo Power)[48] are as follows:

1)
The taxpayer-claimant is VAT-registered;
2)
The claimant is engaged in zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;
3)
There are creditable input taxes due or paid attributable to the zero­-rated or effectively zero-rated sales;
4)
The input taxes have not been applied against the output tax; and
5)
The application and the claim for a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate have been filed within the prescribed period.[49]
As to question of fact

Petitioner raises the question – Did respondent present sufficient evidence for the grant of tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate?

In the determination of whether respondent is entitled to tax refund or tax credit certificate, the CTA examined the documents it had submitted on the parameters laid down in Toledo Power. As a specialized court dedicated to the consideration of tax problems, the CTA has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject. Consequently, its factual findings when supported by substantial evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal. Unless there has been an abuse of discretion on its part, the Court accords the highest respect to the factual findings of the CTA.[50] Its conclusions will not be overturned unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.[51]

However, the rule admits of the following recognized exceptions applicable to tax cases: 1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) where there is a grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; 6) when the CTA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both petitioner and respondent; 7) the findings of the CTA En Banc are contrary to those of the CTA Division; 8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner’s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and 10) the finding of fact of the CTA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and 1s contradicted by the evidence on record.[52]

To be clear, the burden of showing convincing evidence that the appeal falls under one of the exceptions remains on the party filing the petition. A mere assertion is not sufficient.[53]

In the case at bench, both the CTA Special First Division and CTA En Banc ruled that respondent is entitled to claim a refund or credit of its unutilized input value-added attributable to its zero-rated sales of electricity to National Power Corporation but only to the extent of P399,550.84.[54]

The CTA Special First Division referred to the documents respondent submitted in determining the input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales. These documents were likewise examined by the court-commissioned independent certified public accountant. The court based its findings upon after a careful examination of all pieces of evidence presented by respondent, including supplier’s invoices, official receipts, Bureau of Customs’ Import Entries and Internal Revenue Declaration, and bank official receipts. It found that respondent was able to establish entitled to tax refund or credit in the amount of P399,550.84.[55] These findings were affirmed by the CTA En Banc.[56]

In questioning the findings of the CTA, petitioner raises questions of fact. To determine whether respondent is entitled to its claim of refund or issuance of tax credit certificate for unutilized input VAT requires an evaluation of the documents and other evidence submitted during trial. Consequently, it becomes incumbent upon petitioner to prove that the listed exceptions are present in this case. Yet it failed to do so.

Although the CTA En Banc failed to apply the provisions of Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended, it nevertheless applied the correct principle of the law and regulations. In its appreciation of the evidence submitted before it, the CTA. Special First Division examined these documents vis-à-vis the requirements under the foregoing disquisition and was convinced of sufficient proof for respondent’s claim. Moreover, the CTA En Banc did not impose additional requirements not sanctioned by Section 112 of the Tax Code and Revenue Regulations No. 5-87, as amended.

In précis, this Court finds no reason to disturb the factual findings and conclusions reached by the CTA.

IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated July 23, 2020 and the Resolution dated January 12, 2021 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in the consolidated cases docketed as CTA EB Nos. 1990 and 2000 are AFFIRMED.

ANNALIZA C. SINGSON,* PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES NAR CHRISTIAN CARPIO AND CECILIA CAO CARPIO, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



GESMUNDO, C.J.:
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to modify the October 26, 2017 Decision[2] and the April 12, 2018 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 104327 which affirmed the November 4, 2014 Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 47 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 10-124055, granting the Complaint[5] for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of Real Property with Damages filed by spouses Nar Christian Carpio (Nar) and Cecilia Cao Carpio (collectively, respondents) against Enriquito C. Caamic (Enriquito) and Annaliza C. Singson (petitioner).


Respondents claim ownership over a 51.24-square meter land, including the two-storey residential house erected thereon situated at No. 22-E Block 5, De los Santos Street, Magsaysay Village, Tondo, Manila (subject property), and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 286305.[6] They acquired the said property from Primitiva Cayanan Vda. De Caamic (Primitiva) on February 16, 2007, and averred that since then, they had been religiously paying the realty taxes, as shown by official receipts for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.[7]
It appears that prior to and after the sale, petitioner and Primitiva had been occupying the subject property. However, after Primitiva died on July 21, 2007,[8] Enriquito, claiming to be her son and heir, suddenly surfaced and asserted his interest over the subject property. When petitioner and Enriquito refused to vacate the subject property despite repeated demands, respondents filed a complaint before their barangay for possible conciliation. Unfortunately, no amicable settlement was reached based on the certification to file action issued by the Lupong Tagapamayapa.[9]

Thus, on August 6, 2010, respondents filed a Complaint for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of Real Property with Damages and prayed that they be declared as lawful owners of the subject property and that Enriquito and petitioner be ordered to vacate the same. Respondents also urged the RTC to order Enriquito and petitioner to pay the following amounts: (1) monthly rental in the amount of P1,500.00 from July 2007 up to the time they actually vacate the premises; (2) P50,000.00 as moral damages; (3) P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; (4) P30,000.00 as attorney’s fees, plus P3,000.00 appearance fee per hearing; and (5) costs of suit.[10]

In her Answer,[11] petitioner claimed to be the grandniece of Primitiva and her husband, who took care of Primitiva during her lifetime. She also helped Primitiva secure a loan from respondents who were their neighbors, in the amount of P135,000.00 which Primitiva used to redeem the subject property from a certain Lordita Piamonte (Piamonte). While respondents agreed to loan the said amount, they made Primitiva and petitioner sign a notarized document entitled “Bilihan ng Lupa“[12] for assurance.[13]

Several months after Primitiva died, petitioner received through mail a document entitled “Kasunduan“[14] dated February 16, 2007 which indicated that Primitiva had sold the property to respondents for the amount of P450,000.00. Since it was the first time that petitioner saw the document, she informed her uncle, Enriquito, about it.[15]

When Enriquito arrived from the province, petitioner accompanied him to Atty. Richard Anolin (Atty. Anolin) who supposedly notarized the document. However, Atty. Anolin issued a Certification[16] indicating that he did not notarize a document entitled “Deed of Sale”[17] dated February 18, 2007 which appeared to have been executed by Primitiva and petitioner. This prompted petitioner and Enriquito to file a case for falsification against respondents before the City Prosecutor of Manila. While the case was in its preliminary investigation, respondents attempted to register the subject property under their names, but petitioner opposed the move. However, for unknown reasons, respondents had been successful in registering the subject property under their names on their third attempt.[18]

As part of her affirmative defense, petitioner asserted that Primitiva had no intention of relinquishing the subject property. She insisted that with the existence of the document Bilihan ng Lupa, respondents have no cause of action and that the transfer of the registration of the contested subject property to their names was done fraudulently.[19]

In their Reply,[20] respondents alleged that petitioner herself was a witness to the signing of the Bilihan ng Lupa. They were able to transfer the title to their names by going through the proper channels and government authorities, hence, there is no basis for petitioner’s claim of fraud. On the other hand, petitioner had not shown her entitlement to the property either as an heir, donee, vendee, or owner by prescription. Moreover, petitioner, in effect, was collaterally attacking the validity of their title, which she cannot do since Torrens titles are indefeasible and binding upon the whole world unless nullified by a court of competent jurisdiction.[21]

During trial, respondents presented only one witness, Nar, and submitted the following documentary evidence, namely: a certified true copy of TCT No. 286305 of the Register of Deeds of Manila; the declarations of real property value (land and building) in respondents’ names; the real estate tax receipt and real estate tax statement of account for the year 2013; the notice to vacate addressed to Enriquito and petitioner; the certification by the post office that the registered mail was duly received; and the certificate to file action issued by the Lupong Tagapamayapa.[22]

On the other hand, petitioner testified to support her claims and presented the following documents: a copy of the Bilihan ng Lupa; the death certificate of Primitiva; the certification of Atty. Anolin to the effect that the Deed of Sale allegedly executed by Primitiva and petitioner was a forgery; and her judicial affidavit.[23]

Meanwhile, on July 22, 2011, respondents filed a Manifestation and Motion to Drop Enriquito C. Caamic as Defendant,[24] averring that he had already vacated the subject property. On November 8, 2011, the RTC granted the motion and dropped Enriquito as party-defendant.[25]



In its November 4, 2014 Decision, the RTC decreed:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendant:

1. To vacate and voluntarily surrender possession of the subject house and lot located at No. 22-E Block 5, [D]e los Santos Street, Magsaysay Village, Tonda, Manila and covered by TCT No. 286305 upon [respondents];

2. To pay [respondents] the monthly rental of [P]1,500.00 due [to] her occupation of the premises and starting July 2007 until she has actually vacated the premises; and

3. To pay [respondents’] Attorney’s [f]ees m the amount of [P]30,000.00.

SO ORDERED.[26]

The RTC ruled that based on the evidence presented by both parties, particularly the document Bilihan ng Lupa, the transaction between them was a contract of sale with conventional redemption. It noted that the bone of contention between them is the provisions of such document on the vendor’s right to redeem or buyback the property within five years from the date of the instrument.[27]

Taking into account the terms and conditions of the document Bilihan ng Lupa and Articles 1601[28] and 1616[29] of the Civil Code, the RTC held that there was a valid transfer of ownership from the previous owner/vendor, Primitiva, to respondents. As such, respondents were not prohibited from registering the title in their names, but without prejudice to the right of Primitiva to redeem it within the agreed period. The RTC held that when Primitiva died in July of 2007, her right to redeem had also ended. Thus, when petitioner and Enriquito tried to redeem the subject property, they were already barred from doing so.[30]

Aggrieved, petitioner filed an Appeal,[31] assigning the lone error that the RTC gravely erred in holding that the Bilihan ng Lupa was a perfected contract of sale with conventional redemption.[32] She insisted that since the contract between Primitiva and respondents was an equitable mortgage, respondents’ remedy was either to recover the loaned amount by filing an action for sum of money or foreclosing the property.[33]

On October 26, 2017, the CA rendered a Decision affirming the RTC. It ruled that the Bilihan ng Lupa, is an equitable mortgage because: (1) Primitiva and petitioner remained in possession of the subject property despite the purchase; and (2) Primitiva was in dire need of money to redeem the subject property at the time of the transaction.[34]
The CA, however, held that regardless of the finding that the transaction was an equitable mortgage, petitioner cannot insist on the same because nobody had the right to redeem the contested realty. When Primitiva died, she had no known heirs to whom her rights and obligations could have been passed on. Even if petitioner may have been treated by Primitiva as her own daughter, she was only a distant relative and not a legal heir. Thus, the right of redemption did not pass unto her. Having failed to establish her legal personality to redeem the property, she is likewise found to have no personality to insist on the equitable mortgage.[35]

Furthermore, Enriquito, as the supposed heir of Primitiva, failed to present any convincing evidence to corroborate his claim other than his belated registration of birth certificate. He likewise failed to prove his right as an heir when he voluntarily did not participate during the proceedings of the case.[36]

The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed 4 November 2014 Decision of the RTC is AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[37]

Dissatisfied with the CA Decision, petitioner filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration.[38] In its Resolution dated April 12, 2018, the CA denied the motion. Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari.

Petitioner raises the sole issue of whether the CA gravely erred in affirming the RTC despite proof that the Bilihan ng Lupa is in the nature of a pactum commissorium.[39] Petitioner contends that the CA accorded respondents with the power to automatically appropriate the mortgaged property in the event of nonpayment. She insists that the ruling in Spouses Solitarios v. Spouses Jaque[40] squarely applies in the case at bench where the Court, despite finding that the deed of sale was an equitable mortgage, ruled that the transfer of ownership to the mortgagee was void for being in the nature of a pactum commissorium.[41]
According to petitioner, respondents cannot automatically appropriate the mortgaged property in the event of nonpayment, since the proper procedure is that of foreclosing the mortgage and, thereafter, buying the same in the auction sale. Instead of foreclosing the contested property, respondents appropriated it for themselves after the death of Primitiva. Being a pactum commissorium, the contract and the subsequent registration of the property in the names of respondents, must be declared void. She submits that TCT No. 286305 under respondents’ names must be declared null and void, and the Register of Deeds of Manila must issue a new title in the name of Primitiva or her estate.[42]

Finally, petitioner asserts that respondents’ claims for rentals have no basis in law and jurisprudence. They are likewise not entitled to attorney’s fees because although they were compelled to litigate, she did not violate any of their rights which could have produced a cause of action. Conversely, they are liable to pay her attorney’s fees for trying to eject her without right to do so, and moral damages because she suffered anxiety, sleepless nights, headaches, and hypertension.[43]

In their Comment,[44] respondents maintain that petitioner has not established any right to remain in the subject property. The Torrens title issued to them which covered the said subject property, is indefeasible and binding upon the whole world unless and until nullified by a court of competent jurisdiction in a direct proceeding for cancellation of title. Moreover, the issue on the validity of title, i.e., whether it was fraudulently issued, can only be raised in an action expressly instituted for that purpose. On the other hand, the question on whether the Bilihan ng Lupa is an equitable mortgage or a contract of sale with equitable redemption, is irrelevant, as the same cannot prevail over the Torrens title, which is conclusive evidence with respect to their ownership of the land described therein.[45]

In her Reply,[46] petitioner argues that the principle of indefeasibility of the Torrens title shall not apply if it is used to perpetrate fraud against a rightful owner. Since respondents acquired the contested property by way of a transaction which is pactum commissorium, the Torrens system cannot be used to countenance a prohibited practice. As such, the Court can invalidate the title issued to respondents since its transmission was made contrary to law and public policy.[47]



The petition is meritorious.
 
Respondents failed to prove by preponderant evidence that they are entitled to be declared owners of the property and to have possession of the same.
 
It is well-settled that the party who alleges the affirmative of the issue has the burden of proof, and that with the plaintiff in a civil case, the burden of proof never parts. Once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case in his or her favor in the course of the trial, however, the duty or the burden of evidence shifts to the defendant to controvert the plaintiff’s prima facie case, otherwise, a verdict must be returned in favor of the plaintiff.[48]

In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his/her case by preponderance of evidence.[49] “Preponderance of evidence means that the evidence adduced by one side is, as a whole, superior to or has greater weight than that of the other or that which is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto. Bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof.”[50]

To support their prayer to be declared lawful owners and to recover possession of the subject property, respondents formally offered in evidence TCT No. 286305 issued under their names, the Declarations of Real Property Value (land and building),[51] the Real Estate Tax receipts, and the Statement of Account for the year 2013.[52] While these pieces of documentary evidence make out a prima facie case in their favor, petitioner successfully controverted respondents’ claim of ownership and discharged the burden of evidence when she proffered the Bilihan ng Lupa and the certification of Atty. Anolin to the effect that the Deed of Sale allegedly executed by Primitiva and petitioner on February 18, 2007 was a forgery.

To stress, the CA ruled correctly that the Bilihan ng Lupa is an equitable mortgage, and not a contract of sale with conventional redemption as held by the RTC. As duly noted by the CA, the Bilihan ng Lupa can be presumed as an equitable mortgage in view of the existence of two circumstances under Art. 1602[53] of the New Civil Code, namely: (1) Primitiva and petitioner were allowed to remain in possession of the property for five years despite the purchase thereof by respondents; and (2) Primitiva was shown to be in dire need of money at the time of the transaction in order to redeem the same property from Piamonte.

At any rate, whenever it is clearly shown that a deed of sale with pacto de retro, regular on its face is given as a security for a loan, it must be regarded as an equitable mortgage inasmuch as a sale with right to repurchase is not favored.[54] In case of doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase shall be construed as an equitable mortgage,[55] because this involves a smaller transmission of rights and interests.[56]

Significantly, respondents did not present any evidence to prove their allegation that they purchased the property from Primitiva on February 16, 2007, or that they had foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the property in a public auction. They even failed to dispute the authenticity and due execution of the Bilihan ng Lupa which the CA found to be an equitable mortgage and not a contract of sale with conventional redemption. Notably, in the Reply they filed before the RTC, they even averred that they bought the property from Primitiva and noted that petitioner herself was witness to the transaction by signing the Bilihan ng Lupa. Having failed to specifically deny under oath the existence of the Bilihan ng Lupa which is the basis of petitioner’s affirmative defense, they are deemed to have admitted its authenticity and due execution.

Apart from the Bilihan ng Lupa dated February 18, 2007 which indicated a consideration of P135,000.00 plus the right to repurchase within five years from its effectivity, there are two other contracts submitted by petitioner as evidence purportedly executed by Primitiva which conveyed ownership over the same subject property to respondents for various considerations: (1) Kasunduan dated February 16, 2007 for P450,000.00; and (2) Deed of Sale[57] dated February 18, 2007 for P70,000.00 which was denounced as a forgery by the same notary public who notarized the Bilihan ng Lupa. Respondents neither denied their existence nor explained, at the very least, how they were able to validly acquire the property from Primitiva and transfer its registration under their names.

Instead, respondents stake their claim of absolute and indefeasible title by presenting TCT No. 286305, tax declarations, and receipts of realty tax payments. They posit that due to the indefeasibility of a Torrens title, the same should prevail and render immaterial the claim that the Bilihan ng Lupa is an equitable mortgage.[58]

Respondents’ claim fails to persuade.

Tax declarations and tax receipts may only become the basis of a claim for ownership when they are coupled with proof of actual possession of the property.[59] Unfortunately, respondents cannot rely on this rule in light of their admission that they were not in possession of the property after having bought the same from Primitiva. Moreover, the Bilihan ng Lupa expressly allowed Primitiva and petitioner to continue living in the property for five years starting on February 18, 2007.

On the other hand, while a certificate of title serves as evidence of an indefeasible and incontrovertible title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears therein, it is not a conclusive proof of ownership, but merely confirms or records title already existing and vested.[60] In Spouses Yu Hwa Ping and Gaw v. Ayala Land, Inc.,[61] the Court explained the principle as follows:

It is a well-settled rule that ownership is different from a certificate of title. The fact that a person was able to secure a title in his name does not operate to vest ownership upon him of the subject land. Registration of a piece of land under the Torrens System does not create or vest title, because it is not a mode of acquiring ownership. A certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership or title over the particular property described therein. It cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner; nor can it be used as a shield for the commission of fraud; neither does it permit one to enrich himself at the expense of others. Its issuance in favor of a particular person does not foreclose the possibility that the real property may be co-owned with persons not named in the certificate, or that it may be held in trust for another person by the registered owner.[62]

Considering that respondents’ pieces of evidence, consisting of a certificate of title, tax declarations, and tax receipts, are insufficient to prove how they acquired the subject property from Primitiva, their claim of ownership and prayer for its recovery must be rejected. Conversely, since the Bilihan ng Lupa proffered by petitioner is the only evidence that was formally offered and admitted by the RTC to establish how they acquired the subject property, respondents should have further proven that they transferred ownership thereof under their names by foreclosing on the equitable mortgage and thereafter, purchasing the property in a public auction. Inasmuch as mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof,[63] their bare and unsubstantiated allegation that they secured a transfer certificate of title over the property by going through the proper channels and government authorities deserves no credence.
 

In a reivindicatory suit, the issue of direct or collateral attack on plaintiff’s title is irrelevant, as the court can rule definitively on the issue of ownership and pass upon the validity of the certificate of title.
 
To be sure, respondents cannot claim that the defense raised by petitioner is a collateral attack on their title.

In Heirs of Cullado v. Gutierrez[64] (Cullado), the Court ruled that if the plaintiff’s claim of ownership is based on a Torrens title and the defendant disputes the validity of such title, then the issue of whether there is a direct or collateral attack on the plaintiff’s title is irrelevant. This is because the court where the reivindicatory or reconveyance suit is filed has the requisite jurisdiction to rule definitively or with finality on the issue of ownership—it can pass upon the validity of the plaintiff’s certificate of title.[65]

Here, respondents’ Complaint is for recovery of possession and declaration of ownership of the property on the basis of TCT No. 286305 registered in their names. In her Answer, petitioner sought for the dismissal of the Complaint anchored on the affirmative defense that based on the Bilihan ng Lupa, Primitiva “never had the intention of relinquishing her property,”[66] and that respondents’ “action of transferring the registration to their name[s] should be declared null and void considering that the issuance of title in the name[s] of [respondents] was done fraudulently.”[67] In consonance with the ruling in Cullado, respondents cannot raise that petitioner’s counterclaim is a collateral attack on their title, as the trial court has jurisdiction to rule definitively on the issue of ownership and validity of the certificate of title of the property.
 

Registration of the property under respondents’ names facilitated in a prohibited pactum commissorium manner was void; Respondents’ title should be cancelled and Primitiva’s title, as owner-mortgagor should be reinstated.
 
On the issue of the validity of respondents’ acquisition of ownership of the subject property, Art. 2088[68] of the New Civil Code provides that a creditor cannot appropriate or consolidate ownership over a mortgaged property merely upon failure of the mortgagor to pay a debt obligation. The essence of pactum commissorium is that ownership of the security will pass to the creditor by the mere default of the debtor.[69] Incidentally, the only right of a mortgagee in case of nonpayment of debt secured by mortgage would be to foreclose the mortgage and have the encumbered property sold to satisfy the outstanding indebtedness.[70] The mortgagor’s default does not operate to automatically vest on the mortgagee the ownership of the encumbered property, for any such effect is against public policy.[71]

In view of the undisputed existence of the Bilihan ng Lupa, and in the absence of proof that the said mortgage was foreclosed and the property was acquired in a public auction, the Court rules that the registration of the property under respondents’ names was void. Such transfer constituted a pactum commissorium which is prohibited by existing laws for being contrary to morals and public policy. Consequently, the CA erred in upholding the RTC ruling that respondents had established themselves as the duly registered owner of the subject property who have the consequent right to possession. Perforce, respondents’ Complaint should be dismissed for lack of merit.

Meanwhile, the CA also erred in ruling that (I) it is ineffective to insist on the mortgage since no one has the right to redeem the subject property; and (2) Primitiva had no known heirs to whom the rights and obligations would have passed on after her death.[72]

Nowhere in the records can it be gathered that petitioner is insisting on redeeming the subject property as an heir or assign of Primitiva. Instead, she asserts in her Answer that Primitiva never had the intention to relinquish the property, and that respondents’ action of transferring the registration to their names should be declared null and void, because the issuance of the title in their names was done fraudulently. She did not pray to be declared owner of the subject property, but rather seeks for the dismissal of respondents’ Complaint. Through a Judicial Affidavit,[73] she testified that the property subject of the Bilihan ng Lupa was meant to secure the payment of an obligation, and not to be sold to respondents, thus:

17. QUESTION: Nasabi mo kanina na isa rin sa dahilan kung bakit ka narito ay upang ipakita ang iyong tunay na kasunduan, at ito ay ang “Bilihan ng Lupa”, maaari mo bang sabihin sa hukumang ito ang dahilan bakit nabuo ang kasunduang ito?
ANSWER: Ako po ay nangailangan ng pera sapagkat ang titulo na nasa pangalan ng aking ina[-]inahan ay unang nakasanla kay Lordita Piamonte. Sa kagustuhan naming ito [ay] matubos, lumapit ako kay Cecilia Carpio at nakiusap ako na kung maaari ay sila muna ang tumubos sa lupa sa halagang ONE HUNDRED THIRTY[-]FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P135,000.00).

18. QUESTION: Ano naman ang reaksyon ni Cecilia Carpio?
ANSWER: Sumang[-]ayon po siya na kaniyang tutubusin ang titulo kay Lordita Piamonte at pagkatapos po ay gumawa siya ng Kasunduan na ang title ay “Bilihan ng Lupa”.

19. QUESTION: Ang sinasabi mo bang “Bilihan ng Lupa” ay ang kasunduang iniabot mo sa akin kanina lamang?
ANSWER: Opo.

20. QUESTION: Sino ang mga taong bumubuo sa kasunduang ito?
ANSWER: Si Primitiva Caamic po, ang mag-asawang Carpio at ako bilang testigo.
 
21. QUESTION: Bilang testigo sa Kasunduan na “Bilihan ng Lupa,” ano ang importanteng bahagi ng kasunduang ito, kung mayroon man?
ANSWER: Iyon pong sinasabi na pwede naming tubusin ang lupa sa loob ng limang taon simula sa pagkasanla noong February 18, 2007 hanggang February 18, 2012.[74]

However, petitioner’s contention that the CA erred in sustaining the transfer of title of the subject property despite the explicit prohibition on stipulation of pactum commissorium, is misplaced.

To be sure, there is no stipulation in the Bilihan ng Lupa which amounts to pactum commissorium whereby ownership of the property will pass to the creditor by the mere default of the debtor. For ready reference, the contract reads:

BILIHAN NG LUPA

Sa kaalaman ng lahat, kami sina PRIMITIV A CAYANAN CAAMIC at ANNALIZA CAAMIC SINGSON, mag-ina, pawang mga nasa hustong gulang at nakatira sa 22 E. Delos Santos St., Block 5, Magsaysay Village, Tondo, Manila, ay nagpapatunay sa mga sumusunod:
Na ako si PRIMITIVA CAYANAN CAAMIC ay nagmamay­ari ng isang piraso ng lote tulad ng pinatutunayan ng SN No. 1877679 at Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 267017 ng Register of Deeds ng Maynila;
Na si ANNALIZA CAAMIC SINGSON ay tinuturing kong anak at ako ay kasalukuyang naninirahan sa nasabing lote;
Na dahil sa pangangailangan namin ng salapi, ipinagbili ko kay CECILIA CAO CARPIO, nasa hustong gulang, may-asawa at naninirahan sa 103 D. Del Pilar St., Block 5, Magsaysay Village, Tondo, Manila ang nasabing lote sa halagang Isang Daan at Tatlumpu’t-Limang Libong Piso (Php 135,000.00) kuwarta ng Pilipinas, sa kasunduang kami ay patuloy na maninirahan sa loob ng limang (5) taon simula ngayong ika-18 ng Pebrero taong 2007. Gayon din ang karapatang bilhin muli ang nasabing pag­aari mula kay CECILIA CAO CARPIO sa halagang Isang Daan at Tatlumpu’t-Limang Libong Piso (Php 135,000.00) kuwarta ng Pilipinas na may interest na 3% kada buwan. Nagkakahalaga ito ng Tatlung Daan at Walumpu’t-Pitong Libong Piso (Php 387,000.00) kuwarta ng Pilipinas sa loob ng Limang (5) taon;
Pagkatapos ng Limang (5) taong kontrata simula ngayong ika-18 ng Pebrero 2007, kami ay obligadong aalis sa nasabing lote at ang kasulatan na pwede naming bilhin muli ay mababalewala. Matatapos ang kasulatang ito sa petsang ika-18 ng Pebrero taong 2012.[75] (Emphasis omitted)
Pertinent portions of the contract indicate the following tenns and conditions: (1) that Primitiva is the owner of the subject property covered by TCT No. 267107; (2) that Primitiva and petitioner, were currently occupying the subject property; (3) that since they need money, Primitiva is selling the subject property to respondent Cecilia Cao Carpio for P135,000.00; (4) that Primitiva and petitioner will continue to live in the subject property for five years starting on February 18, 2007; (5) that Primitiva reserves the right to repurchase the subject property within five years for P135,000.00 plus interest of 3% per month, or for a total amount of P387,000.00; (6) that after five years from the start of the contract on February 18, 2007, or until February 18, 2012, they are obliged to leave the subject property and that the provision on the repurchase thereof will become ineffective. Clearly, there is nothing in the terms and conditions of the Bilihan ng Lupa that provides for the automatic appropriation of the subject property by respondents upon failure to redeem the same.

Nonetheless, when a document appears on its face to be a sale with pacto de retro, the owner of the property may prove that the contract is really a loan with mortgage, by raising as an issue the fact that the document does not express the true intent and agreement of the contracting parties.[76] Upon proof of the truth of the allegations that the instrument was merely given as a security for the repayment of a loan, the courts will enforce the agreement or understanding, in accord with the true intent of the parties at the time the contract was executed, even if the conveyance was accompanied by registration in the name of the transferee and the issuance of a new certificate of title in the latter’s name.[77]

Applying the principle of pactum commissorium to equitable mortgages, the Court ruled in Montevirgen v. Court of Appeals[78] that the consolidation of ownership in the person of the mortgagee in equity, merely upon failure of the mortgagor in equity to pay the obligation, would amount to a pactum commissorium. If a mortgagee in equity desires to obtain title to a mortgaged property, the mortgagee’s proper remedy is to cause the foreclosure of the mortgage in equity and buy it in a foreclosure sale.[79]
 
In Cruz v. Court of Appeals,[80] the Court again reiterated that, in an equitable mortgage, perfect title over the mortgaged property may not be secured in a pactum commissorium fashion, but only by causing the foreclosure of the mortgage and buying the same in an auction sale.[81]

In Spouses Solitarios v. Spouses Jaque,[82] a case involving a complaint for ownership and recovery of possession where the subject property was transferred to the mortgagee in a prohibited pactum commissorium manner, the Court voided the transaction and the registration of the deeds of sale by virtue of which the mortgagee was able to obtain the impugned TCT.[83]

In Dacquel v. Spouses Sotelo,[84] the Court noted that the transaction between the parties was demonstrated to be one of equitable mortgage. It then ruled that therein petitioner did not become the owner of the subject property involved but a mere mortgagee thereof. Thus, therein petitioner was bound by the prohibition against pactum commissorium. Having found that said petitioner proceeded to cause the cancellation of therein respondents’ title to the mortgaged property and its transfer to therein petitioner’s name without availing of the remedy of foreclosure, the Court concluded that said petitioner dabbled in the prohibited practice of pactum commissorium and that the transaction is consequently rendered void, and title to therein subject property should be reverted to therein respondents.

To reiterate, respondents failed to present preponderant evidence to prove that they foreclosed the equitable mortgage denominated as Bilihan ng Lupa and acquired the subject property in a public auction. For failure to present any evidence on how they acquired the subject property from Primitiva, the Court can reasonably conclude that respondents’ acquisition thereof by virtue of the Bilihan ng Lupa amounts to pactum commissorium.

Since respondents’ acquisition of the subject property by virtue of the Bilihan ng Lupa amounts to the prohibited practice of pactum commissorium, the CA erred in affirming the RTC when it sustained the transfer of title thereto under their names. Thus, the title issued under respondents’ names should be nullified and reinstated in the name of Primitiva. After all, in an equitable mortgage, title to the property in issue which has been transferred to the mortgagee actually remains or is transferred back to the owner-mortgagor, conformably to the settled doctrine that the mortgagee does not become the owner of the mortgaged property because ownership thereof remains with the mortgagor pursuant to Art. 2088 of the New Civil Code.[85]
 

Respondents failed to prove their right over the property, possession of the same cannot be awarded in their favor
 
The Court is aware of its ruling in Muñoz v. Ramirez,[86] where it was established that the reciprocal obligations of the parties were under an equitable mortgage. In the said case, the Court ordered the reconveyance of the property to the mortgagor upon the payment of the loan within 90 days from finality of the decision.[87] A similar ruling cannot be rendered in the instant case in view of Primitiva’s death, and the fact that respondents had not been in possession of the subject property. It also bears noting that the records do not reveal any information on Primitiva’s estate.

At any rate, in an accion reivindicatoria, like the complaint filed by respondents, the plaintiff alleges ownership over a parcel of land and seeks recovery of its full possession.[88] It is an action to recover possession of a parcel of land as an element of ownership. In such an action, the basic question is whether the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to prove his/her ownership of the property in question. Like in all civil cases, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish his/her case by preponderance of evidence, which, in the final analysis, means probability of the truth. It is evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto. The plaintiff must rely on the strength of his/her own evidence and not upon the weakness of that of his/her opponent.[89]

Here, respondents failed to present evidence that they had acquired ownership of the subject property through foreclosure of the equitable mortgage and purchase at a public auction. As such, they cannot validly demand upon petitioner to vacate and surrender possession of the subject property and to pay rentals thereon, given that the right to use or enjoy the property and its fruits is one of the attributes of ownership.
 

No basis to award moral damages and attorney’s fees
 
Anent the award of moral damages and attorney’s fees, such civil liability cannot be granted in petitioner’s favor.

Moral damages are recoverable only if the party from whom it is claimed has acted fraudulently or in bad faith or in wanton disregard of his/her contractual obligations.[90] Bad faith, on the other hand, does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence, but imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud.[91]

As to fraud, on the other hand, the rule is that he/she who alleges the same affecting a transaction must substantiate such allegation, since it is presumed that a person takes ordinary care of concerns and that private transactions have been fair and regular.[92] Fraud is never presumed but must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, mere preponderance of evidence not even being adequate.[93] Contentions must be proved by competent evidence and reliance must be had on the strength of the party’s evidence and not upon the weakness of the opponent’s defense.[94] Mere allegation is definitely not evidence.[95]

The Court is not convinced that respondents acted fraudulently or in bad faith in transferring the title of the subject property under their names. Petitioner failed to formally offer in evidence the contracts purportedly conveying the subject property to respondents, namely: (1) the Kasunduan dated February 16, 2007; and (2) the Deed of Sale dated February 18, 2007 which was certified as a forgery by the same notary public who notarized the Bilihan ng Lupa. Petitioner only presented the Bilihan ng Lupa which the Court confirmed to be an equitable mortgage that must first be foreclosed before respondents can acquire ownership thereof in a public auction. What was only established in this case is that the subject property was transferred under respondents’ names in a prohibited pactum commissorium manner, but not through fraudulent means or in bad faith.

Besides, the award of moral damages must be anchored on a clear showing that mental anguish, besmirched reputation, sleepless nights, wounded feelings, or similar injury was actually experienced.[96] There is no better witness to this experience than petitioner herself, but she failed to testify thereon, even in her judicial affidavit. Hence, there is no basis for the award of moral damages.

As for the award of attorney’s fees, Art. 2208 of the New Civil Code provides that in the absence of stipulation, attorney’s fees cannot be recovered, except:

(1)
When exemplary damages are awarded;
(2)
When the defendant’s act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest;
(3)
In criminal cases of malicious prosecution against the plaintiff;
(4)
In case of a clearly unfounded civil action or proceeding against the plaintiff;
(5)
Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff’s plainly valid, just and demandable claim;
(6)
In actions for legal support;
(7)
In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;
(8)
In actions for indemnity under workmen’s compensation and employer’s liability laws;
(9)
In a separate civil action to recover civil liability arising from a crime;
(10)
When at least double judicial costs are awarded;
(11)
In any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.
In all cases, the attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation must be reasonable.

The general rule is that attorney’s fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.[97] Being the exception rather than the rule, an award of such fees requires compelling reason before it may be granted. Even when a claimant is compelled to bring his/her cause to court or incur expenses to protect his/her rights, attorney’s fees still may not be awarded as part of damages where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party’s persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of its cause.[98]

In this case, petitioner neither proven bad faith on the part of respondents nor the existence of an agreement between them as to warrant the award of attorney’s fees. In fine, there is no basis to grant attorney’s fees pursuant to Art. 2208 of the New Civil Code.
 
WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The October 26, 2017 Decision and the April 12, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104327 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

The Complaint for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of Real Property with Damages docketed as Civil Case No. 10-124055 is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

Transfer Certificate Title No. 286305 in the name of respondents Nar Christian D. Carpio and Cecilia Cao Carpio, is declared VOID and CANCELLED. The Register of Deeds of Manila City is further ORDERED to REINSTATE Transfer Certificate of Title No. 267017 in the name of Primitiva Cayanan Caamic, subject to the equitable mortgage right of respondents to foreclose the same subject property.

SO ORDERED.

Hernando, Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","Respondents claim ownership over a 51.24-square meter land, including the two-storey residential house erected thereon situated at No. 22-E Block 5, De los Santos Street, Magsaysay Village, Tondo, Manila (subject property), and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 286305.[6] They acquired the said property from Primitiva Cayanan Vda. De Caamic (Primitiva) on February 16, 2007, and averred that since then, they had been religiously paying the realty taxes, as shown by official receipts for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.[7]
It appears that prior to and after the sale, petitioner and Primitiva had been occupying the subject property. However, after Primitiva died on July 21, 2007,[8] Enriquito, claiming to be her son and heir, suddenly surfaced and asserted his interest over the subject property. When petitioner and Enriquito refused to vacate the subject property despite repeated demands, respondents filed a complaint before their barangay for possible conciliation. Unfortunately, no amicable settlement was reached based on the certification to file action issued by the Lupong Tagapamayapa.[9]

Thus, on August 6, 2010, respondents filed a Complaint for Recovery of Possession and Ownership of Real Property with Damages and prayed that they be declared as lawful owners of the subject property and that Enriquito and petitioner be ordered to vacate the same. Respondents also urged the RTC to order Enriquito and petitioner to pay the following amounts: (1) monthly rental in the amount of P1,500.00 from July 2007 up to the time they actually vacate the premises; (2) P50,000.00 as moral damages; (3) P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; (4) P30,000.00 as attorney’s fees, plus P3,000.00 appearance fee per hearing; and (5) costs of suit.[10]

In her Answer,[11] petitioner claimed to be the grandniece of Primitiva and her husband, who took care of Primitiva during her lifetime. She also helped Primitiva secure a loan from respondents who were their neighbors, in the amount of P135,000.00 which Primitiva used to redeem the subject property from a certain Lordita Piamonte (Piamonte). While respondents agreed to loan the said amount, they made Primitiva and petitioner sign a notarized document entitled “Bilihan ng Lupa“[12] for assurance.[13]

Several months after Primitiva died, petitioner received through mail a document entitled “Kasunduan“[14] dated February 16, 2007 which indicated that Primitiva had sold the property to respondents for the amount of P450,000.00. Since it was the first time that petitioner saw the document, she informed her uncle, Enriquito, about it.[15]

When Enriquito arrived from the province, petitioner accompanied him to Atty. Richard Anolin (Atty. Anolin) who supposedly notarized the document. However, Atty. Anolin issued a Certification[16] indicating that he did not notarize a document entitled “Deed of Sale”[17] dated February 18, 2007 which appeared to have been executed by Primitiva and petitioner. This prompted petitioner and Enriquito to file a case for falsification against respondents before the City Prosecutor of Manila. While the case was in its preliminary investigation, respondents attempted to register the subject property under their names, but petitioner opposed the move. However, for unknown reasons, respondents had been successful in registering the subject property under their names on their third attempt.[18]

As part of her affirmative defense, petitioner asserted that Primitiva had no intention of relinquishing the subject property. She insisted that with the existence of the document Bilihan ng Lupa, respondents have no cause of action and that the transfer of the registration of the contested subject property to their names was done fraudulently.[19]

In their Reply,[20] respondents alleged that petitioner herself was a witness to the signing of the Bilihan ng Lupa. They were able to transfer the title to their names by going through the proper channels and government authorities, hence, there is no basis for petitioner’s claim of fraud. On the other hand, petitioner had not shown her entitlement to the property either as an heir, donee, vendee, or owner by prescription. Moreover, petitioner, in effect, was collaterally attacking the validity of their title, which she cannot do since Torrens titles are indefeasible and binding upon the whole world unless nullified by a court of competent jurisdiction.[21]

During trial, respondents presented only one witness, Nar, and submitted the following documentary evidence, namely: a certified true copy of TCT No. 286305 of the Register of Deeds of Manila; the declarations of real property value (land and building) in respondents’ names; the real estate tax receipt and real estate tax statement of account for the year 2013; the notice to vacate addressed to Enriquito and petitioner; the certification by the post office that the registered mail was duly received; and the certificate to file action issued by the Lupong Tagapamayapa.[22]

On the other hand, petitioner testified to support her claims and presented the following documents: a copy of the Bilihan ng Lupa; the death certificate of Primitiva; the certification of Atty. Anolin to the effect that the Deed of Sale allegedly executed by Primitiva and petitioner was a forgery; and her judicial affidavit.[23]

Meanwhile, on July 22, 2011, respondents filed a Manifestation and Motion to Drop Enriquito C. Caamic as Defendant,[24] averring that he had already vacated the subject property. On November 8, 2011, the RTC granted the motion and dropped Enriquito as party-defendant.[25]","Petitioner raises the sole issue of whether the CA gravely erred in affirming the RTC despite proof that the Bilihan ng Lupa is in the nature of a pactum commissorium.[39] Petitioner contends that the CA accorded respondents with the power to automatically appropriate the mortgaged property in the event of nonpayment. She insists that the ruling in Spouses Solitarios v. Spouses Jaque[40] squarely applies in the case at bench where the Court, despite finding that the deed of sale was an equitable mortgage, ruled that the transfer of ownership to the mortgagee was void for being in the nature of a pactum commissorium.[41]
According to petitioner, respondents cannot automatically appropriate the mortgaged property in the event of nonpayment, since the proper procedure is that of foreclosing the mortgage and, thereafter, buying the same in the auction sale. Instead of foreclosing the contested property, respondents appropriated it for themselves after the death of Primitiva. Being a pactum commissorium, the contract and the subsequent registration of the property in the names of respondents, must be declared void. She submits that TCT No. 286305 under respondents’ names must be declared null and void, and the Register of Deeds of Manila must issue a new title in the name of Primitiva or her estate.[42]

Finally, petitioner asserts that respondents’ claims for rentals have no basis in law and jurisprudence. They are likewise not entitled to attorney’s fees because although they were compelled to litigate, she did not violate any of their rights which could have produced a cause of action. Conversely, they are liable to pay her attorney’s fees for trying to eject her without right to do so, and moral damages because she suffered anxiety, sleepless nights, headaches, and hypertension.[43]

In their Comment,[44] respondents maintain that petitioner has not established any right to remain in the subject property. The Torrens title issued to them which covered the said subject property, is indefeasible and binding upon the whole world unless and until nullified by a court of competent jurisdiction in a direct proceeding for cancellation of title. Moreover, the issue on the validity of title, i.e., whether it was fraudulently issued, can only be raised in an action expressly instituted for that purpose. On the other hand, the question on whether the Bilihan ng Lupa is an equitable mortgage or a contract of sale with equitable redemption, is irrelevant, as the same cannot prevail over the Torrens title, which is conclusive evidence with respect to their ownership of the land described therein.[45]

In her Reply,[46] petitioner argues that the principle of indefeasibility of the Torrens title shall not apply if it is used to perpetrate fraud against a rightful owner. Since respondents acquired the contested property by way of a transaction which is pactum commissorium, the Torrens system cannot be used to countenance a prohibited practice. As such, the Court can invalidate the title issued to respondents since its transmission was made contrary to law and public policy.[47]","In its November 4, 2014 Decision, the RTC decreed:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendant:

1. To vacate and voluntarily surrender possession of the subject house and lot located at No. 22-E Block 5, [D]e los Santos Street, Magsaysay Village, Tonda, Manila and covered by TCT No. 286305 upon [respondents];

2. To pay [respondents] the monthly rental of [P]1,500.00 due [to] her occupation of the premises and starting July 2007 until she has actually vacated the premises; and

3. To pay [respondents’] Attorney’s [f]ees m the amount of [P]30,000.00.

SO ORDERED.[26]

The RTC ruled that based on the evidence presented by both parties, particularly the document Bilihan ng Lupa, the transaction between them was a contract of sale with conventional redemption. It noted that the bone of contention between them is the provisions of such document on the vendor’s right to redeem or buyback the property within five years from the date of the instrument.[27]

Taking into account the terms and conditions of the document Bilihan ng Lupa and Articles 1601[28] and 1616[29] of the Civil Code, the RTC held that there was a valid transfer of ownership from the previous owner/vendor, Primitiva, to respondents. As such, respondents were not prohibited from registering the title in their names, but without prejudice to the right of Primitiva to redeem it within the agreed period. The RTC held that when Primitiva died in July of 2007, her right to redeem had also ended. Thus, when petitioner and Enriquito tried to redeem the subject property, they were already barred from doing so.[30]

Aggrieved, petitioner filed an Appeal,[31] assigning the lone error that the RTC gravely erred in holding that the Bilihan ng Lupa was a perfected contract of sale with conventional redemption.[32] She insisted that since the contract between Primitiva and respondents was an equitable mortgage, respondents’ remedy was either to recover the loaned amount by filing an action for sum of money or foreclosing the property.[33]

On October 26, 2017, the CA rendered a Decision affirming the RTC. It ruled that the Bilihan ng Lupa, is an equitable mortgage because: (1) Primitiva and petitioner remained in possession of the subject property despite the purchase; and (2) Primitiva was in dire need of money to redeem the subject property at the time of the transaction.[34]
The CA, however, held that regardless of the finding that the transaction was an equitable mortgage, petitioner cannot insist on the same because nobody had the right to redeem the contested realty. When Primitiva died, she had no known heirs to whom her rights and obligations could have been passed on. Even if petitioner may have been treated by Primitiva as her own daughter, she was only a distant relative and not a legal heir. Thus, the right of redemption did not pass unto her. Having failed to establish her legal personality to redeem the property, she is likewise found to have no personality to insist on the equitable mortgage.[35]

Furthermore, Enriquito, as the supposed heir of Primitiva, failed to present any convincing evidence to corroborate his claim other than his belated registration of birth certificate. He likewise failed to prove his right as an heir when he voluntarily did not participate during the proceedings of the case.[36]

The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed 4 November 2014 Decision of the RTC is AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[37]

Dissatisfied with the CA Decision, petitioner filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration.[38] In its Resolution dated April 12, 2018, the CA denied the motion. Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari.

The petition is meritorious.
 
Respondents failed to prove by preponderant evidence that they are entitled to be declared owners of the property and to have possession of the same.
 
It is well-settled that the party who alleges the affirmative of the issue has the burden of proof, and that with the plaintiff in a civil case, the burden of proof never parts. Once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case in his or her favor in the course of the trial, however, the duty or the burden of evidence shifts to the defendant to controvert the plaintiff’s prima facie case, otherwise, a verdict must be returned in favor of the plaintiff.[48]

In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his/her case by preponderance of evidence.[49] “Preponderance of evidence means that the evidence adduced by one side is, as a whole, superior to or has greater weight than that of the other or that which is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto. Bare allegations, unsubstantiated by evidence, are not equivalent to proof.”[50]

To support their prayer to be declared lawful owners and to recover possession of the subject property, respondents formally offered in evidence TCT No. 286305 issued under their names, the Declarations of Real Property Value (land and building),[51] the Real Estate Tax receipts, and the Statement of Account for the year 2013.[52] While these pieces of documentary evidence make out a prima facie case in their favor, petitioner successfully controverted respondents’ claim of ownership and discharged the burden of evidence when she proffered the Bilihan ng Lupa and the certification of Atty. Anolin to the effect that the Deed of Sale allegedly executed by Primitiva and petitioner on February 18, 2007 was a forgery.

To stress, the CA ruled correctly that the Bilihan ng Lupa is an equitable mortgage, and not a contract of sale with conventional redemption as held by the RTC. As duly noted by the CA, the Bilihan ng Lupa can be presumed as an equitable mortgage in view of the existence of two circumstances under Art. 1602[53] of the New Civil Code, namely: (1) Primitiva and petitioner were allowed to remain in possession of the property for five years despite the purchase thereof by respondents; and (2) Primitiva was shown to be in dire need of money at the time of the transaction in order to redeem the same property from Piamonte.

At any rate, whenever it is clearly shown that a deed of sale with pacto de retro, regular on its face is given as a security for a loan, it must be regarded as an equitable mortgage inasmuch as a sale with right to repurchase is not favored.[54] In case of doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase shall be construed as an equitable mortgage,[55] because this involves a smaller transmission of rights and interests.[56]

Significantly, respondents did not present any evidence to prove their allegation that they purchased the property from Primitiva on February 16, 2007, or that they had foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the property in a public auction. They even failed to dispute the authenticity and due execution of the Bilihan ng Lupa which the CA found to be an equitable mortgage and not a contract of sale with conventional redemption. Notably, in the Reply they filed before the RTC, they even averred that they bought the property from Primitiva and noted that petitioner herself was witness to the transaction by signing the Bilihan ng Lupa. Having failed to specifically deny under oath the existence of the Bilihan ng Lupa which is the basis of petitioner’s affirmative defense, they are deemed to have admitted its authenticity and due execution.

Apart from the Bilihan ng Lupa dated February 18, 2007 which indicated a consideration of P135,000.00 plus the right to repurchase within five years from its effectivity, there are two other contracts submitted by petitioner as evidence purportedly executed by Primitiva which conveyed ownership over the same subject property to respondents for various considerations: (1) Kasunduan dated February 16, 2007 for P450,000.00; and (2) Deed of Sale[57] dated February 18, 2007 for P70,000.00 which was denounced as a forgery by the same notary public who notarized the Bilihan ng Lupa. Respondents neither denied their existence nor explained, at the very least, how they were able to validly acquire the property from Primitiva and transfer its registration under their names.

Instead, respondents stake their claim of absolute and indefeasible title by presenting TCT No. 286305, tax declarations, and receipts of realty tax payments. They posit that due to the indefeasibility of a Torrens title, the same should prevail and render immaterial the claim that the Bilihan ng Lupa is an equitable mortgage.[58]

Respondents’ claim fails to persuade.

Tax declarations and tax receipts may only become the basis of a claim for ownership when they are coupled with proof of actual possession of the property.[59] Unfortunately, respondents cannot rely on this rule in light of their admission that they were not in possession of the property after having bought the same from Primitiva. Moreover, the Bilihan ng Lupa expressly allowed Primitiva and petitioner to continue living in the property for five years starting on February 18, 2007.

On the other hand, while a certificate of title serves as evidence of an indefeasible and incontrovertible title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears therein, it is not a conclusive proof of ownership, but merely confirms or records title already existing and vested.[60] In Spouses Yu Hwa Ping and Gaw v. Ayala Land, Inc.,[61] the Court explained the principle as follows:

It is a well-settled rule that ownership is different from a certificate of title. The fact that a person was able to secure a title in his name does not operate to vest ownership upon him of the subject land. Registration of a piece of land under the Torrens System does not create or vest title, because it is not a mode of acquiring ownership. A certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership or title over the particular property described therein. It cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner; nor can it be used as a shield for the commission of fraud; neither does it permit one to enrich himself at the expense of others. Its issuance in favor of a particular person does not foreclose the possibility that the real property may be co-owned with persons not named in the certificate, or that it may be held in trust for another person by the registered owner.[62]

Considering that respondents’ pieces of evidence, consisting of a certificate of title, tax declarations, and tax receipts, are insufficient to prove how they acquired the subject property from Primitiva, their claim of ownership and prayer for its recovery must be rejected. Conversely, since the Bilihan ng Lupa proffered by petitioner is the only evidence that was formally offered and admitted by the RTC to establish how they acquired the subject property, respondents should have further proven that they transferred ownership thereof under their names by foreclosing on the equitable mortgage and thereafter, purchasing the property in a public auction. Inasmuch as mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof,[63] their bare and unsubstantiated allegation that they secured a transfer certificate of title over the property by going through the proper channels and government authorities deserves no credence.
 

In a reivindicatory suit, the issue of direct or collateral attack on plaintiff’s title is irrelevant, as the court can rule definitively on the issue of ownership and pass upon the validity of the certificate of title.
 
To be sure, respondents cannot claim that the defense raised by petitioner is a collateral attack on their title.

In Heirs of Cullado v. Gutierrez[64] (Cullado), the Court ruled that if the plaintiff’s claim of ownership is based on a Torrens title and the defendant disputes the validity of such title, then the issue of whether there is a direct or collateral attack on the plaintiff’s title is irrelevant. This is because the court where the reivindicatory or reconveyance suit is filed has the requisite jurisdiction to rule definitively or with finality on the issue of ownership—it can pass upon the validity of the plaintiff’s certificate of title.[65]

Here, respondents’ Complaint is for recovery of possession and declaration of ownership of the property on the basis of TCT No. 286305 registered in their names. In her Answer, petitioner sought for the dismissal of the Complaint anchored on the affirmative defense that based on the Bilihan ng Lupa, Primitiva “never had the intention of relinquishing her property,”[66] and that respondents’ “action of transferring the registration to their name[s] should be declared null and void considering that the issuance of title in the name[s] of [respondents] was done fraudulently.”[67] In consonance with the ruling in Cullado, respondents cannot raise that petitioner’s counterclaim is a collateral attack on their title, as the trial court has jurisdiction to rule definitively on the issue of ownership and validity of the certificate of title of the property.
 

Registration of the property under respondents’ names facilitated in a prohibited pactum commissorium manner was void; Respondents’ title should be cancelled and Primitiva’s title, as owner-mortgagor should be reinstated.
 
On the issue of the validity of respondents’ acquisition of ownership of the subject property, Art. 2088[68] of the New Civil Code provides that a creditor cannot appropriate or consolidate ownership over a mortgaged property merely upon failure of the mortgagor to pay a debt obligation. The essence of pactum commissorium is that ownership of the security will pass to the creditor by the mere default of the debtor.[69] Incidentally, the only right of a mortgagee in case of nonpayment of debt secured by mortgage would be to foreclose the mortgage and have the encumbered property sold to satisfy the outstanding indebtedness.[70] The mortgagor’s default does not operate to automatically vest on the mortgagee the ownership of the encumbered property, for any such effect is against public policy.[71]

In view of the undisputed existence of the Bilihan ng Lupa, and in the absence of proof that the said mortgage was foreclosed and the property was acquired in a public auction, the Court rules that the registration of the property under respondents’ names was void. Such transfer constituted a pactum commissorium which is prohibited by existing laws for being contrary to morals and public policy. Consequently, the CA erred in upholding the RTC ruling that respondents had established themselves as the duly registered owner of the subject property who have the consequent right to possession. Perforce, respondents’ Complaint should be dismissed for lack of merit.

Meanwhile, the CA also erred in ruling that (I) it is ineffective to insist on the mortgage since no one has the right to redeem the subject property; and (2) Primitiva had no known heirs to whom the rights and obligations would have passed on after her death.[72]

Nowhere in the records can it be gathered that petitioner is insisting on redeeming the subject property as an heir or assign of Primitiva. Instead, she asserts in her Answer that Primitiva never had the intention to relinquish the property, and that respondents’ action of transferring the registration to their names should be declared null and void, because the issuance of the title in their names was done fraudulently. She did not pray to be declared owner of the subject property, but rather seeks for the dismissal of respondents’ Complaint. Through a Judicial Affidavit,[73] she testified that the property subject of the Bilihan ng Lupa was meant to secure the payment of an obligation, and not to be sold to respondents, thus:

17. QUESTION: Nasabi mo kanina na isa rin sa dahilan kung bakit ka narito ay upang ipakita ang iyong tunay na kasunduan, at ito ay ang “Bilihan ng Lupa”, maaari mo bang sabihin sa hukumang ito ang dahilan bakit nabuo ang kasunduang ito?
ANSWER: Ako po ay nangailangan ng pera sapagkat ang titulo na nasa pangalan ng aking ina[-]inahan ay unang nakasanla kay Lordita Piamonte. Sa kagustuhan naming ito [ay] matubos, lumapit ako kay Cecilia Carpio at nakiusap ako na kung maaari ay sila muna ang tumubos sa lupa sa halagang ONE HUNDRED THIRTY[-]FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P135,000.00).

18. QUESTION: Ano naman ang reaksyon ni Cecilia Carpio?
ANSWER: Sumang[-]ayon po siya na kaniyang tutubusin ang titulo kay Lordita Piamonte at pagkatapos po ay gumawa siya ng Kasunduan na ang title ay “Bilihan ng Lupa”.

19. QUESTION: Ang sinasabi mo bang “Bilihan ng Lupa” ay ang kasunduang iniabot mo sa akin kanina lamang?
ANSWER: Opo.

20. QUESTION: Sino ang mga taong bumubuo sa kasunduang ito?
ANSWER: Si Primitiva Caamic po, ang mag-asawang Carpio at ako bilang testigo.
 
21. QUESTION: Bilang testigo sa Kasunduan na “Bilihan ng Lupa,” ano ang importanteng bahagi ng kasunduang ito, kung mayroon man?
ANSWER: Iyon pong sinasabi na pwede naming tubusin ang lupa sa loob ng limang taon simula sa pagkasanla noong February 18, 2007 hanggang February 18, 2012.[74]

However, petitioner’s contention that the CA erred in sustaining the transfer of title of the subject property despite the explicit prohibition on stipulation of pactum commissorium, is misplaced.

To be sure, there is no stipulation in the Bilihan ng Lupa which amounts to pactum commissorium whereby ownership of the property will pass to the creditor by the mere default of the debtor. For ready reference, the contract reads:

BILIHAN NG LUPA

Sa kaalaman ng lahat, kami sina PRIMITIV A CAYANAN CAAMIC at ANNALIZA CAAMIC SINGSON, mag-ina, pawang mga nasa hustong gulang at nakatira sa 22 E. Delos Santos St., Block 5, Magsaysay Village, Tondo, Manila, ay nagpapatunay sa mga sumusunod:
Na ako si PRIMITIVA CAYANAN CAAMIC ay nagmamay­ari ng isang piraso ng lote tulad ng pinatutunayan ng SN No. 1877679 at Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 267017 ng Register of Deeds ng Maynila;
Na si ANNALIZA CAAMIC SINGSON ay tinuturing kong anak at ako ay kasalukuyang naninirahan sa nasabing lote;
Na dahil sa pangangailangan namin ng salapi, ipinagbili ko kay CECILIA CAO CARPIO, nasa hustong gulang, may-asawa at naninirahan sa 103 D. Del Pilar St., Block 5, Magsaysay Village, Tondo, Manila ang nasabing lote sa halagang Isang Daan at Tatlumpu’t-Limang Libong Piso (Php 135,000.00) kuwarta ng Pilipinas, sa kasunduang kami ay patuloy na maninirahan sa loob ng limang (5) taon simula ngayong ika-18 ng Pebrero taong 2007. Gayon din ang karapatang bilhin muli ang nasabing pag­aari mula kay CECILIA CAO CARPIO sa halagang Isang Daan at Tatlumpu’t-Limang Libong Piso (Php 135,000.00) kuwarta ng Pilipinas na may interest na 3% kada buwan. Nagkakahalaga ito ng Tatlung Daan at Walumpu’t-Pitong Libong Piso (Php 387,000.00) kuwarta ng Pilipinas sa loob ng Limang (5) taon;
Pagkatapos ng Limang (5) taong kontrata simula ngayong ika-18 ng Pebrero 2007, kami ay obligadong aalis sa nasabing lote at ang kasulatan na pwede naming bilhin muli ay mababalewala. Matatapos ang kasulatang ito sa petsang ika-18 ng Pebrero taong 2012.[75] (Emphasis omitted)
Pertinent portions of the contract indicate the following tenns and conditions: (1) that Primitiva is the owner of the subject property covered by TCT No. 267107; (2) that Primitiva and petitioner, were currently occupying the subject property; (3) that since they need money, Primitiva is selling the subject property to respondent Cecilia Cao Carpio for P135,000.00; (4) that Primitiva and petitioner will continue to live in the subject property for five years starting on February 18, 2007; (5) that Primitiva reserves the right to repurchase the subject property within five years for P135,000.00 plus interest of 3% per month, or for a total amount of P387,000.00; (6) that after five years from the start of the contract on February 18, 2007, or until February 18, 2012, they are obliged to leave the subject property and that the provision on the repurchase thereof will become ineffective. Clearly, there is nothing in the terms and conditions of the Bilihan ng Lupa that provides for the automatic appropriation of the subject property by respondents upon failure to redeem the same.

Nonetheless, when a document appears on its face to be a sale with pacto de retro, the owner of the property may prove that the contract is really a loan with mortgage, by raising as an issue the fact that the document does not express the true intent and agreement of the contracting parties.[76] Upon proof of the truth of the allegations that the instrument was merely given as a security for the repayment of a loan, the courts will enforce the agreement or understanding, in accord with the true intent of the parties at the time the contract was executed, even if the conveyance was accompanied by registration in the name of the transferee and the issuance of a new certificate of title in the latter’s name.[77]

Applying the principle of pactum commissorium to equitable mortgages, the Court ruled in Montevirgen v. Court of Appeals[78] that the consolidation of ownership in the person of the mortgagee in equity, merely upon failure of the mortgagor in equity to pay the obligation, would amount to a pactum commissorium. If a mortgagee in equity desires to obtain title to a mortgaged property, the mortgagee’s proper remedy is to cause the foreclosure of the mortgage in equity and buy it in a foreclosure sale.[79]
 
In Cruz v. Court of Appeals,[80] the Court again reiterated that, in an equitable mortgage, perfect title over the mortgaged property may not be secured in a pactum commissorium fashion, but only by causing the foreclosure of the mortgage and buying the same in an auction sale.[81]

In Spouses Solitarios v. Spouses Jaque,[82] a case involving a complaint for ownership and recovery of possession where the subject property was transferred to the mortgagee in a prohibited pactum commissorium manner, the Court voided the transaction and the registration of the deeds of sale by virtue of which the mortgagee was able to obtain the impugned TCT.[83]

In Dacquel v. Spouses Sotelo,[84] the Court noted that the transaction between the parties was demonstrated to be one of equitable mortgage. It then ruled that therein petitioner did not become the owner of the subject property involved but a mere mortgagee thereof. Thus, therein petitioner was bound by the prohibition against pactum commissorium. Having found that said petitioner proceeded to cause the cancellation of therein respondents’ title to the mortgaged property and its transfer to therein petitioner’s name without availing of the remedy of foreclosure, the Court concluded that said petitioner dabbled in the prohibited practice of pactum commissorium and that the transaction is consequently rendered void, and title to therein subject property should be reverted to therein respondents.

To reiterate, respondents failed to present preponderant evidence to prove that they foreclosed the equitable mortgage denominated as Bilihan ng Lupa and acquired the subject property in a public auction. For failure to present any evidence on how they acquired the subject property from Primitiva, the Court can reasonably conclude that respondents’ acquisition thereof by virtue of the Bilihan ng Lupa amounts to pactum commissorium.

Since respondents’ acquisition of the subject property by virtue of the Bilihan ng Lupa amounts to the prohibited practice of pactum commissorium, the CA erred in affirming the RTC when it sustained the transfer of title thereto under their names. Thus, the title issued under respondents’ names should be nullified and reinstated in the name of Primitiva. After all, in an equitable mortgage, title to the property in issue which has been transferred to the mortgagee actually remains or is transferred back to the owner-mortgagor, conformably to the settled doctrine that the mortgagee does not become the owner of the mortgaged property because ownership thereof remains with the mortgagor pursuant to Art. 2088 of the New Civil Code.[85]
 

Respondents failed to prove their right over the property, possession of the same cannot be awarded in their favor
 
The Court is aware of its ruling in Muñoz v. Ramirez,[86] where it was established that the reciprocal obligations of the parties were under an equitable mortgage. In the said case, the Court ordered the reconveyance of the property to the mortgagor upon the payment of the loan within 90 days from finality of the decision.[87] A similar ruling cannot be rendered in the instant case in view of Primitiva’s death, and the fact that respondents had not been in possession of the subject property. It also bears noting that the records do not reveal any information on Primitiva’s estate.

At any rate, in an accion reivindicatoria, like the complaint filed by respondents, the plaintiff alleges ownership over a parcel of land and seeks recovery of its full possession.[88] It is an action to recover possession of a parcel of land as an element of ownership. In such an action, the basic question is whether the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to prove his/her ownership of the property in question. Like in all civil cases, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish his/her case by preponderance of evidence, which, in the final analysis, means probability of the truth. It is evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto. The plaintiff must rely on the strength of his/her own evidence and not upon the weakness of that of his/her opponent.[89]

Here, respondents failed to present evidence that they had acquired ownership of the subject property through foreclosure of the equitable mortgage and purchase at a public auction. As such, they cannot validly demand upon petitioner to vacate and surrender possession of the subject property and to pay rentals thereon, given that the right to use or enjoy the property and its fruits is one of the attributes of ownership.
 

No basis to award moral damages and attorney’s fees
 
Anent the award of moral damages and attorney’s fees, such civil liability cannot be granted in petitioner’s favor.

Moral damages are recoverable only if the party from whom it is claimed has acted fraudulently or in bad faith or in wanton disregard of his/her contractual obligations.[90] Bad faith, on the other hand, does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence, but imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud.[91]

As to fraud, on the other hand, the rule is that he/she who alleges the same affecting a transaction must substantiate such allegation, since it is presumed that a person takes ordinary care of concerns and that private transactions have been fair and regular.[92] Fraud is never presumed but must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, mere preponderance of evidence not even being adequate.[93] Contentions must be proved by competent evidence and reliance must be had on the strength of the party’s evidence and not upon the weakness of the opponent’s defense.[94] Mere allegation is definitely not evidence.[95]

The Court is not convinced that respondents acted fraudulently or in bad faith in transferring the title of the subject property under their names. Petitioner failed to formally offer in evidence the contracts purportedly conveying the subject property to respondents, namely: (1) the Kasunduan dated February 16, 2007; and (2) the Deed of Sale dated February 18, 2007 which was certified as a forgery by the same notary public who notarized the Bilihan ng Lupa. Petitioner only presented the Bilihan ng Lupa which the Court confirmed to be an equitable mortgage that must first be foreclosed before respondents can acquire ownership thereof in a public auction. What was only established in this case is that the subject property was transferred under respondents’ names in a prohibited pactum commissorium manner, but not through fraudulent means or in bad faith.

Besides, the award of moral damages must be anchored on a clear showing that mental anguish, besmirched reputation, sleepless nights, wounded feelings, or similar injury was actually experienced.[96] There is no better witness to this experience than petitioner herself, but she failed to testify thereon, even in her judicial affidavit. Hence, there is no basis for the award of moral damages.

As for the award of attorney’s fees, Art. 2208 of the New Civil Code provides that in the absence of stipulation, attorney’s fees cannot be recovered, except:

(1)
When exemplary damages are awarded;
(2)
When the defendant’s act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest;
(3)
In criminal cases of malicious prosecution against the plaintiff;
(4)
In case of a clearly unfounded civil action or proceeding against the plaintiff;
(5)
Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff’s plainly valid, just and demandable claim;
(6)
In actions for legal support;
(7)
In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;
(8)
In actions for indemnity under workmen’s compensation and employer’s liability laws;
(9)
In a separate civil action to recover civil liability arising from a crime;
(10)
When at least double judicial costs are awarded;
(11)
In any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.
In all cases, the attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation must be reasonable.

The general rule is that attorney’s fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.[97] Being the exception rather than the rule, an award of such fees requires compelling reason before it may be granted. Even when a claimant is compelled to bring his/her cause to court or incur expenses to protect his/her rights, attorney’s fees still may not be awarded as part of damages where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party’s persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of its cause.[98]

In this case, petitioner neither proven bad faith on the part of respondents nor the existence of an agreement between them as to warrant the award of attorney’s fees. In fine, there is no basis to grant attorney’s fees pursuant to Art. 2208 of the New Civil Code.
 
WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The October 26, 2017 Decision and the April 12, 2018 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 104327 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

[ G.R. No. 255877. March 29, 2023 ]
XXX,[1] PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



GAERLAN, J.:
For resolution is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[3] dated September 12, 2019 and the Resolution[4] dated February 11, 2021 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 41438. The CA in its assailed rulings affirmed the Decision dated November 24, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 94, in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-13802-CR.[5]


An Amended Information dated December 14, 2016 was filed charging XXX for violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9262[6] against his wife, AAA,[7] committed as follows:

That sometime in 2004 to present, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, being the husband of [the] victim, AAA, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit psychological violence and economic abuse upon AAA, by then and there abandoning her and denying her financial support, thereby causing substantial, mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to his wife, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]

XXX pleaded not guilty during his arraignment on April 7, 2017. Trial on the merits ensued.[9]



The prosecution presented as its witnesses AAA and her sister, CCC.[10]

AAA testified that she and XXX were married on October 14, 2002. They rented a house and lived together until 2004 when XXX left the country to work as a seafarer, after which she transferred to her parents’ house. He initially remitted part of his monthly salary to her but stopped after a few months. They last spoke to each other sometime in 2004 when he called and told her to live in the province of Antique with his parents but she refused. For the next 13 years, he failed to communicate with her and send her support which caused her extreme pain and humiliation. She had a sari-sari store but it eventually became bankrupt so she was forced to support herself by earning a living as a freelance massage therapist.[11]

In 2013, CCC saw that XXX was back in the country while standing outside a car wash station. However, despite returning, he did not ask about AAA and never reached out to her.[12]



The defense presented XXX as its sole witness.[13]

XXX testified that he was only forced to marry AAA on October 14, 2002. He was employed as a seafarer from 2004 to 2007 and initially sent remittances to her. However, he had to request his employer to stop making the remittances in 2004 because his parents became sick with cancer. He did not inform AAA that he would stop the remittances because he was traumatized from their frequent fights.[14]

He returned to the country in 2007 and worked as an instructor at the Southern Institute of Maritime in the Philippines. Nevertheless, he did not contact AAA or send her support because he was only forced to marry her.[15]



The RTC rendered its Decision dated November 24, 2017 convicting XXX for violation of Section 5(i) or R.A. No. 9262 due to his denial of financial support to AAA:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 5 paragraph (i) Republic Act No. 9262 otherwise known as the “Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act of 2004” and is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of Two (2) years, Four (4) months and One (1) day of prision correccional as minimum, to six (6) years and One (1) day of prision mayor as maximum and to pay a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) plus costs.

Accused is further ordered to undergo mandatory psychological counselling at the SSDD, Quezon City and to submit proof of compliance thereof to the court.

SO ORDERED.[16]

XXX sought reconsideration of the Decision but was denied by the RTC in its Order dated January 22, 2018.[17]

Undeterred, XXX appealed the Decision.[18]



The CA rendered its Decision[19] dated September 12, 2019 denying the appeal and sustaining XXX’s conviction:

ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated 24 November 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 94, Quezon City in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-13802-CR is AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[20] (Emphases in the original)

The CA held that XXX’s unilateral decision to stop providing AAA financial support and communicating with her undeniably caused her pain and psychological suffering.[21] Even if XXX claimed that he was only forced to marry AAA, he still had the marital obligation to render love and support to her. However, he admitted that he deliberately stopped giving financial support to her which is, by itself, already an act of economic abuse.[22]

XXX filed a Motion for Reconsideration[23] of the Decision but was denied by the CA in its Resolution[24] dated February 11, 2021 for lack of merit.

Hence, the instant petition.

In his petition, XXX primarily argued the following:

1.
The CA erred in convicting him considering there was no prior demand for support. Under Section 47 of R.A. No. 9262, the Revised Penal Code and other applicable laws (e.g., the Family Code) shall have suppletory application. In this regard, just like for any other obligation, demand is necessary before a party can be considered in delay. It therefore cannot be said that XXX was in delay to provide support since he was not apprised by AAA that she needed support.[25]
          
This is supported by Article 203 of the Family Code which provides that “[t]he obligation to give support is demandable from the time the person who has a right to receive the same needs it for maintenance, but it shall not be paid except from the date of judicial or extrajudicial demand.”[26] Article 1169 of the New Civil Code also provides that a party obliged to deliver or to do something shall not be considered in delay until the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands them to fulfill their obligation.[27]
          
2.
The elements of economic abuse are lacking. He did not deny financial support to AAA because there was no demand for him to give it in the first place. He did not commit any overt acts of economic violence to her. When things were no longer smooth between them, she simply took advantage of the law and immediately filed a criminal case against him.[28]
          
3.
Article 100 of the Family Code states that a spouse who leaves the conjugal home or refuses to live there, without just cause, shall not have a right to be supported. In this case, the couple did not establish a conjugal home. Notably, XXX asked AAA to go to the province of Antique to settle down there but it was the latter who refused.[29]
          
4.
Article 68 of the Family provides that both spouses are obliged to support each other, and not one spouse only.[30]
          
5.
Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 should be deemed unconstitutional for being void for vagueness. The law violates the right to due process and leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions.[31]
The State, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed a Comment[32] to the petition. It argued that the petition should be dismissed outright as it raised questions of fact which are improper for petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[33] Regardless, all the elements of the crime were proven and established by the prosecution. The facts are undisputed that around eight months after leaving the country to work as a seafarer, AAA never heard from XXX again. He abandoned her and deliberately withdrew financial support which caused her mental and emotional anguish.[34]

Moreover, it asserted that the marital obligation to provide support does not require prior demand. In any case, a demand from AAA would have been futile since she never heard from XXX after 2004 and no longer knew his whereabouts.[35]



The issue in this case is whether or not XXX is guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262.



The petition is granted. XXX is hereby acquitted.

Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 defines a criminalized mode of psychological violence committed against women and/or children as follows:

SECTION 5. Acts of Violence Against Women and Their Children. — The crime of violence against women and their children is committed through any of the following acts:


(i) Causing mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to the woman or her child, including, but not limited to, repeated verbal and emotional abuse, and denial of financial support or custody of minor children or denial of access to the woman’s child/children.

The Court sitting en banc in the recent landmark case of Acharon v. People[36] (Acharon) provided guidelines for determining what properly constitutes a violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 for cases involving denial of financial support. In this regard, it enumerated the following elements of the crime:

1.
The offended party is a woman and/or her child or children;
          
2.
The woman is either the wife or former wife of the offender, or is a woman with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or is a woman with whom such offender has a common child. As for the woman’s child or children, they may be legitimate or illegitimate, or living within or without the family abode;
          
3.
The offender willfully refuses to give or consciously denies the woman and/or her child or children financial support that is legally due her and/or her child or children; and
4.
The offender denied the woman and/or her child or children the financial support for the purpose of causing the woman and/or her child or children mental or emotional anguish.[37]
It was clarified in Acharon that the commission of this crime through “denial of financial support”[38] is mala in se and thus requires the presence of criminal intent. The mere failure to provide financial support is insufficient to support a conviction. It must be proven that the accused willfully and consciously denied financial support legally due to the woman for the purpose of inflicting mental or emotional anguish upon her. It was pertinently elucidated:

The Court stresses that Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262 uses the phrase “denial of financial support” in defining the criminal act. The word “denial” is defined as “refusal to satisfy a request or desire” or “the act of not allowing someone to do or have something.” The foregoing definitions connote willfulness, or an active exertion of effort so that one would not be able to have or do something. This may be contrasted with the word “failure,” defined as “the fact of not doing something [one] should have done,” which in turn connotes passivity. From the plain meaning of the words used, the act punished by Section 5 (i) is, therefore, dolo in nature — there must be a concurrence between intent, freedom, and intelligence, in order to consummate the crime.

In this connection, the Court deems it proper to clarify, as Associate Justices Amy C. Lazaro-Javier and Mario V. Lopez pointed out in their respective Opinions that the crimes penalized under Section 5 (i) and 5 (e) of R.A. 9262 are mala in se, not mala prohibita, even though R.A. 9262 is a special penal law. The acts punished therein are inherently wrong or depraved, and the language used under the said penal law requires a mental element. Being a crime mala in se, there must thus be a concurrence of both actus reus and mens rea to constitute the crime. “Actus reus pertains to the external or overt acts or omissions included in a crime’s definition while mens rea refers to the accused’s guilty state of mind or criminal intent accompanying the actus reus.”

It is not enough, therefore, for the woman to experience mental or emotional anguish, or for her partner to deny financial support that is legally due her. In order for criminal liability to arise under Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262, insofar as it deals with “denial of financial support,” there must, therefore, be evidence on record that the accused willfully or consciously withheld financial support legally due the woman for the purpose of inflicting mental or emotional anguish upon her. In other words, the actus reus of the offense under Section 5 (i) is the willful denial of financial support, while the mens rea is the intention to inflict mental or emotional anguish upon the woman. Both must thus exist and be proven in court before a person may be convicted of violating Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262.

“It bears emphasis that Section 5 (i) penalizes some forms of psychological violence that are inflicted on victims who are women and children.” In prosecutions under Section 5 (i), therefore, “[p]sychological violence is the means employed by the perpetrator” with denial of financial support as the weapon of choice. In other words, to be punishable by Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262, it must ultimately be proven that the accused had the intent of inflicting mental or emotional anguish upon the woman, thereby inflicting psychological violence upon her, with the willful denial of financial support being the means selected by the accused to accomplish said purpose.

This means that the mere failure or one’s inability to provide financial support is not sufficient to rise to the level of criminality under Section 5 (i), even if mental or emotional anguish is experienced by the woman. In other words, even if the woman were to suffer mental or emotional anguish due to the lack of financial support, but the accused merely failed or was unable to so provide support, then criminal liability would not arise. A contrary interpretation to the foregoing would result in absurd, if not outright unconstitutional, consequences. (Emphases and underscoring supplied; italics in the original; citations omitted)

To reiterate, the mere fact that the accused failed to provide financial support due from him is not punishable under R.A. No. 9262. The normal remedy of a person deprived of financial support is to file a civil case for support against the delinquent person consistent with the provisions of the New Civil Code and the Family Code. However, for criminal liability to arise out of such failure to give support, the facts qualifying the delinquent person’s act of denial or deprivation of financial support must be proven.[39]

As applied in this case, XXX must be acquitted for the prosecution’s failure to establish the third and fourth elements of the crime. Although it is undeniable that he eventually failed to send financial support to AAA, there was no allegation or proof that he did this willfully and deliberately for the purpose of causing her mental and emotional anguish.

It is established that XXX initially sent AAA remittances as financial support from his salary as a seafarer. However, he stopped sending money to her only when his parents became sick with lung cancer and liver cancer and he was constrained to pay for their increasing medical expenses. He testified under oath:

Q:
And you also have documentary evidence to prove that you sent remittances to your wife during this period?
A:
I was not able to send her money anymore because at that time my father was in the hospital for he was sick, ma’am.
          
COURT:
So you stopped the allotment?
          
A:
Yes, your Honor.
          

          
Q [(Public Prosec.]):
So it was knowingly done, Mr. [W]itness? You know for a fact that you were sending remittances and then you requested your company to stop? It was deliberately done?
A:
Yes, ma’am. Kasi po malaki na yang ginagastos ng father ko sa hospital, may liver cancer at saka lung cancer.
          
Q:
And you did not inform your wife that the remittances will be stopped?
A:
We didn’t have communication already in 2004, ma’am.
          

          
Q:
And so you did not communicate with her anymore during that time?
A:
Hindi ko na po kaya makipag-usap sa kanya.[40] (Italics in the original)
It is clear from the foregoing that XXX had a reason why he stopped sending financial support to AAA. The prosecution did not deny this fact and merely insisted that his failure to provide financial support was already sufficient to consummate the crime. XXX further explained that he did not inform her that he would stop sending money because he became traumatized from their frequent fights. He also no longer communicated with her when he returned to the Philippines since he was only forced to marry her in the first place.[41] Hence, his failure to provide financial support was for these reasons and not because he wanted to inflict mental and emotional anguish on AAA.

Further, there is merit in XXX’s claim that he could not have known that AAA needed financial support. Although a formal extrajudicial demand for support is not required under the law, it must be proven that he at least knew that AAA was in need or dependent on him for financial support. This is necessary to prove the prevailing circumstances behind the denial of financial support to bolster the serious accusation that this was utilized as a tool to commit psychological violence against the victim.

In this case, AAA never even tried to reach out to XXX or asked him to provide her financial support. She did not try to communicate with him despite learning from CCC that he was already back in the country.[42] If she truly needed financial support, it is only expected based on human experience that she would have at least exerted efforts to obtain it. The fact that she did not do anything whatsoever to get support prior to filing this criminal case casts serious doubt on her claim that she needed it.

This Court also notes that there can be no presumption for the need for support based on the circumstances of this case. When XXX left to work as a seafarer, he did not have any children with AAA to rear and support. As a couple they also did not have a conjugal house to maintain since AAA returned to live with her parents. They had no standing obligations to pay off. On the contrary, AAA even had a sari-sari store which generated her income. Consequently, XXX cannot be considered in bad faith for presuming that AAA did not need him for support.

AAA’s intentions in immediately filing this criminal case before even making any attempts to obtain financial support is dubious. As aptly pronounced in Acharon, R.A. No. 9262 “was not meant to make the partners of women criminals just because they fail or are unable to financially provide for them.”[43] Also appropriate is Associate Justice Rodil V. Zalameda’s profound insight during the Acharon deliberations that “poverty is not a crime x x x [and] the failure or inability to provide support, without more, should not be the cause of a man’s incarceration.”[44]

Lastly, it bears stressing that the obligation to provide support is imposed by the law mutually upon both spouses.[45] The obligation is not a one-way street for the husband to support his wife. The wife has the identical obligation to provide support to her husband. The law certainly did not intend to impose a heavier burden on the husband to provide support for his wife, or institutionalize criminal prosecution as a measure to enforce support from him.

The CA in its assailed Decision appeared to convict XXX simply because he was gainfully employed as a seafarer and instructor but did not send financial support to AAA.[46] This was an unfair ruling which mistakenly tended to establish a unilateral and not a reciprocal obligation of support between the spouses. It was also based on the erroneous presumption that AAA was dependent solely on XXX to provide her with a dignified life. She was portrayed without any basis as a helpless and incapable person with no choice but to wait idly for 13 years to receive financial support from her estranged husband.

Although R.A. No. 9262 was enacted to protect women, it did not intend to limit or discount their capacity to provide for and support themselves.[47] The law cannot presume that women are weak and disadvantaged victims. AAA was a person fully capable of providing for herself. She was gainfully employed as a massage therapist and owner of a sari-sari store. She was not a destitute victim who had no choice but to depend on her husband’s money to live. It would be gravely erroneous to interpret and apply the law in a manner that will perpetuate gender disparities that should not exist.

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated September 12, 2019 and the Resolution dated February 11, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41438 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner XXX is ACQUITTED of the crime charged. Let an entry of final judgment be issued immediately.

SO ORDERED.

Caguioa, Inting, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.

","An Amended Information dated December 14, 2016 was filed charging XXX for violation of Section 5(i) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9262[6] against his wife, AAA,[7] committed as follows:

That sometime in 2004 to present, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, being the husband of [the] victim, AAA, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit psychological violence and economic abuse upon AAA, by then and there abandoning her and denying her financial support, thereby causing substantial, mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to his wife, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party.

The defense presented XXX as its sole witness.[13]

XXX testified that he was only forced to marry AAA on October 14, 2002. He was employed as a seafarer from 2004 to 2007 and initially sent remittances to her. However, he had to request his employer to stop making the remittances in 2004 because his parents became sick with cancer. He did not inform AAA that he would stop the remittances because he was traumatized from their frequent fights.[14]

He returned to the country in 2007 and worked as an instructor at the Southern Institute of Maritime in the Philippines. Nevertheless, he did not contact AAA or send her support because he was only forced to marry her.[15]",The issue in this case is whether or not XXX is guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262.,"The RTC rendered its Decision dated November 24, 2017 convicting XXX for violation of Section 5(i) or R.A. No. 9262 due to his denial of financial support to AAA:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 5 paragraph (i) Republic Act No. 9262 otherwise known as the “Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act of 2004” and is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of Two (2) years, Four (4) months and One (1) day of prision correccional as minimum, to six (6) years and One (1) day of prision mayor as maximum and to pay a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) plus costs.

Accused is further ordered to undergo mandatory psychological counselling at the SSDD, Quezon City and to submit proof of compliance thereof to the court.

SO ORDERED.[16]

XXX sought reconsideration of the Decision but was denied by the RTC in its Order dated January 22, 2018.[17]

Undeterred, XXX appealed the Decision.[18]

The CA rendered its Decision[19] dated September 12, 2019 denying the appeal and sustaining XXX’s conviction:

ACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated 24 November 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 94, Quezon City in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-13802-CR is AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[20] (Emphases in the original)

The CA held that XXX’s unilateral decision to stop providing AAA financial support and communicating with her undeniably caused her pain and psychological suffering.[21] Even if XXX claimed that he was only forced to marry AAA, he still had the marital obligation to render love and support to her. However, he admitted that he deliberately stopped giving financial support to her which is, by itself, already an act of economic abuse.[22]

XXX filed a Motion for Reconsideration[23] of the Decision but was denied by the CA in its Resolution[24] dated February 11, 2021 for lack of merit.

Hence, the instant petition.

In his petition, XXX primarily argued the following:

1.
The CA erred in convicting him considering there was no prior demand for support. Under Section 47 of R.A. No. 9262, the Revised Penal Code and other applicable laws (e.g., the Family Code) shall have suppletory application. In this regard, just like for any other obligation, demand is necessary before a party can be considered in delay. It therefore cannot be said that XXX was in delay to provide support since he was not apprised by AAA that she needed support.[25]
          
This is supported by Article 203 of the Family Code which provides that “[t]he obligation to give support is demandable from the time the person who has a right to receive the same needs it for maintenance, but it shall not be paid except from the date of judicial or extrajudicial demand.”[26] Article 1169 of the New Civil Code also provides that a party obliged to deliver or to do something shall not be considered in delay until the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands them to fulfill their obligation.[27]
          
2.
The elements of economic abuse are lacking. He did not deny financial support to AAA because there was no demand for him to give it in the first place. He did not commit any overt acts of economic violence to her. When things were no longer smooth between them, she simply took advantage of the law and immediately filed a criminal case against him.[28]
          
3.
Article 100 of the Family Code states that a spouse who leaves the conjugal home or refuses to live there, without just cause, shall not have a right to be supported. In this case, the couple did not establish a conjugal home. Notably, XXX asked AAA to go to the province of Antique to settle down there but it was the latter who refused.[29]
          
4.
Article 68 of the Family provides that both spouses are obliged to support each other, and not one spouse only.[30]
          
5.
Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 should be deemed unconstitutional for being void for vagueness. The law violates the right to due process and leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions.[31]
The State, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed a Comment[32] to the petition. It argued that the petition should be dismissed outright as it raised questions of fact which are improper for petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[33] Regardless, all the elements of the crime were proven and established by the prosecution. The facts are undisputed that around eight months after leaving the country to work as a seafarer, AAA never heard from XXX again. He abandoned her and deliberately withdrew financial support which caused her mental and emotional anguish.[34]

Moreover, it asserted that the marital obligation to provide support does not require prior demand. In any case, a demand from AAA would have been futile since she never heard from XXX after 2004 and no longer knew his whereabouts.[35]

The petition is granted. XXX is hereby acquitted.

Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 defines a criminalized mode of psychological violence committed against women and/or children as follows:

SECTION 5. Acts of Violence Against Women and Their Children. — The crime of violence against women and their children is committed through any of the following acts:

x x x x

(i) Causing mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to the woman or her child, including, but not limited to, repeated verbal and emotional abuse, and denial of financial support or custody of minor children or denial of access to the woman’s child/children.

The Court sitting en banc in the recent landmark case of Acharon v. People[36] (Acharon) provided guidelines for determining what properly constitutes a violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 for cases involving denial of financial support. In this regard, it enumerated the following elements of the crime:

1.
The offended party is a woman and/or her child or children;
 	 
2.
The woman is either the wife or former wife of the offender, or is a woman with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or is a woman with whom such offender has a common child. As for the woman’s child or children, they may be legitimate or illegitimate, or living within or without the family abode;
 	 
3.
The offender willfully refuses to give or consciously denies the woman and/or her child or children financial support that is legally due her and/or her child or children; and
4.
The offender denied the woman and/or her child or children the financial support for the purpose of causing the woman and/or her child or children mental or emotional anguish.[37]
It was clarified in Acharon that the commission of this crime through “denial of financial support”[38] is mala in se and thus requires the presence of criminal intent. The mere failure to provide financial support is insufficient to support a conviction. It must be proven that the accused willfully and consciously denied financial support legally due to the woman for the purpose of inflicting mental or emotional anguish upon her. It was pertinently elucidated:

The Court stresses that Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262 uses the phrase “denial of financial support” in defining the criminal act. The word “denial” is defined as “refusal to satisfy a request or desire” or “the act of not allowing someone to do or have something.” The foregoing definitions connote willfulness, or an active exertion of effort so that one would not be able to have or do something. This may be contrasted with the word “failure,” defined as “the fact of not doing something [one] should have done,” which in turn connotes passivity. From the plain meaning of the words used, the act punished by Section 5 (i) is, therefore, dolo in nature — there must be a concurrence between intent, freedom, and intelligence, in order to consummate the crime.

In this connection, the Court deems it proper to clarify, as Associate Justices Amy C. Lazaro-Javier and Mario V. Lopez pointed out in their respective Opinions that the crimes penalized under Section 5 (i) and 5 (e) of R.A. 9262 are mala in se, not mala prohibita, even though R.A. 9262 is a special penal law. The acts punished therein are inherently wrong or depraved, and the language used under the said penal law requires a mental element. Being a crime mala in se, there must thus be a concurrence of both actus reus and mens rea to constitute the crime. “Actus reus pertains to the external or overt acts or omissions included in a crime’s definition while mens rea refers to the accused’s guilty state of mind or criminal intent accompanying the actus reus.”

It is not enough, therefore, for the woman to experience mental or emotional anguish, or for her partner to deny financial support that is legally due her. In order for criminal liability to arise under Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262, insofar as it deals with “denial of financial support,” there must, therefore, be evidence on record that the accused willfully or consciously withheld financial support legally due the woman for the purpose of inflicting mental or emotional anguish upon her. In other words, the actus reus of the offense under Section 5 (i) is the willful denial of financial support, while the mens rea is the intention to inflict mental or emotional anguish upon the woman. Both must thus exist and be proven in court before a person may be convicted of violating Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262.

“It bears emphasis that Section 5 (i) penalizes some forms of psychological violence that are inflicted on victims who are women and children.” In prosecutions under Section 5 (i), therefore, “[p]sychological violence is the means employed by the perpetrator” with denial of financial support as the weapon of choice. In other words, to be punishable by Section 5 (i) of R.A. 9262, it must ultimately be proven that the accused had the intent of inflicting mental or emotional anguish upon the woman, thereby inflicting psychological violence upon her, with the willful denial of financial support being the means selected by the accused to accomplish said purpose.

This means that the mere failure or one’s inability to provide financial support is not sufficient to rise to the level of criminality under Section 5 (i), even if mental or emotional anguish is experienced by the woman. In other words, even if the woman were to suffer mental or emotional anguish due to the lack of financial support, but the accused merely failed or was unable to so provide support, then criminal liability would not arise. A contrary interpretation to the foregoing would result in absurd, if not outright unconstitutional, consequences. (Emphases and underscoring supplied; italics in the original; citations omitted)

To reiterate, the mere fact that the accused failed to provide financial support due from him is not punishable under R.A. No. 9262. The normal remedy of a person deprived of financial support is to file a civil case for support against the delinquent person consistent with the provisions of the New Civil Code and the Family Code. However, for criminal liability to arise out of such failure to give support, the facts qualifying the delinquent person’s act of denial or deprivation of financial support must be proven.[39]

As applied in this case, XXX must be acquitted for the prosecution’s failure to establish the third and fourth elements of the crime. Although it is undeniable that he eventually failed to send financial support to AAA, there was no allegation or proof that he did this willfully and deliberately for the purpose of causing her mental and emotional anguish.

It is established that XXX initially sent AAA remittances as financial support from his salary as a seafarer. However, he stopped sending money to her only when his parents became sick with lung cancer and liver cancer and he was constrained to pay for their increasing medical expenses. He testified under oath:

Q:
And you also have documentary evidence to prove that you sent remittances to your wife during this period?
A:
I was not able to send her money anymore because at that time my father was in the hospital for he was sick, ma’am.
 	 
COURT:
So you stopped the allotment?
 	 
A:
Yes, your Honor.
 	 
x x x x
 	 
Q [(Public Prosec.]):
So it was knowingly done, Mr. [W]itness? You know for a fact that you were sending remittances and then you requested your company to stop? It was deliberately done?
A:
Yes, ma’am. Kasi po malaki na yang ginagastos ng father ko sa hospital, may liver cancer at saka lung cancer.
 	 
Q:
And you did not inform your wife that the remittances will be stopped?
A:
We didn’t have communication already in 2004, ma’am.
 	 
x x x x
 	 
Q:
And so you did not communicate with her anymore during that time?
A:
Hindi ko na po kaya makipag-usap sa kanya.[40] (Italics in the original)
It is clear from the foregoing that XXX had a reason why he stopped sending financial support to AAA. The prosecution did not deny this fact and merely insisted that his failure to provide financial support was already sufficient to consummate the crime. XXX further explained that he did not inform her that he would stop sending money because he became traumatized from their frequent fights. He also no longer communicated with her when he returned to the Philippines since he was only forced to marry her in the first place.[41] Hence, his failure to provide financial support was for these reasons and not because he wanted to inflict mental and emotional anguish on AAA.

Further, there is merit in XXX’s claim that he could not have known that AAA needed financial support. Although a formal extrajudicial demand for support is not required under the law, it must be proven that he at least knew that AAA was in need or dependent on him for financial support. This is necessary to prove the prevailing circumstances behind the denial of financial support to bolster the serious accusation that this was utilized as a tool to commit psychological violence against the victim.

In this case, AAA never even tried to reach out to XXX or asked him to provide her financial support. She did not try to communicate with him despite learning from CCC that he was already back in the country.[42] If she truly needed financial support, it is only expected based on human experience that she would have at least exerted efforts to obtain it. The fact that she did not do anything whatsoever to get support prior to filing this criminal case casts serious doubt on her claim that she needed it.

This Court also notes that there can be no presumption for the need for support based on the circumstances of this case. When XXX left to work as a seafarer, he did not have any children with AAA to rear and support. As a couple they also did not have a conjugal house to maintain since AAA returned to live with her parents. They had no standing obligations to pay off. On the contrary, AAA even had a sari-sari store which generated her income. Consequently, XXX cannot be considered in bad faith for presuming that AAA did not need him for support.

AAA’s intentions in immediately filing this criminal case before even making any attempts to obtain financial support is dubious. As aptly pronounced in Acharon, R.A. No. 9262 “was not meant to make the partners of women criminals just because they fail or are unable to financially provide for them.”[43] Also appropriate is Associate Justice Rodil V. Zalameda’s profound insight during the Acharon deliberations that “poverty is not a crime x x x [and] the failure or inability to provide support, without more, should not be the cause of a man’s incarceration.”[44]

Lastly, it bears stressing that the obligation to provide support is imposed by the law mutually upon both spouses.[45] The obligation is not a one-way street for the husband to support his wife. The wife has the identical obligation to provide support to her husband. The law certainly did not intend to impose a heavier burden on the husband to provide support for his wife, or institutionalize criminal prosecution as a measure to enforce support from him.

The CA in its assailed Decision appeared to convict XXX simply because he was gainfully employed as a seafarer and instructor but did not send financial support to AAA.[46] This was an unfair ruling which mistakenly tended to establish a unilateral and not a reciprocal obligation of support between the spouses. It was also based on the erroneous presumption that AAA was dependent solely on XXX to provide her with a dignified life. She was portrayed without any basis as a helpless and incapable person with no choice but to wait idly for 13 years to receive financial support from her estranged husband.

Although R.A. No. 9262 was enacted to protect women, it did not intend to limit or discount their capacity to provide for and support themselves.[47] The law cannot presume that women are weak and disadvantaged victims. AAA was a person fully capable of providing for herself. She was gainfully employed as a massage therapist and owner of a sari-sari store. She was not a destitute victim who had no choice but to depend on her husband’s money to live. It would be gravely erroneous to interpret and apply the law in a manner that will perpetuate gender disparities that should not exist.

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated September 12, 2019 and the Resolution dated February 11, 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 41438 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner XXX is ACQUITTED of the crime charged. Let an entry of final judgment be issued immediately.

F/DIR. ROGELIO F. ASIGNADO (RET.), F/DIR. JOSE E. COLLADO (RET.), AND CINSP. ERNESTO S. PAGDANGANAN, PETITIONERS, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTED BY CONCHITA CARPIO MORALES AND F/CSUPT. CARLITO S. ROMERO (RET.), RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



GAERLAN, J.:
Before the Court is an original Petition for Certiorari[1] filed as a direct recourse from the Office of the Ombudsman’s (public respondent’s) rulings vis-à-vis Case Nos. OMB-P-C-13-0269 and OMB-P-A-13-0310. Said rulings, i.e., public respondent’s Joint Resolution[2] dated June 20, 2014 and Joint Order[3] dated December 21, 2015, effectively dismissed both the criminal and administrative charges against Fire Chief Superintendent (F/CSupt.) Carlito S. Romero (private respondent) as alleged by Director (F/Dir.) Rogelio F. Asignado (Ret.; Asignado), (F/Dir.) Jose E. Collado (Ret.; Collado), and Fire Chief Inspector Ernesto S. Pagdanganan (collectively, petitioners).


In their Complaint-Affidavit[4] filed before public respondent, petitioners along with nine other complainants[5] basically alleged the following:
1)
At the time of filing, they were officers and members of the Board of Trustees of the Bureau of Fire Protection Mutual Aid & Beneficiary Association, Inc. (BFPMBAI), with the exception of F/Dir. Asignado (BFPMBAI’s founder and chairman emeritus).[6]
          
2)
A Memorandum of Agreement[7] (MOA) was entered into between BFPMBAI and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) on March 6, 2006, whereby the latter undertook to periodically deduct from the respective payroll salaries of all BFP personnel with membership in the former, and to remit said deductions to the former as soon as practicable. Said MOA was signed by F/Dir. Asignado as BFP Chief and by private respondent as BFPMBAI President at the time.[8]
          
3)
Said deductions and remittances by the BFP had proceeded without any problems until the start of February 2013, when the BFPMBAI Board of Directors came to know of the non-remittance of deductions for the month of January 2013.[9] F/Dir. Collado, as BFPMBAI President at the time, sent a Letter[10] dated February 5, 2013 to private respondent (who was BFP Officer-in-Charge at the time) invoking the MOA for the immediate release of the said remittances.[11]
          
4)
On February 8, 2013, private respondent issued a Memorandum[12] to the BFP Cash Management Division Chief with the following tenor:
          
Pending legal resolution as to the legitimate sets of officers that would administer the affairs of the Bureau of Fire Protection Mutual Benefit Association (BFP MBAI), the deduction from the Continuous Form Checks (CFCs) for salaries and allowances of BFP personnel nation-wide is hereby temporarily stopped effective February 2013.
 
          
The amounts deducted for BFP MBAI Contribution and BFP MBAI Salary Loan under deduction codes D116 and A117, respectively from the January 2013 CFCs should be refunded immediately.
 
          
The MBAI deductions shall resume only when a notice or memorandum for its resumption is served.
 
          
For strict compliance.[13]
          
5)
Said legal controversy has its origins in the 6th BFPMBAI General Membership Meeting held on June 30, 2012, which was also the forum for the election of the nine members of the BFPMBAI Board of Trustees.[14] According to the undated Report[15] of the BFPMBAI Committee on Elections (BFPBMAI COMELEC), only 167 voters were present, but the votes of 2,840 absent members were cast by the presiding officer (i.e., Fire Chief Superintendent F/CSupt. Danilo R. Cabrera, a supposed ally of private respondent vis-à-vis the said elections) in favor of private respondent and other candidates allied with the latter. BFPMBAI COMELEC did not proclaim any winners, and duly ruled that the election was to have a “status quo ante order” in light of queries likely to be filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).[16] Petitioners and their fellow complainants still assumed and administered the affairs of BFPMBAI despite the actions coming from the camp of private respondent, since they viewed the additional votes and new tally as without basis.[17]
          
6)
F/Dir. Collado sent another Letter[18] dated February 20, 2013, this time to the BFP Cash Management Division Chief, in order to inquire into the BFP’s refusal of remitting the deductions due to BFPMBAI.[19] With no reply to either of Petitioner Collado’s Letters, due efforts were subsequently made to communicate with private respondent in person. Petitioners and their fellow complainants thus alleged that “[i]n all the meetings attended by the [private] respondent, he expressly and categorically declared that he will release the remittance due for the association on the condition that he will be the one to sit as its chairman and all the voted-out trustees shall assume, though illegal[ly], as members of the board.”[20]
          
7)
Additionally, on March 8, 2013, petitioners and their fellow complainants (acting as BFPMBAI’s Board of Trustees) issued BFPMBAI Board of Trustees’ Resolution No. 13-04,[21] which accepted the sudden resignation of F/CSupt. Ruben F. Bearis (Bearis) as Vice Chairman for Administration and Trustee (submitted for personal reasons) and electing private respondent as F/CSupt. Bearis’ replacement. Said Resolution was allegedly issued to accommodate private respondent, whose “continuing intimidation, compulsion, and insistence” had “compelled” petitioners and their fellow complainants to sign the supposedly unlawful Resolution.[22] Private respondent also allegedly continued to work towards the reinstatement of his fellow Trustees that were not re-elected during the June 30, 2012 election, but to no avail due to the resistance of petitioners and their fellow complainants.[23]
          
8)
As of March 27, 2013, the accumulated deductions due for remittance to BFPMBAI had amounted to P18,595,384.23, and thus, by reason of private respondent’s “malicious and intentional acts, x x x lending operations and payment of insurance premiums for the members were suspended for absence of funds. The supposed profits from the withheld remittances remained unrealized as these funds were never distributed in the form of loans to its members. Payment of interests in favor of creditors were likewise suspended, hence, the association incurred additional liabilities or burden in the form of surcharges and penalties.”[24]
          
9)
Thus, “[f]or exhibiting malice and evident bad faith in withholding the release, after due demands or requests, of remittance that caused grave damage, prejudice, and injury to the association,”[25] petitioners and their fellow complainants alleged that private respondent violated Sections 3(e)[26] and 3(f)[27] of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft & Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Article 286[28] of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for “maliciously compelling the incumbent trustees against their will, through threats or intimidation of withholding the release of remittance, to execute a resolution authorizing the assumption into office of the respondent and all the voted-out trustees during the General Assembly.”[29] Petitioners and their fellow complainants also prayed that private respondent be correspondingly disciplined for the administrative offenses of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, oppression, and grave abuse of authority.[30]
For his part, private respondent stated in his Counter-Affidavit[31] the following:
1)
He was indeed designated as BFP’s Officer-in-Charge on January 11, 2013, and upon his assumption of duties, he learned that petitioners and their fellow Complainants had taken over the management of BFPMBAI despite the BFPMBAI COMELEC’s “status quo ante order.”[32] He had also previously received a Letter-Reply[33] dated October 19, 2012 from the SEC vis-à-vis his request for legal opinion regarding the BFPMBAI election controversy, wherein the SEC refrained from rendering said legal opinion due to its possible effect on the substantive rights of parties in a potential controversy before a court of competent jurisdiction, but gave guidance by pointing out that a majority of the bona fide members of BFPMBAI were not present during the election and general members’ meeting.[34]
          
2)
On March 14, 2013, in his capacity as BFP Officer-in-Charge, he met with representatives from Fortune Life Insurance Co., Inc. Said meeting resulted in an agreement-in-principle between BFP and the said insurance company for the former’s release to the latter of the insurance premium payments of BFPMBAI members in anticipation of the case to be filed by private respondent relative to the BFPMBAI election controversy.[35] Said agreement-in-principle is evidenced by the Minutes of Meeting[36] attached to private respondent’s Counter-Affidavit.
          
3)
On March 21, 2013, private respondent indeed filed a Complaint-in-Interpleader,[37] which was raffled off to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (Branch 80) and docketed as Civil Case No. Q-13-72923. Said Complaint-in-Interpleader was directed against the two competing groups both claiming to be the legitimate BFPMBAI Board of Trustees, and prayed for the “deposit of the outstanding remittances of the monthly dues collected so far from [BFPMBAI] members, representing remittances [for] the months of January and February and March 2013 to [the] Court, and considering the release thereof to whomever of defendants is entitled to the same.”[38]
          
Incidentally, and at the time of private respondent’s filing of his Counter-Affidavit, RTC-Quezon City (Branch 80) had issued on July 15, 2013 an Order[39] issuing a Writ of Preliminary injunction against petitioners and their fellow complainants in order to restrain them from conducting business as BFPMBAI’s Board of Trustees during the pendency of the case (unless otherwise authorized, and conditioned upon the posting of a bond of P10,000,000.00 by the group of officers and trustees allied with private respondent).[40]
          
4)
Addressing the Complaint-Affidavit’s allegation of violating R.A. No. 3019 and of committing the corresponding multiple administrative offenses, Private respondent puts forth the following affirmative defense:
          
5. In issuing the Memorandum for the temporary stoppage of the remittance of BFPMBAI contributions, I did not employ intimidation nor was the same done without legal basis or justified cause. It bears to stress out [sic] that the herein complainants took over the management of the BFPMBAI in blatant disregard of the COMELEC’s Status Quo Ante Order. Needless to say, the same is unlawful, unauthorized and without any legal color. Instead of succumbing to complainant’s baseless threats and prodding, I opted to exercise prudent management in order to protect the rights and interests of the association and its members. A careful perusal of the Memorandum would show that the same was resorted to pending legal resolution as to the legitimate sets of officers that would administer the affairs of the BFPMBAI. I should not be blamed for doing that because the complainants themselves admitted in their complaint that they “assumed and administered the affairs of the association” since July 2012 (paragraph 16 of the Complaint). Corollary to their assumption is the fact that they have been disbursing funds albeit their illegal assumption. It would be an irresponsible act, on the other hand, to just release the funds in the middle of a legal controversy. Suffice it to say, the Memorandum I issued was done without malice but well within the exercise of a lawful right.
 
          
6. Moreover, the funds representing the monthly contributions were not squandered as the same were reverted to the Bureau of [the] Treasury and may be withdrawn any time after the issue brought before the RTC has been settled. Copy of the Certification[41] is hereto attached as Annex “F.”[42] (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)
 
          
5)
As to the Complaint-Affidavit’s accusation of grave coercion, private respondent denies that he ever committed any actions amounting to the same, viz.:
          
7. Furthermore, complainants’ allegation that I withheld the release of the remittance[s] in order to force the complainants to authorize the assumption into office of the other group is a brazen lie. Such averment is not only a product of their polluted mind but runs counter to the attending circumstances. Clear is the ground that the remittances were held in abeyance pending resolution of the conflicting claims of the two contending parties.
 
          
8. Neither is complainants’ allegation true with respect to their statement that I insisted, intimidated and compelled the Board of Trustees to sign a resolution declaring me as a trustee vice F/CSupt. Ruben F. Bearis. Firstly, I did not even insinuate, much more [sic] compel, intimidate or insist to be declared trustee together with the complainants. It is highly improbable considering the fact that there is a pending legal question as to who [sic] or which group is the legitimate officers of the BFPMBAI. Secondly, the issuance of the alleged resolution should not be attributed to me because I have no personal knowledge as to what transpires in their circle. The supposed Resolution No. 13-04 was issued without my knowledge and thirdly, the said resolution is self-serving. Worthy to note also is the fact that the alleged Resolution was issued on 08 March 2013, after our 05 March 2013 meeting when we came up with a solution to address the association’s problem. Clearly, it was the complainants who had a change of heart and eventually reneged on their commitment to honor the Status Quo Ante Order issued by the COMELEC. For all we know, the issued resolution was resorted to by the herein complainants to implicate me some way or another, as they have done in the instant case.[43]

Overall, private respondent sought public respondent’s dismissal of all the charges filed against him—both criminal and administrative.[44]


After further consideration of the Position Papers of both petitioners (and their fellow complainants)[45] and private respondent,[46] public respondent promulgated its Joint Resolution[47] dated June 20, 2014 with the following dispositive portion:

WHEREFORE, both the criminal and administrative charges against F/CSUPT. CARLITO S. ROMERO are DISMISSED.

SO ORDERED.[48]

Public respondent gave the following reasons:

The Election Rules and Regulations of the BFPMBAI states [sic] that the “winning candidates, their election being final and immediately executory after due certification by the Committee on Elections, will be announced and will be inducted into office immediately by the Comelec Chairman.” Here, there was no certification and induction of the winning candidates because a status quo ante order was issued by the COMELEC taking note that only 167 out of 3,007 members attended the General Assembly coupled with the issue on [sic] whether the Presiding Officer could cast the votes of the 2,840 absent members. Such being the case, it was then apparent that a legal controversy indeed existed as to who should be recognized as the legitimate Board of Trustees of the Association. Corollary thereto, is the issue of who should be entitled to receive the remittances from the BFP. Given this scenario, respondent was justified in withholding the release of remittances and instead filing a case for Interpleader because it is one of the remedies provided under the law. It only shows that he recognized the jurisdiction of the courts in settling the dispute between the contending officers, which issue was beyond his power to decide. As the Officer-in-Charge of the BFP and as a member of BFPMBAI, respondent was duty-bound to protect the interest of the members and ensure that the remittances will go to the proper parties. Taking into account that the complaint in Interpleader, together with the main case filed by the contending sets of Trustees, are now pending trial before Branch 80, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, any issue arising therefrom especially on the propriety of releasing the remittances is already covered by the sub judice rule.

Moreover, complainants failed to satisfactorily show that respondent was motivated by ill will in withholding the remittances since he did not benefit from the money withheld by the BFP. In fact, as certified by the BFP Chief Accountant, Gina H. Gonzales, the cash allocation intended for the monthly remittances of BFPMBAI Contribution and Salary Loan Deductions from January to June 2013 were reverted to the Bureau of [the] Treasury.[49]

Petitioners and their fellow complainants duly filed their Motion for Reconsideration[50] relative to the aforementioned dismissal, which had three main arguments:
1)
Private respondent’s proper recourse vis-à-vis the BFPMBAI election was actually an intra-corporate controversy cognizable before the appropriate RTC. Since no intra-corporate controversy was filed by private respondent or anyone from his camp within 15 days from the election on June 30, 2012 (in accordance with Rule 6, Section 3[51] of A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC [dated 13 March 2001], otherwise known as the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies), petitioners and their fellow complainants assert that they are the legitimate Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI, and thus, private respondent had no valid ground to withhold the remittances. Moreover, even if there was doubt as to their legitimacy as the rightful Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI, the association itself has a legal personality separate and distinct from its governing board.[52]
          
2)
Private respondent had previously secured a loan from BFPMBAI while it was being managed by petitioners and their fellow complainants, as evidenced by private respondent’s Loan Application Form[53] dated August 3, 2012 for the amount of P250,000.00 (and approved on behalf of the BFPMBAI Board of Trustees by F/Dir. Collado). Petitioners and their fellow complainants thus, essentially argued, that this was an admission against private respondent’s own interest.[54]
          
3)
The remittances due BFPMBAI are actually already property of BFPMBAI members, which could no longer be withheld and reverted back to the Bureau of the Treasury by BFP. Private respondent thus, had no legal grounds for his actions in stopping their payment.[55]
In its Joint Order[56] dated December 21, 2015, public respondent denied the said Motion for Reconsideration, viz.:
WHEREFORE, complainants’ Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. Accordingly, the Joint Resolution dated June 20, 2014 STANDS.

SO ORDERED.[57]

Public respondent reasoned that private respondent’s filing of the Complaint-in-Interpleader was appropriate considering the circumstances, and that its ultimate goal was “not intended to challenge a Board member’s claim to an elective office, but rather to ascertain which set of BFPMBAI Board of Trustees was legitimately entitled to receive the payroll deductions of its members.”[58] Aggrieved, Petitioners went on direct recourse to this Court via the instant original Petition for Certiorari.[59]



Petitioners (who are only three of the original complainants) put forth the following submissions in support of their theory that public respondent erred in dismissing all charges against private respondent:

1)
In reiteration of their first argument before public respondent in their Motion for Reconsideration below, petitioners assert that private respondent never questioned the election of their camp as the rightful and legitimate Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI with the proper intra-corporate controversy before the appropriate RTC, and thus, their supposed election could no longer be questioned. Hence, private respondent had no legal grounds to order the stoppage of payments vis-à-vis the remittances due BFPMBAI. Moreover, any doubt as to their legitimacy as the rightful Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI was irrelevant given the separate and distinct legal personality of BFPMBAI from its Board of Trustees. Petitioners thus mean that the remittances would go to BFPMBAI as an institution, and not just into the hands of its Board of Trustees.[60]
2)
In relation to the aforementioned, private respondent thus, could no longer validly file the Complaint-in-Interpleader now under the jurisdiction of RTC-Quezon City (Branch 80). Said case could not be a substitute for the intra-corporate controversy/election contest that private respondent should have filed. Moreover, petitioners reiterate private respondent’s supposed admission and recognition of their authority as the Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI through his loan application from the association in 2012.[61]
3)
Relative to the legal nature of the remittances due BFPMBAI, petitioners again raise their theory that the same is already private property rightfully pertaining to BFPMBAI members once they have been placed at their disposal, i.e., deposited into their automated teller machine accounts with Land Bank of the Philippines. Thus, private respondent had no legal ground to stop their payment as agreed under the MOA between BFP and BFPMBAI.[62]
In his Comment,[63] private respondent counter-asserts that public respondent committed neither any reversible error nor any grave abuse of discretion when it rendered its rulings dismissing both the criminal and administrative charges against him. Private Respondent also points out the crucial fact that the BFPMBAI COMELEC never proclaimed any winners relative to the elections held on June 30, 2012, and instead of certifying any winner thereto, said committee issued its “status quo ante order.” Due to this unresolved electoral controversy, and the resulting separate sets of BFPMBAI officers and trustees, private respondent was compelled to act accordingly by ordering the stoppage of remittances and filing the Complaint-in-Interpleader. Due to his recognition of the jurisdiction of the appropriate court over the legal question of which set of officers and/or trustees would rightly be entitled to administer BFPMBAI’s finances and receive the remittances, private respondent insists that he was acting on behalf of the interests of both BFP (as its Officer-in-Charge) and BFPMBAI (as a member). Moreover, there was no showing of any ill will on his part relative to the stoppage of payment of the said remittances. He prays that the instant petition should thus accordingly be dismissed.[64]

In its Manifestation and Motion[65] filed by the Office of the Solicitor General, public respondent respectfully submits that it need not participate further in the proceedings of instant Petition pursuant to Rule 65, Section 5[66] of the 1997 Rules of Court. Since Public Respondent is merely a nominal party, it should be excused from being required to file a comment. The Court noted and granted public respondent’s request via its Resolution[67] dated August 1, 2018.

In their Reply,[68] Petitioners reiterate their stance that public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion when it rendered its rulings dismissing all charges against private respondent—despite the “presence of overwhelming evidence”[69] against the latter. They add to their submission their recent discovery of the supposed influence, partiality, personal bias, and strong connections of former Deputy Ombudsman for the Military & Other Law Enforcement Offices Cyril E. Ramos (Deputy Ombudsman Ramos) relative to the case,[70] viz.:

9. True to their words and to our surprise, we discovered that the incumbent Deputy Ombudsman for the MOLEO in the person of ATTY. CYRIL E. RAMOS, was a former financial consultant of respondent Romero during the time when the latter was the Officer-in-Charge of the BFP. It may be well to emphasize that the administrative and criminal charges subject of this petition were filed before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the MOLEO. In this case[,] where personal connection and influence exists between private respondent Romero and Deputy Ombudsman Ramos, herein petitioners were not surprised why it favoured respondent Romero despite the presence of overwhelming evidence against him. Copy of the SERVICE AGREEMENT[71] between respondent Romero and ATTY. CYRIL E. RAMOS dated 02 September 2013 is hereto attached and marked as ANNEX L;[72]

In effect, petitioners offer no new arguments aside from the alleged bias and supposedly inappropriate connection between former Deputy Ombudsman Ramos and Private Respondent during the pendency of proceedings before Public Respondent.



The sole issue for the Court’s consideration here is whether or not public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing both the criminal and administrative charges filed against private respondent.



The Court rules in the negative, and accordingly, the instant petition must be dismissed for lack of merit.

At the outset, the Court first must note that public respondent’s dismissal of the administrative charges against private respondent vis-à-vis Case No. OMB-P-A-13-0310 has already attained finality. This is because petitioners cannot seek direct recourse from the Court relative to public respondent’s said dismissal, which is only applicable to the criminal aspect of public respondent’s rulings. The Court had already clarified in Joson v. Office of the Ombudsman[73] that the proper remedy to assail the complete exoneration or absolution of a respondent in an administrative case decided by the Ombudsman is to file an original petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals.[74] Thus, the Court lacks jurisdiction to touch upon the administrative aspect of public respondent’s rulings here.

With regard to the criminal aspect of public respondent’s rulings vis-à-vis Case No. OMB-P-C-13-0269, the Court is reminded of its fairly recent ruling in Yatco v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon,[75] which reiterated the jurisprudential lineage summed up in Gatchalian v. Office of the Ombudsman[76] relative to the Court’s own and proper jurisdiction over original petitions for certiorari to assail the Ombudsman’s rulings in criminal cases involving findings of probable cause (or lack thereof). The Court also clarified in the remedies available to a party wishing to question a consolidated ruling of the Ombudsman (i.e., which disposed of both criminal and administrative aspects of a case), viz.:

As consolidation is a matter for the court to determine post-filing, it does not affect the nature of the procedural recourse taken by the aggrieved party. Here, when the Ombudsman consolidated the criminal and administrative charges against respondents, it deemed it proper to resolve both criminal and administrative aspects in one Joint Resolution because the charges involved common questions of fact or law. Ordinarily, administrative and criminal charges filed before the Ombudsman would usually pertain to one incident involving the same set of facts and parties, from which both criminal and administrative liabilities may stem. This gives rise to their consolidation. However, after the Ombudsman renders its consolidated ruling, the aggrieved party is then required to take the appropriate procedural remedies to separately assail the administrative and criminal components of the same. Clearly, a Rule 65 certiorari petition (which is the proper remedy to assail the criminal aspect of the Ombudsman ruling; or the administrative aspect of an unappealable Ombudsman ruling) is clearly different from a Rule 43 appeal (which is the proper remedy to assail the administrative aspect of an appealable ruling).[77]

Thus, the Court only has jurisdiction over the instant Petition vis-à-vis its criminal aspect. In other words, the Court now presently considers the sole issue proper, i.e., whether or not Public Respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in finding no probable cause to charge private respondent for violation of Sections 3(e) and 3(f) of R.A. No. 3019, as well as Article 286 of the RPC.

The Court’s jurisdiction to review and check any grave abuse of discretion relative to the prosecutorial powers of the Ombudsman is circumscribed by jurisprudential precedent that affirms constitutional and legislative fiat. In Casing v. Ombudsman,[78] the Court expounded thus:

The Constitution and R.A. No. 6770 endowed the Office of the Ombudsman with wide latitude, in the exercise of its investigatory and prosecutory powers, to pass upon criminal complaints involving public officials and employees. Specifically, the determination of whether probable cause exists is a function that belongs to the Office of the Ombudsman. Whether a criminal case, given its attendant facts and circumstances, should be filed or not is basically its call.

As a general rule, the Court does not interfere with the Office of the Ombudsman’s exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers, and respects the initiative and independence inherent in the Office of the Ombudsman which, “beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of the public service.” While the Ombudsman’s findings as to whether probable cause exists are generally not reviewable by this Court, where there is an allegation of grave abuse of discretion, the Ombudsman’s act cannot escape judicial scrutiny under the Court’s own constitutional power and duty “to determine whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.”

Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. The Ombudsman’s exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner — which must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law — in order to exceptionally warrant judicial intervention.[79] (Citations omitted)

Verily, the Court must now determine if public respondent rendered its rulings in gross contradiction to established law and jurisprudence.

In Tupaz v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas,[80] restated the elements of a violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft & Corrupt Practices Act: “(1) the offender is a public officer; (2) the act was done in the discharge of the public officer’s official, administrative or judicial functions; (3) the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (4) the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.”[81] From the facts as established in the proceedings below before public respondent, the Court finds both the third and fourth element severely lacking.

It is an established fact that private respondent indeed ordered the stoppage of payment of remittances due BFPMBAI due to the latter’s election controversy and resulting two sets of trustees. And on its face, private respondent’s authority to do so seems to be suspect. Even the President’s own power with regard to the same under Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 38 of Executive Order No. 292 (s. 1987), otherwise known as the Administrative Code of 1987, is statutorily circumscribed, viz:

SECTION 38. Suspension of Expenditure of Appropriations. – Except as otherwise provided in the General Appropriations Act and whenever in his judgment the public interest so requires, the President, upon notice to the head of office concerned, is authorized to suspend or otherwise stop further expenditure of funds allotted for any agency, or any other expenditure authorized in the General Appropriations Act, except for [personnel] services appropriations used for permanent officials and employees. (Underscoring supplied)

Given that remittances to associations such as BFP-MBAI are authorized deductions under any General Appropriations Act that are chargeable to appropriations for personnel services, private respondent seems to have lacked the proper authority to issue his Memorandum ordering the said stoppage. Moreover, relative to his filing of the Complaint-in-Interpleader, said case would have necessitated the consignation of the amounts corresponding to the remittances that should have been released to BFPMBAI, in accordance with Articles 1256[82] and 1258[83] of R.A. No. 386, otherwise known as the Civil Code of the Philippines. But Private Respondent really had no right of disposal over the said funds after they were reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. This is because Book VI, Chapter 4, Section 28[84] of the Administrative Code of 1987 requires subsequent legislative enactment for the expenditure of unexpended balances of appropriations that have been reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund—which is managed by the Bureau of the Treasury.

Despite the foregoing, the Court fails to see any manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence on the part of private respondent, as well as any undue injury or unwarranted benefits here. Private respondent may have been misguided or in ignorance of the finer points of the law regarding the appropriation and expenditure of public funds, but his actions belie his actual intent to protect the interests of both BFP and BFPMBAI. In ordering the stoppage of payment of the remittances, Private respondent was motivated by his assessment that the remittances would in all likelihood be the subject of mishandling due to the conflicting sets of trustees. This is also the motivation behind his filing of the Complaint-in-Interpleader, despite the seeming impossibility of consigning the remittance amounts. And to ensure that BFPMBAI members would not be unduly burdened, private respondent met with insurance providers such as Fortune Life in order to work out the uninterrupted processing of BFPMBAI members’ insurance claims during the pendency of the interpleader case.

It is true and obvious that private respondent belongs to the rival camp vis-à-vis Petitioners and their fellow complainants below, and one can easily surmise as to the camps’ likely animosity towards each other. Absent any concrete proof of private respondent’s manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence relative to his actions on the remittances, one cannot adduce anything that points to private respondent’s criminal intent. As the Court stated in Suba v. Sandiganbayan,[85] “[s]ince bad faith entails deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or to cause damage, it must be shown that the accused was spurred by corrupt motive.”[86] Elucidating further,

Jurisprudence instructs that bad faith referred to under Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence but of having a palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do some moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive, or ill will. It connotes a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. It is a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will and partakes of the nature of fraud.

In People v. Bacaltos, we explained that bad faith per se is not enough for one to be held criminally liable for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. Bad faith must be evident and must partake the nature of fraud. That is, it is a manifest[ly] deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or to cause damage.[87] (Citations omitted)

Moreover, there appears to be nothing in the record that crucially points to how petitioners, their fellow complainants below, BFPMBAI, or any of the latter’s members were subjected to any undue injury here. Petitioners’ bare allegations that BFPMBAI was put on the verge of financial collapse lack any substantial evidence, and assertion that BFPMBAI’s members were already entitled to the deductions to be remitted is belied by the very case they invoke: the Court in Tiro v. Hontanosas[88] specifically ruled that “[t]he salary check of a government officer or employee such as a teacher does not belong to him before it is physically delivered to him. Until that time the check belongs to the government. Accordingly, before there is actual delivery of the check, the payee has no power over it; he cannot assign it without the consent of the Government.”[89] Since BFP withheld the payment of the remittances—which actually never reached the Land Bank accounts of BFPMBAI members, contrary to what petitioners assert—the said amounts were not yet their personal property, and they were thus without any injury as yet.

Neither is there any showing here that private respondents accorded any unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference to any party, much less himself. As is clear from the facts, all the unremitted remittances reverted back to the control and disposition of the Bureau of the Treasury. Petitioners did not even allege that private respondent misappropriated or pilfered the said amounts. No disadvantage or preference is also present here, since there is an extant interpleader case that will determine in the first instance which set of BFPMBAI trustees will be entitled to administer and receive the remittances.

Going now to the second criminal charge, Lacap v. Sandiganbayan[90] restates the elements of a violation of Section 3(f) of R.A. No. 3019, viz: “(1) The offender is a public officer; (2) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him; (3) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; and (4) Such failure to so act is for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party, or discriminating against another.”[91] Again, the Court finds that there is no sufficient evidence on record to hold private respondent to account for such a charge.

From the facts, it is clear that the fourth element of the supposed crime is lacking. Petitioners and their fellow complainants below submitted bare allegations before public respondent that private respondent held the remittances “hostage” in return for either of the following: the ousting of the entire set of BFPMBAI trustees composed of petitioners and their fellow complainants, the recognition of Private Respondent as the legitimate chairperson of the BFPMBAI Board of Trustees, or even the issuance of BFPMBAI Board of Trustees’ Resolution No. 13-04 (which effectively gave private respondent and his camp a trustee seat). But these are just that: bare allegations unsubstantiated by any evidence of private respondent’s alleged actions that either compelled, intimidated, or blackmailed Petitioners and their fellow Complainants. Petitioners did not even present a transcript or record of the conversations they and their fellow complainants below had with private respondent immediately after the stoppage of payment. Again, and similar to the charge of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, there is no evidence on record pointing to any pecuniary or material benefit that private respondent received on account of his order to stop the payment of the remittances. Mere inferences and conjectures as to the one-upmanship between the two electoral camps will not suffice for purposes of finding probable cause here.

As to the charge against private respondent for violation of Article 286 of the RPC, Sy v. Secretary of Justice,[92] outlines the elements of the crime of Grave Coercion, viz.: “1) that a person is prevented by another from doing something not prohibited by law, or compelled to do something against his will, be it right or wrong; 2) that the prevention or compulsion is effected by violence, threats or intimidation; and 3) that the person who restrains the will and liberty of another has no right to do so, or in other words, that the restraint is not made under authority of law or in the exercise of any lawful right.”[93] Again, there is no evidence on record of any violence, threats, or intimidation on the part of private respondent save for their bare and unsubstantiated allegations. Even BFPMBAI Board of Trustees’ Resolution No. 13-04 has no extrinsic reference to any concrete action on the part of private respondent’s supposed demands for its issuance. Absent this, the criminal charge for grave coercion against private respondent—as outlined in the Complaint-Affidavit by mere imputation—breeds in the mind no probable cause for his indictment.

All in all, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondent due to the sheer absence of any evidence on record that would warrant a finding of probable cause to indict private respondent for the aforementioned criminal offenses. Petitioners carried the burden to prove that public respondent’s findings were tainted with capricious, whimsical, or even arbitrary jurisdictional error, but they failed to discharge said burden. As the Court ruled in Arroyo v. Sandiganbayan,[94] “[m]ere disagreement with the Ombudsman’s findings is not enough reason to constitute grave abuse of discretion. Petitioner must show that the preliminary investigation was conducted in such a way that amounted to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by law.”[95] With no exceptional showing of such alleged grave abuse of discretion here, the Court reverts to its policy of non-interference and respect vis-à-vis public respondent’s executive power to determine the existence of probable cause in preliminary investigations involving public officials. Thus, public respondent’s rulings relative to the dismissal of the criminal charges against private respondent must stand and remain unassailed.

On a penultimate note relative to private respondent’s Complaint-in-Interpleader, the Court refrains from passing any judgment thereon due to the pendency of proceedings before RTC-Quezon City (Branch 80)—the termination or finality of which has not been manifested before the Court. The Court, thus, cannot make a ruling as to whether or not private respondent was already barred from filing the same due to his supposed failure to question the election controversy through an intra-corporate controversy as insisted by petitioners. But said issue is actually irrelevant to the present petition, since the Court merely focuses on the intent behind private respondent’s filing of the said Complaint-in-Interpleader vis-à-vis the criminal aspect of the charges against him. As stated above, the Court finds that public respondent did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal aspect of the said charges, since its rulings do not deviate from standing law and jurisprudence.

Lastly, as to the matter of petitioners’ belated allegation that former Deputy Ombudsman Ramos had a hand in public respondent’s resolution of the Complaint-Affidavit, the Court takes a stern view against such an unsubstantiated charge. While it is of judicial notice that he was appointed to be Deputy Ombudsman on May 6, 2014, i.e., just over a month before public respondent promulgated its Joint Resolution, Deputy Ombudsman Ramos’ name appears nowhere in the record—save for in Petitioner’s Reply. He is not a signatory to both the Joint Resolution and Joint Order of Public Respondent vis-à-vis the case, and even if he was contracted as a financial consultant of BFP during the height of controversy (i.e., on September 2, 2013 as stated in his Service Agreement,[96] there is again no concrete proof on record of his alleged influence and bias that resulted in the dismissal of the Complaint-Affidavit (such as any official communications or papers signed or authored by former Deputy Ombudsman Ramos in his capacity as a BFP financial consultant). The Court sees fit to warn petitioners and their counsel against putting forth such unverified assertions in pleadings before any tribunal in the future.

WHEREFORE, the instant original Petition for Certiorari is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.

Inting, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.
Caguioa (Chairperson), J., see concurring opinion.","In their Complaint-Affidavit[4] filed before public respondent, petitioners along with nine other complainants[5] basically alleged the following:
1)
At the time of filing, they were officers and members of the Board of Trustees of the Bureau of Fire Protection Mutual Aid & Beneficiary Association, Inc. (BFPMBAI), with the exception of F/Dir. Asignado (BFPMBAI’s founder and chairman emeritus).[6]
          
2)
A Memorandum of Agreement[7] (MOA) was entered into between BFPMBAI and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) on March 6, 2006, whereby the latter undertook to periodically deduct from the respective payroll salaries of all BFP personnel with membership in the former, and to remit said deductions to the former as soon as practicable. Said MOA was signed by F/Dir. Asignado as BFP Chief and by private respondent as BFPMBAI President at the time.[8]
          
3)
Said deductions and remittances by the BFP had proceeded without any problems until the start of February 2013, when the BFPMBAI Board of Directors came to know of the non-remittance of deductions for the month of January 2013.[9] F/Dir. Collado, as BFPMBAI President at the time, sent a Letter[10] dated February 5, 2013 to private respondent (who was BFP Officer-in-Charge at the time) invoking the MOA for the immediate release of the said remittances.[11]
          
4)
On February 8, 2013, private respondent issued a Memorandum[12] to the BFP Cash Management Division Chief with the following tenor:
          
Pending legal resolution as to the legitimate sets of officers that would administer the affairs of the Bureau of Fire Protection Mutual Benefit Association (BFP MBAI), the deduction from the Continuous Form Checks (CFCs) for salaries and allowances of BFP personnel nation-wide is hereby temporarily stopped effective February 2013.
 
          
The amounts deducted for BFP MBAI Contribution and BFP MBAI Salary Loan under deduction codes D116 and A117, respectively from the January 2013 CFCs should be refunded immediately.
 
          
The MBAI deductions shall resume only when a notice or memorandum for its resumption is served.
 
          
For strict compliance.[13]
          
5)
Said legal controversy has its origins in the 6th BFPMBAI General Membership Meeting held on June 30, 2012, which was also the forum for the election of the nine members of the BFPMBAI Board of Trustees.[14] According to the undated Report[15] of the BFPMBAI Committee on Elections (BFPBMAI COMELEC), only 167 voters were present, but the votes of 2,840 absent members were cast by the presiding officer (i.e., Fire Chief Superintendent F/CSupt. Danilo R. Cabrera, a supposed ally of private respondent vis-à-vis the said elections) in favor of private respondent and other candidates allied with the latter. BFPMBAI COMELEC did not proclaim any winners, and duly ruled that the election was to have a “status quo ante order” in light of queries likely to be filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).[16] Petitioners and their fellow complainants still assumed and administered the affairs of BFPMBAI despite the actions coming from the camp of private respondent, since they viewed the additional votes and new tally as without basis.[17]
          
6)
F/Dir. Collado sent another Letter[18] dated February 20, 2013, this time to the BFP Cash Management Division Chief, in order to inquire into the BFP’s refusal of remitting the deductions due to BFPMBAI.[19] With no reply to either of Petitioner Collado’s Letters, due efforts were subsequently made to communicate with private respondent in person. Petitioners and their fellow complainants thus alleged that “[i]n all the meetings attended by the [private] respondent, he expressly and categorically declared that he will release the remittance due for the association on the condition that he will be the one to sit as its chairman and all the voted-out trustees shall assume, though illegal[ly], as members of the board.”[20]
          
7)
Additionally, on March 8, 2013, petitioners and their fellow complainants (acting as BFPMBAI’s Board of Trustees) issued BFPMBAI Board of Trustees’ Resolution No. 13-04,[21] which accepted the sudden resignation of F/CSupt. Ruben F. Bearis (Bearis) as Vice Chairman for Administration and Trustee (submitted for personal reasons) and electing private respondent as F/CSupt. Bearis’ replacement. Said Resolution was allegedly issued to accommodate private respondent, whose “continuing intimidation, compulsion, and insistence” had “compelled” petitioners and their fellow complainants to sign the supposedly unlawful Resolution.[22] Private respondent also allegedly continued to work towards the reinstatement of his fellow Trustees that were not re-elected during the June 30, 2012 election, but to no avail due to the resistance of petitioners and their fellow complainants.[23]
          
8)
As of March 27, 2013, the accumulated deductions due for remittance to BFPMBAI had amounted to P18,595,384.23, and thus, by reason of private respondent’s “malicious and intentional acts, x x x lending operations and payment of insurance premiums for the members were suspended for absence of funds. The supposed profits from the withheld remittances remained unrealized as these funds were never distributed in the form of loans to its members. Payment of interests in favor of creditors were likewise suspended, hence, the association incurred additional liabilities or burden in the form of surcharges and penalties.”[24]

Thus, “[f]or exhibiting malice and evident bad faith in withholding the release, after due demands or requests, of remittance that caused grave damage, prejudice, and injury to the association,”[25] petitioners and their fellow complainants alleged that private respondent violated Sections 3(e)[26] and 3(f)[27] of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft & Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Article 286[28] of Act No. 3815, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for “maliciously compelling the incumbent trustees against their will, through threats or intimidation of withholding the release of remittance, to execute a resolution authorizing the assumption into office of the respondent and all the voted-out trustees during the General Assembly.”[29] Petitioners and their fellow complainants also prayed that private respondent be correspondingly disciplined for the administrative offenses of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, oppression, and grave abuse of authority.[30]
For his part, private respondent stated in his Counter-Affidavit[31] the following:
1)
He was indeed designated as BFP’s Officer-in-Charge on January 11, 2013, and upon his assumption of duties, he learned that petitioners and their fellow Complainants had taken over the management of BFPMBAI despite the BFPMBAI COMELEC’s “status quo ante order.”[32] He had also previously received a Letter-Reply[33] dated October 19, 2012 from the SEC vis-à-vis his request for legal opinion regarding the BFPMBAI election controversy, wherein the SEC refrained from rendering said legal opinion due to its possible effect on the substantive rights of parties in a potential controversy before a court of competent jurisdiction, but gave guidance by pointing out that a majority of the bona fide members of BFPMBAI were not present during the election and general members’ meeting.[34]
          
2)
On March 14, 2013, in his capacity as BFP Officer-in-Charge, he met with representatives from Fortune Life Insurance Co., Inc. Said meeting resulted in an agreement-in-principle between BFP and the said insurance company for the former’s release to the latter of the insurance premium payments of BFPMBAI members in anticipation of the case to be filed by private respondent relative to the BFPMBAI election controversy.[35] Said agreement-in-principle is evidenced by the Minutes of Meeting[36] attached to private respondent’s Counter-Affidavit.
          
3)
On March 21, 2013, private respondent indeed filed a Complaint-in-Interpleader,[37] which was raffled off to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (Branch 80) and docketed as Civil Case No. Q-13-72923. Said Complaint-in-Interpleader was directed against the two competing groups both claiming to be the legitimate BFPMBAI Board of Trustees, and prayed for the “deposit of the outstanding remittances of the monthly dues collected so far from [BFPMBAI] members, representing remittances [for] the months of January and February and March 2013 to [the] Court, and considering the release thereof to whomever of defendants is entitled to the same.”[38]
          
Incidentally, and at the time of private respondent’s filing of his Counter-Affidavit, RTC-Quezon City (Branch 80) had issued on July 15, 2013 an Order[39] issuing a Writ of Preliminary injunction against petitioners and their fellow complainants in order to restrain them from conducting business as BFPMBAI’s Board of Trustees during the pendency of the case (unless otherwise authorized, and conditioned upon the posting of a bond of P10,000,000.00 by the group of officers and trustees allied with private respondent).[40]
          
4)
Addressing the Complaint-Affidavit’s allegation of violating R.A. No. 3019 and of committing the corresponding multiple administrative offenses, Private respondent puts forth the following affirmative defense:
          
5. In issuing the Memorandum for the temporary stoppage of the remittance of BFPMBAI contributions, I did not employ intimidation nor was the same done without legal basis or justified cause. It bears to stress out [sic] that the herein complainants took over the management of the BFPMBAI in blatant disregard of the COMELEC’s Status Quo Ante Order. Needless to say, the same is unlawful, unauthorized and without any legal color. Instead of succumbing to complainant’s baseless threats and prodding, I opted to exercise prudent management in order to protect the rights and interests of the association and its members. A careful perusal of the Memorandum would show that the same was resorted to pending legal resolution as to the legitimate sets of officers that would administer the affairs of the BFPMBAI. I should not be blamed for doing that because the complainants themselves admitted in their complaint that they “assumed and administered the affairs of the association” since July 2012 (paragraph 16 of the Complaint). Corollary to their assumption is the fact that they have been disbursing funds albeit their illegal assumption. It would be an irresponsible act, on the other hand, to just release the funds in the middle of a legal controversy. Suffice it to say, the Memorandum I issued was done without malice but well within the exercise of a lawful right.
 
          
6. Moreover, the funds representing the monthly contributions were not squandered as the same were reverted to the Bureau of [the] Treasury and may be withdrawn any time after the issue brought before the RTC has been settled. Copy of the Certification[41] is hereto attached as Annex “F.”[42] (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)
 
          
5)
As to the Complaint-Affidavit’s accusation of grave coercion, private respondent denies that he ever committed any actions amounting to the same, viz.:
          
7. Furthermore, complainants’ allegation that I withheld the release of the remittance[s] in order to force the complainants to authorize the assumption into office of the other group is a brazen lie. Such averment is not only a product of their polluted mind but runs counter to the attending circumstances. Clear is the ground that the remittances were held in abeyance pending resolution of the conflicting claims of the two contending parties.
 
          
8. Neither is complainants’ allegation true with respect to their statement that I insisted, intimidated and compelled the Board of Trustees to sign a resolution declaring me as a trustee vice F/CSupt. Ruben F. Bearis. Firstly, I did not even insinuate, much more [sic] compel, intimidate or insist to be declared trustee together with the complainants. It is highly improbable considering the fact that there is a pending legal question as to who [sic] or which group is the legitimate officers of the BFPMBAI. Secondly, the issuance of the alleged resolution should not be attributed to me because I have no personal knowledge as to what transpires in their circle. The supposed Resolution No. 13-04 was issued without my knowledge and thirdly, the said resolution is self-serving. Worthy to note also is the fact that the alleged Resolution was issued on 08 March 2013, after our 05 March 2013 meeting when we came up with a solution to address the association’s problem. Clearly, it was the complainants who had a change of heart and eventually reneged on their commitment to honor the Status Quo Ante Order issued by the COMELEC. For all we know, the issued resolution was resorted to by the herein complainants to implicate me some way or another, as they have done in the instant case.[43]
 
6)
Overall, private respondent sought public respondent’s dismissal of all the charges filed against him—both criminal and administrative.[44]

Petitioners (who are only three of the original complainants) put forth the following submissions in support of their theory that public respondent erred in dismissing all charges against private respondent:

1)
In reiteration of their first argument before public respondent in their Motion for Reconsideration below, petitioners assert that private respondent never questioned the election of their camp as the rightful and legitimate Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI with the proper intra-corporate controversy before the appropriate RTC, and thus, their supposed election could no longer be questioned. Hence, private respondent had no legal grounds to order the stoppage of payments vis-à-vis the remittances due BFPMBAI. Moreover, any doubt as to their legitimacy as the rightful Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI was irrelevant given the separate and distinct legal personality of BFPMBAI from its Board of Trustees. Petitioners thus mean that the remittances would go to BFPMBAI as an institution, and not just into the hands of its Board of Trustees.[60]
2)
In relation to the aforementioned, private respondent thus, could no longer validly file the Complaint-in-Interpleader now under the jurisdiction of RTC-Quezon City (Branch 80). Said case could not be a substitute for the intra-corporate controversy/election contest that private respondent should have filed. Moreover, petitioners reiterate private respondent’s supposed admission and recognition of their authority as the Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI through his loan application from the association in 2012.[61]
3)
Relative to the legal nature of the remittances due BFPMBAI, petitioners again raise their theory that the same is already private property rightfully pertaining to BFPMBAI members once they have been placed at their disposal, i.e., deposited into their automated teller machine accounts with Land Bank of the Philippines. Thus, private respondent had no legal ground to stop their payment as agreed under the MOA between BFP and BFPMBAI.[62]
In his Comment,[63] private respondent counter-asserts that public respondent committed neither any reversible error nor any grave abuse of discretion when it rendered its rulings dismissing both the criminal and administrative charges against him. Private Respondent also points out the crucial fact that the BFPMBAI COMELEC never proclaimed any winners relative to the elections held on June 30, 2012, and instead of certifying any winner thereto, said committee issued its “status quo ante order.” Due to this unresolved electoral controversy, and the resulting separate sets of BFPMBAI officers and trustees, private respondent was compelled to act accordingly by ordering the stoppage of remittances and filing the Complaint-in-Interpleader. Due to his recognition of the jurisdiction of the appropriate court over the legal question of which set of officers and/or trustees would rightly be entitled to administer BFPMBAI’s finances and receive the remittances, private respondent insists that he was acting on behalf of the interests of both BFP (as its Officer-in-Charge) and BFPMBAI (as a member). Moreover, there was no showing of any ill will on his part relative to the stoppage of payment of the said remittances. He prays that the instant petition should thus accordingly be dismissed.[64]

In its Manifestation and Motion[65] filed by the Office of the Solicitor General, public respondent respectfully submits that it need not participate further in the proceedings of instant Petition pursuant to Rule 65, Section 5[66] of the 1997 Rules of Court. Since Public Respondent is merely a nominal party, it should be excused from being required to file a comment. The Court noted and granted public respondent’s request via its Resolution[67] dated August 1, 2018.

In their Reply,[68] Petitioners reiterate their stance that public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion when it rendered its rulings dismissing all charges against private respondent—despite the “presence of overwhelming evidence”[69] against the latter. They add to their submission their recent discovery of the supposed influence, partiality, personal bias, and strong connections of former Deputy Ombudsman for the Military & Other Law Enforcement Offices Cyril E. Ramos (Deputy Ombudsman Ramos) relative to the case,[70] viz.:

9. True to their words and to our surprise, we discovered that the incumbent Deputy Ombudsman for the MOLEO in the person of ATTY. CYRIL E. RAMOS, was a former financial consultant of respondent Romero during the time when the latter was the Officer-in-Charge of the BFP. It may be well to emphasize that the administrative and criminal charges subject of this petition were filed before the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the MOLEO. In this case[,] where personal connection and influence exists between private respondent Romero and Deputy Ombudsman Ramos, herein petitioners were not surprised why it favoured respondent Romero despite the presence of overwhelming evidence against him. Copy of the SERVICE AGREEMENT[71] between respondent Romero and ATTY. CYRIL E. RAMOS dated 02 September 2013 is hereto attached and marked as ANNEX L;[72]

In effect, petitioners offer no new arguments aside from the alleged bias and supposedly inappropriate connection between former Deputy Ombudsman Ramos and Private Respondent during the pendency of proceedings before Public Respondent.",The sole issue for the Court’s consideration here is whether or not public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing both the criminal and administrative charges filed against private respondent.,"After further consideration of the Position Papers of both petitioners (and their fellow complainants)[45] and private respondent,[46] public respondent promulgated its Joint Resolution[47] dated June 20, 2014 with the following dispositive portion:

WHEREFORE, both the criminal and administrative charges against F/CSUPT. CARLITO S. ROMERO are DISMISSED.

SO ORDERED.[48]

Public respondent gave the following reasons:

The Election Rules and Regulations of the BFPMBAI states [sic] that the “winning candidates, their election being final and immediately executory after due certification by the Committee on Elections, will be announced and will be inducted into office immediately by the Comelec Chairman.” Here, there was no certification and induction of the winning candidates because a status quo ante order was issued by the COMELEC taking note that only 167 out of 3,007 members attended the General Assembly coupled with the issue on [sic] whether the Presiding Officer could cast the votes of the 2,840 absent members. Such being the case, it was then apparent that a legal controversy indeed existed as to who should be recognized as the legitimate Board of Trustees of the Association. Corollary thereto, is the issue of who should be entitled to receive the remittances from the BFP. Given this scenario, respondent was justified in withholding the release of remittances and instead filing a case for Interpleader because it is one of the remedies provided under the law. It only shows that he recognized the jurisdiction of the courts in settling the dispute between the contending officers, which issue was beyond his power to decide. As the Officer-in-Charge of the BFP and as a member of BFPMBAI, respondent was duty-bound to protect the interest of the members and ensure that the remittances will go to the proper parties. Taking into account that the complaint in Interpleader, together with the main case filed by the contending sets of Trustees, are now pending trial before Branch 80, Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, any issue arising therefrom especially on the propriety of releasing the remittances is already covered by the sub judice rule.

Moreover, complainants failed to satisfactorily show that respondent was motivated by ill will in withholding the remittances since he did not benefit from the money withheld by the BFP. In fact, as certified by the BFP Chief Accountant, Gina H. Gonzales, the cash allocation intended for the monthly remittances of BFPMBAI Contribution and Salary Loan Deductions from January to June 2013 were reverted to the Bureau of [the] Treasury.[49]

Petitioners and their fellow complainants duly filed their Motion for Reconsideration[50] relative to the aforementioned dismissal, which had three main arguments:
1)
Private respondent’s proper recourse vis-à-vis the BFPMBAI election was actually an intra-corporate controversy cognizable before the appropriate RTC. Since no intra-corporate controversy was filed by private respondent or anyone from his camp within 15 days from the election on June 30, 2012 (in accordance with Rule 6, Section 3[51] of A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC [dated 13 March 2001], otherwise known as the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies), petitioners and their fellow complainants assert that they are the legitimate Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI, and thus, private respondent had no valid ground to withhold the remittances. Moreover, even if there was doubt as to their legitimacy as the rightful Board of Trustees of BFPMBAI, the association itself has a legal personality separate and distinct from its governing board.[52]
          
2)
Private respondent had previously secured a loan from BFPMBAI while it was being managed by petitioners and their fellow complainants, as evidenced by private respondent’s Loan Application Form[53] dated August 3, 2012 for the amount of P250,000.00 (and approved on behalf of the BFPMBAI Board of Trustees by F/Dir. Collado). Petitioners and their fellow complainants thus, essentially argued, that this was an admission against private respondent’s own interest.[54]
          
3)
The remittances due BFPMBAI are actually already property of BFPMBAI members, which could no longer be withheld and reverted back to the Bureau of the Treasury by BFP. Private respondent thus, had no legal grounds for his actions in stopping their payment.[55]
In its Joint Order[56] dated December 21, 2015, public respondent denied the said Motion for Reconsideration, viz.:
WHEREFORE, complainants’ Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. Accordingly, the Joint Resolution dated June 20, 2014 STANDS.

SO ORDERED.[57]

Public respondent reasoned that private respondent’s filing of the Complaint-in-Interpleader was appropriate considering the circumstances, and that its ultimate goal was “not intended to challenge a Board member’s claim to an elective office, but rather to ascertain which set of BFPMBAI Board of Trustees was legitimately entitled to receive the payroll deductions of its members.”[58] Aggrieved, Petitioners went on direct recourse to this Court via the instant original Petition for Certiorari.[59]

The Court rules in the negative, and accordingly, the instant petition must be dismissed for lack of merit.

At the outset, the Court first must note that public respondent’s dismissal of the administrative charges against private respondent vis-à-vis Case No. OMB-P-A-13-0310 has already attained finality. This is because petitioners cannot seek direct recourse from the Court relative to public respondent’s said dismissal, which is only applicable to the criminal aspect of public respondent’s rulings. The Court had already clarified in Joson v. Office of the Ombudsman[73] that the proper remedy to assail the complete exoneration or absolution of a respondent in an administrative case decided by the Ombudsman is to file an original petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals.[74] Thus, the Court lacks jurisdiction to touch upon the administrative aspect of public respondent’s rulings here.

With regard to the criminal aspect of public respondent’s rulings vis-à-vis Case No. OMB-P-C-13-0269, the Court is reminded of its fairly recent ruling in Yatco v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon,[75] which reiterated the jurisprudential lineage summed up in Gatchalian v. Office of the Ombudsman[76] relative to the Court’s own and proper jurisdiction over original petitions for certiorari to assail the Ombudsman’s rulings in criminal cases involving findings of probable cause (or lack thereof). The Court also clarified in the remedies available to a party wishing to question a consolidated ruling of the Ombudsman (i.e., which disposed of both criminal and administrative aspects of a case), viz.:

As consolidation is a matter for the court to determine post-filing, it does not affect the nature of the procedural recourse taken by the aggrieved party. Here, when the Ombudsman consolidated the criminal and administrative charges against respondents, it deemed it proper to resolve both criminal and administrative aspects in one Joint Resolution because the charges involved common questions of fact or law. Ordinarily, administrative and criminal charges filed before the Ombudsman would usually pertain to one incident involving the same set of facts and parties, from which both criminal and administrative liabilities may stem. This gives rise to their consolidation. However, after the Ombudsman renders its consolidated ruling, the aggrieved party is then required to take the appropriate procedural remedies to separately assail the administrative and criminal components of the same. Clearly, a Rule 65 certiorari petition (which is the proper remedy to assail the criminal aspect of the Ombudsman ruling; or the administrative aspect of an unappealable Ombudsman ruling) is clearly different from a Rule 43 appeal (which is the proper remedy to assail the administrative aspect of an appealable ruling).[77]

Thus, the Court only has jurisdiction over the instant Petition vis-à-vis its criminal aspect. In other words, the Court now presently considers the sole issue proper, i.e., whether or not Public Respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in finding no probable cause to charge private respondent for violation of Sections 3(e) and 3(f) of R.A. No. 3019, as well as Article 286 of the RPC.

The Court’s jurisdiction to review and check any grave abuse of discretion relative to the prosecutorial powers of the Ombudsman is circumscribed by jurisprudential precedent that affirms constitutional and legislative fiat. In Casing v. Ombudsman,[78] the Court expounded thus:

The Constitution and R.A. No. 6770 endowed the Office of the Ombudsman with wide latitude, in the exercise of its investigatory and prosecutory powers, to pass upon criminal complaints involving public officials and employees. Specifically, the determination of whether probable cause exists is a function that belongs to the Office of the Ombudsman. Whether a criminal case, given its attendant facts and circumstances, should be filed or not is basically its call.

As a general rule, the Court does not interfere with the Office of the Ombudsman’s exercise of its investigative and prosecutorial powers, and respects the initiative and independence inherent in the Office of the Ombudsman which, “beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of the public service.” While the Ombudsman’s findings as to whether probable cause exists are generally not reviewable by this Court, where there is an allegation of grave abuse of discretion, the Ombudsman’s act cannot escape judicial scrutiny under the Court’s own constitutional power and duty “to determine whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.”

Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. The Ombudsman’s exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner — which must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law — in order to exceptionally warrant judicial intervention.[79] (Citations omitted)

Verily, the Court must now determine if public respondent rendered its rulings in gross contradiction to established law and jurisprudence.

In Tupaz v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas,[80] restated the elements of a violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft & Corrupt Practices Act: “(1) the offender is a public officer; (2) the act was done in the discharge of the public officer’s official, administrative or judicial functions; (3) the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (4) the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.”[81] From the facts as established in the proceedings below before public respondent, the Court finds both the third and fourth element severely lacking.

It is an established fact that private respondent indeed ordered the stoppage of payment of remittances due BFPMBAI due to the latter’s election controversy and resulting two sets of trustees. And on its face, private respondent’s authority to do so seems to be suspect. Even the President’s own power with regard to the same under Book VI, Chapter 5, Section 38 of Executive Order No. 292 (s. 1987), otherwise known as the Administrative Code of 1987, is statutorily circumscribed, viz:

SECTION 38. Suspension of Expenditure of Appropriations. – Except as otherwise provided in the General Appropriations Act and whenever in his judgment the public interest so requires, the President, upon notice to the head of office concerned, is authorized to suspend or otherwise stop further expenditure of funds allotted for any agency, or any other expenditure authorized in the General Appropriations Act, except for [personnel] services appropriations used for permanent officials and employees. (Underscoring supplied)

Given that remittances to associations such as BFP-MBAI are authorized deductions under any General Appropriations Act that are chargeable to appropriations for personnel services, private respondent seems to have lacked the proper authority to issue his Memorandum ordering the said stoppage. Moreover, relative to his filing of the Complaint-in-Interpleader, said case would have necessitated the consignation of the amounts corresponding to the remittances that should have been released to BFPMBAI, in accordance with Articles 1256[82] and 1258[83] of R.A. No. 386, otherwise known as the Civil Code of the Philippines. But Private Respondent really had no right of disposal over the said funds after they were reverted to the Bureau of the Treasury. This is because Book VI, Chapter 4, Section 28[84] of the Administrative Code of 1987 requires subsequent legislative enactment for the expenditure of unexpended balances of appropriations that have been reverted to the unappropriated surplus of the General Fund—which is managed by the Bureau of the Treasury.

Despite the foregoing, the Court fails to see any manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence on the part of private respondent, as well as any undue injury or unwarranted benefits here. Private respondent may have been misguided or in ignorance of the finer points of the law regarding the appropriation and expenditure of public funds, but his actions belie his actual intent to protect the interests of both BFP and BFPMBAI. In ordering the stoppage of payment of the remittances, Private respondent was motivated by his assessment that the remittances would in all likelihood be the subject of mishandling due to the conflicting sets of trustees. This is also the motivation behind his filing of the Complaint-in-Interpleader, despite the seeming impossibility of consigning the remittance amounts. And to ensure that BFPMBAI members would not be unduly burdened, private respondent met with insurance providers such as Fortune Life in order to work out the uninterrupted processing of BFPMBAI members’ insurance claims during the pendency of the interpleader case.

It is true and obvious that private respondent belongs to the rival camp vis-à-vis Petitioners and their fellow complainants below, and one can easily surmise as to the camps’ likely animosity towards each other. Absent any concrete proof of private respondent’s manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence relative to his actions on the remittances, one cannot adduce anything that points to private respondent’s criminal intent. As the Court stated in Suba v. Sandiganbayan,[85] “[s]ince bad faith entails deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or to cause damage, it must be shown that the accused was spurred by corrupt motive.”[86] Elucidating further,

Jurisprudence instructs that bad faith referred to under Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019 does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence but of having a palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do some moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive, or ill will. It connotes a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. It is a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will and partakes of the nature of fraud.

In People v. Bacaltos, we explained that bad faith per se is not enough for one to be held criminally liable for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. Bad faith must be evident and must partake the nature of fraud. That is, it is a manifest[ly] deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or to cause damage.[87] (Citations omitted)

Moreover, there appears to be nothing in the record that crucially points to how petitioners, their fellow complainants below, BFPMBAI, or any of the latter’s members were subjected to any undue injury here. Petitioners’ bare allegations that BFPMBAI was put on the verge of financial collapse lack any substantial evidence, and assertion that BFPMBAI’s members were already entitled to the deductions to be remitted is belied by the very case they invoke: the Court in Tiro v. Hontanosas[88] specifically ruled that “[t]he salary check of a government officer or employee such as a teacher does not belong to him before it is physically delivered to him. Until that time the check belongs to the government. Accordingly, before there is actual delivery of the check, the payee has no power over it; he cannot assign it without the consent of the Government.”[89] Since BFP withheld the payment of the remittances—which actually never reached the Land Bank accounts of BFPMBAI members, contrary to what petitioners assert—the said amounts were not yet their personal property, and they were thus without any injury as yet.

Neither is there any showing here that private respondents accorded any unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference to any party, much less himself. As is clear from the facts, all the unremitted remittances reverted back to the control and disposition of the Bureau of the Treasury. Petitioners did not even allege that private respondent misappropriated or pilfered the said amounts. No disadvantage or preference is also present here, since there is an extant interpleader case that will determine in the first instance which set of BFPMBAI trustees will be entitled to administer and receive the remittances.

Going now to the second criminal charge, Lacap v. Sandiganbayan[90] restates the elements of a violation of Section 3(f) of R.A. No. 3019, viz: “(1) The offender is a public officer; (2) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him; (3) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; and (4) Such failure to so act is for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party, or discriminating against another.”[91] Again, the Court finds that there is no sufficient evidence on record to hold private respondent to account for such a charge.

From the facts, it is clear that the fourth element of the supposed crime is lacking. Petitioners and their fellow complainants below submitted bare allegations before public respondent that private respondent held the remittances “hostage” in return for either of the following: the ousting of the entire set of BFPMBAI trustees composed of petitioners and their fellow complainants, the recognition of Private Respondent as the legitimate chairperson of the BFPMBAI Board of Trustees, or even the issuance of BFPMBAI Board of Trustees’ Resolution No. 13-04 (which effectively gave private respondent and his camp a trustee seat). But these are just that: bare allegations unsubstantiated by any evidence of private respondent’s alleged actions that either compelled, intimidated, or blackmailed Petitioners and their fellow Complainants. Petitioners did not even present a transcript or record of the conversations they and their fellow complainants below had with private respondent immediately after the stoppage of payment. Again, and similar to the charge of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, there is no evidence on record pointing to any pecuniary or material benefit that private respondent received on account of his order to stop the payment of the remittances. Mere inferences and conjectures as to the one-upmanship between the two electoral camps will not suffice for purposes of finding probable cause here.

As to the charge against private respondent for violation of Article 286 of the RPC, Sy v. Secretary of Justice,[92] outlines the elements of the crime of Grave Coercion, viz.: “1) that a person is prevented by another from doing something not prohibited by law, or compelled to do something against his will, be it right or wrong; 2) that the prevention or compulsion is effected by violence, threats or intimidation; and 3) that the person who restrains the will and liberty of another has no right to do so, or in other words, that the restraint is not made under authority of law or in the exercise of any lawful right.”[93] Again, there is no evidence on record of any violence, threats, or intimidation on the part of private respondent save for their bare and unsubstantiated allegations. Even BFPMBAI Board of Trustees’ Resolution No. 13-04 has no extrinsic reference to any concrete action on the part of private respondent’s supposed demands for its issuance. Absent this, the criminal charge for grave coercion against private respondent—as outlined in the Complaint-Affidavit by mere imputation—breeds in the mind no probable cause for his indictment.

All in all, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondent due to the sheer absence of any evidence on record that would warrant a finding of probable cause to indict private respondent for the aforementioned criminal offenses. Petitioners carried the burden to prove that public respondent’s findings were tainted with capricious, whimsical, or even arbitrary jurisdictional error, but they failed to discharge said burden. As the Court ruled in Arroyo v. Sandiganbayan,[94] “[m]ere disagreement with the Ombudsman’s findings is not enough reason to constitute grave abuse of discretion. Petitioner must show that the preliminary investigation was conducted in such a way that amounted to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by law.”[95] With no exceptional showing of such alleged grave abuse of discretion here, the Court reverts to its policy of non-interference and respect vis-à-vis public respondent’s executive power to determine the existence of probable cause in preliminary investigations involving public officials. Thus, public respondent’s rulings relative to the dismissal of the criminal charges against private respondent must stand and remain unassailed.

On a penultimate note relative to private respondent’s Complaint-in-Interpleader, the Court refrains from passing any judgment thereon due to the pendency of proceedings before RTC-Quezon City (Branch 80)—the termination or finality of which has not been manifested before the Court. The Court, thus, cannot make a ruling as to whether or not private respondent was already barred from filing the same due to his supposed failure to question the election controversy through an intra-corporate controversy as insisted by petitioners. But said issue is actually irrelevant to the present petition, since the Court merely focuses on the intent behind private respondent’s filing of the said Complaint-in-Interpleader vis-à-vis the criminal aspect of the charges against him. As stated above, the Court finds that public respondent did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal aspect of the said charges, since its rulings do not deviate from standing law and jurisprudence.

Lastly, as to the matter of petitioners’ belated allegation that former Deputy Ombudsman Ramos had a hand in public respondent’s resolution of the Complaint-Affidavit, the Court takes a stern view against such an unsubstantiated charge. While it is of judicial notice that he was appointed to be Deputy Ombudsman on May 6, 2014, i.e., just over a month before public respondent promulgated its Joint Resolution, Deputy Ombudsman Ramos’ name appears nowhere in the record—save for in Petitioner’s Reply. He is not a signatory to both the Joint Resolution and Joint Order of Public Respondent vis-à-vis the case, and even if he was contracted as a financial consultant of BFP during the height of controversy (i.e., on September 2, 2013 as stated in his Service Agreement,[96] there is again no concrete proof on record of his alleged influence and bias that resulted in the dismissal of the Complaint-Affidavit (such as any official communications or papers signed or authored by former Deputy Ombudsman Ramos in his capacity as a BFP financial consultant). The Court sees fit to warn petitioners and their counsel against putting forth such unverified assertions in pleadings before any tribunal in the future.

WHEREFORE, the instant original Petition for Certiorari is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.

ARMILYN MORILLO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND
RICHARD NATIVIDAD, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N
PERALTA, J.:
Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court
seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[1] dated January 18, 2011 and Resolution[2]
dated August 9, 2011 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 32723 which reversed
and set aside the Decision[3] dated February 23, 2009 and Order[4] dated July 13, 2009, of the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 08-1876-77, which, in turn, affirmed the
Joint Decision[5] dated September 3, 2008 of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) in Criminal
Case Nos. 337902-03.
The antecedent facts are as follows:
Sometime in July 2003, respondent Richard Natividad, Milo Malong and Bing Nanquil,
introducing themselves as contractors doing business in Pampanga City under the name and
style of RB Custodio Construction, purchased construction materials for their project inside
the Subic Freeport Zone from petitioner Armilyn Morillo, owner of Amasea General
Merchandize and Construction Supplies. The parties agreed that twenty percent (20%) of
the purchases shall be paid within seven (7) days after the first delivery and the remaining
eighty percent (80%) to be paid within thirty-five (35) days after the last delivery, all of
which shall be via postdated checks.[6]
Pursuant to the agreement, petitioner delivered construction materials amounting to a total
of P500,054.00 at the construction site where respondent and his partners were
undertaking their project. After the last delivery, respondent paid P20,000.00 in cash and
issued two (2) post-dated checks, drawn from Metrobank, Pampanga branch, in the amounts
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015 of P393,000.00 and P87,054.00. Upon maturity, petitioner attempted to deposit the checks
in her savings account at Equitable PCI Bank, San Lorenzo, Makati City. They were,
however, dishonored by the drawee bank. Immediately thereafter, petitioner communicated
the dishonor to respondent and his partners and demanded for payment. Again, respondent
issued two (2) post-dated Metrobank checks and assured petitioner that they will be
honored upon maturity. Upon deposit in her savings account at Equitable PCI Bank, Makati
Branch, the checks were once again dishonored for the reason that the account from which
they were drawn was already a closed account. Consequently, petitioner made several
demands from respondent and his partners, but to no avail, prompting her to file a
complaint with the City Prosecution Office, Makati City.[7] Thus, on August 12, 2004, two (2)
Informations were filed against respondent and Milo Malong, the accusatory portions of
which read:

CONTRARY TO LAW.[8]
On September 15, 2004, the Assistant City Prosecutor issued a Resolution recommending
that respondent and his partners be charged in court with the crime of Estafa under Article
315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code as well as for Violation of Batas Pambansa
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
No. 22 (BP 22), which was later docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 337902-03.
On September 3, 2008, the MeTC rendered its Joint Decision, finding that the prosecution
had proven all the elements of violation of BP 22 as against respondent, the dispositive
portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in Criminal Cases Nos. 337902-03 finding
the accused, RICHARD NATIVIDAD, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the
offense of Violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 and is sentenced to pay a fine
equivalent to Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php200,000.00), for Check No.
2960203217 and Thirteen Thousand Thirty-Two Pesos for Check No. 2960203218
or a total penalty of Two Hundred Thousand Thirteen Thousand Thirty Two Pesos
(Php213,032.00), with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. However,
accused MILO MALONG, is ACQUITTED on the ground of reasonable doubt. Both
accused Malong and Natividad are ordered to jointly pay the private complainant
the total sum of Four Hundred Forty-Seven Thousand Four Hundred Sixty-Two
Pesos (Php447,462.00) which are the face value of the two (2) checks issued,
subject of these cases, with interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum and
three percent (3%) penalty per month as stipulated in the invoices, reckoned
from the date of receipt of the demand on February 28, 2004, until the amount is
fully paid, plus the costs of suit.
All other claims are DISMISSED for lack of evidence.
SO ORDERED.[9]
Respondent appealed the decision of the MeTC to the RTC arguing that the MeTC of Makati
City had no jurisdiction over the case. He asserted that since the subject checks were
issued, drawn, and delivered to petitioner in Subic, the venue of the action was improperly
laid for none of the elements of the offense actually transpired in Makati City. Respondent
also pointed out that during the retaking of petitioner’s testimony on March 14, 2008, the
records of the case did not show that the public prosecutor manifested his presence in court
and that he delegated the prosecution of the case to the private prosecutor. Thus, since
there was no appearance for the public prosecutor, nor was there a proper delegation of
authority, the proceedings should be declared null and void.[10]
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
On February 23, 2009, the RTC affirmed the MeTC ruling in the following wise:
Since accused Natividad failed to raise before the court [a quo] the issue of
authority of the private prosecutor to present witness Morillo in the absence of
the public prosecutor during the March 14, 2008 proceeding, and only did so
after obtaining an adverse judgment, it would be an injustice if all the
proceedings had in the case would be set aside.
The second issue raised on appeal also holds no ground. A violation of BP 22 is a
continuing or transitory offense, which is oft-repeated in our jurisprudence.
Under this doctrine, jurisdiction may be had in several places where one of the
acts material to the crime occurred.
Accused Natividad postulates that since the checks were presented and
dishonored in Makati City, which is not the place where it was issued and
delivered, the court [a quo] lacks jurisdiction. This argument is, at best,
specious. The fact remains that the bank where it was presented for
payment is in Makati City. These checks passed through this bank for
clearance, confirmation, and or validation processes. Moreover, the
eventual dishonour indeed took place or was completed at the end of the
collecting bank in Makati City, where the private complainant maintains
her account over which the court [a quo] has jurisdiction.
WHEREFORE, finding no merit on accused-appellant Natividad’s appeal, the
same is hereby dismissed. Accordingly, the appealed decision of the court [a quo]
is hereby AFFIRMED in full.
SO ORDERED.[11]
On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals, in its January 18, 2011 Decision, reversed the
lower courts’ rulings and dismissed the case without prejudice to its refiling in the proper
venue, the pertinent portions of said Decision state:
In this case, records will reveal that the first element of the offense happened in
Pampanga. It was indisputably established that the subject checks were issued to
private complainant at petitioner’s office in Pampanga. Said checks were drawn
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
from petitioner’s account in Metrobank, Pampanga branch.
The second element of the offense or the knowledge of dishonor of the checks by
the maker also transpired in Pampanga. After private complainant was informed
of the dishonor of the checks, she immediately proceeded to petitioner’s office in
Pampanga, personally informed him and his companions of the dishonor of the
checks and tendered a demand letter for the payment of the construction
materials.
Finally, the third element or dishonor of the checks by the drawee bank
also happened in Pampanga. Upon maturity of the subject checks, private
complainant deposited the same in her savings account at Equitable PCI
Bank, Makati Branch. Subsequently, she was informed by the latter bank
that the subject checks were dishonored by the drawee bank, Metrobank,
Pampanga branch.
Clearly, all the essential elements of the offense happened in Pampanga.
Consequently, the case can only be filed in said place. Unfortunately,
private complainant filed the case in Makati City, under the erroneous
assumption that since she deposited the subject checks in Equitable PCI
Bank, Makati City, and was informed of lite dishonor of the checks by the
same bank, the case may be filed in Makati City. However, as correctly
argued by the OSG, the act of depositing the check is not an essential
element of BP 22. Likewise, the fact that private complainant was
informed of the dishonor of the checks at her bank in Makati City did not
vest the MeTC, Makati City with jurisdiction to take cognizance of the
case. To reiterate, a transitory crime can only be tiled in any of the places
where its constitutive elements actually transpired. And, knowledge of
the payee of the dishonor of the checks is not an element of BP 22. The
law speaks only of the subsequent dishonor of the checks by the drawee
bank and the knowledge of the fact of dishonor by the maker.
Consequently, none of the elements of the offense can be considered to
have transpired in Makati City. Thus, the venue of the instant case was
improperly laid.[12]
Aggrieved, petitioner filed the instant action invoking the following argument:
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
I.
THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT THE
METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT OF MAKATI CITY DID NOT HAVE
JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE DESPITE A CLEAR SHOWING THAT THE
OFFENSE WAS COMMITTED WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT.[13]
Petitioner maintains that the MeTC of Makati City, the place where the dishonored checks
were deposited, had jurisdiction over the instant case. In support of her contention,
petitioner cites the ruling in Nieva, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,
[14] wherein it was held that since
the check drawn in violation of BP 22 was deposited and presented for encashment with the
Angeles City Branch of the Bank of the Philippine Islands, the RTC of Pampanga clearly had
jurisdiction over the crime of which accused therein was charged.[15] Thus, petitioner asserts
that the appellate court erred in ruling that the Makati MeTC did not have jurisdiction to try
the instant case. That none of the essential elements of the crime of violation of BP 22
occurred in the City of Makati is belied by the Nieva doctrine recognizing the jurisdiction of
the court of the place where the check was deposited and/or presented for encashment.
Petitioner went on lo state that all the elements of violation of BP 22 were duly proven
beyond reasonable doubt. First, the prosecution sufficiently established that the respondent
issued the subject checks as shown by the documentary evidence submitted. They were
issued for value, as payment for the construction supplies and materials which petitioner
delivered to the accused.
As to the second and third elements, petitioner posits that it was clearly shown that
respondent had knowledge of the insufficiency of funds in or credit with the drawee bank,
which subsequently dishonored the subject checks. Section 2 of BP 22 provides that “the
dishonor of a check when presented within ninety (90) days from the date of the check shall
be prima facie evidence of knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit unless such maker
or drawer pays the holder thereof the amount due thereon, or makes arrangements for
payment in full by the drawee of such check within five (5) banking days after receiving
notice that such check has not been paid by the drawee.” In this case, petitioner states that
the prosecution was able to sufficiently show that the subject checks were presented within
the time period required by law. In fact, written demand relaying the fact that the drawee
bank dishonored the subject checks was even personally delivered by petitioner to
respondent as evidenced by the demand letter signed by respondent. Thus, respondent
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
cannot deny that he had knowledge of the insufficiency of funds in his account with the
drawee bank and that the subject checks were subsequently dishonored for the reason that
the account from which they were drawn was already a closed account.
For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing the State, is in line with
the appellate court’s and respondent’s stance that the MeTC had no jurisdiction over the
instant case. According to the OSG, the act of depositing the check is not an essential
element of the offense under the Bouncing Checks Law. Citing the ruling in Rigor v.
People,
[16] the OSG posited that the place of deposit and the place of dishonor are distinct
from each other and that the place where the check was issued, delivered, and dishonored is
the proper venue, not the place where the check was deposited, viz.:
The evidence clearly shows that the undated check was issued and delivered at
the Rural Bank of San Juan, Metro Manila. x x x The check was deposited with PS
Bank, San Juan Branch, Metro Manila. x x x The information at bar effectively
charges San Juan as the place of drawing and issuing. The jurisdiction of courts
in criminal cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint or
information. Although the check was dishonored by the drawee, Associated Bank,
in its Tarlac Branch, appellant has drawn, issued and delivered it at RBSJ, San
Juan. The place of issue and delivery was San Juan and knowledge, as an
essential part of the offense, was also overtly manifested in San Juan. There is no
question that crimes committed in San Juan are triable by the RTC stationed in
Pasig.[17]
On the basis of the pronouncement in Rigor, the OSG thus claimed that the MeTC of Makati
City did not have jurisdiction over the instant case for none of the essential elements of
violation of BP 22 occurred therein.
The contention is untenable.
It is well settled that violations of BP 22 cases are categorized as transitory or continuing
crimes, meaning that some acts material and essential thereto and requisite in their
consummation occur in one municipality or territory, while some occur in another. In such
cases, the court wherein any of the crime’s essential and material acts have been committed
maintains jurisdiction to try the case; it being understood that the first court taking
cognizance of the same excludes the other. Thus, a person charged with a continuing or
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
transitory crime may be validly tried in any municipality or territory where the offense was
in part committed.[18]
The OSG, relying on our ruling in Rigor v. People, concluded that “the Supreme Court
regarded the place of deposit and the place of dishonor as distinct from one another and
considered the place where the check was issued, delivered and dishonored, and not where
the check was deposited, as the proper venue for the filing of a B.P. Blg. 22 case.” The
Court, however, cannot sustain such conclusion.
In said case, She accused therein obtained a loan from the Rural Bank of San Juan, Metro
Manila, and in payment thereof, he issued a check drawn against Associated Bank of Tarlac.
Thereafter, Rural Bank deposited the check at PS Bank, San Juan, but the same was
returned for the reason that it had been dishonored by Associated Bank of Tarlac. When all
other efforts to demand the repayment of the loan proved futile, Rural Bank filed an action
against the accused for violation of BP 22 at the RTC of Pasig City, wherein crimes
committed in. San Juan are triable. The accused, however, contends that the RTC of Pasig
had no jurisdiction thereon since no proof had been offered to show that his check was
issued, delivered, dishonored or that knowledge of beneficiency of funds occurred in the
Municipality of San Juan. The Court, however, disagreed and held that while the check was
dishonored by the drawee. Associated Bank, in its Tarlac Branch, evidence clearly showed
that the accused had drawn, issued and delivered it at Rural Bank, San Juan, viz.:
Lastly, positioner contends that the Regional Trial Court of Pasig had no
jurisdiction over this case since no proof has been offered that his check was
issued, delivered, dishonored or that knowledge of insufficiency of funds
occurred in the Municipality of San Juan, Metro Manila.
The contention is untenable.
x x x x.
The evidence clearly shows that the undated check was issued and delivered at
the Rural Bank of San Juan, Metro Manila on November 16, 1989, and
subsequently the check was dated February 16, 1990 thereat. On May 25, 1990,
the check was deposited with PS Bank, San Juan Branch, Metro Manila. Thus, the
Court of Appeals correctly ruled:
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
Violations of B.P. 22 are categorized as transitory or continuing
crimes. A suit on the check can be filed in any of the places where any
of the elements of the offense occurred, that is, where the check is
drawn, issued, delivered or dishonored. x x x
The information at bar effectively charges San Juan as the place
of drawing and issuing. The jurisdiction of courts in criminal
cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint or
information. Although, the check was dishonored by the
drawee, Associated Bank, sit its Tarlac Branch, appellant has
drawn, issued and delivered it at RBSJ, San Juan. The place of
issue and delivery was San Juan and knowledge, as an essential
part of the offense, was also overtly manifested in San Juan.
There is no question that crimes committed in November, 1989
in San Juan arc triable by the RTC stationed in Pasig. In short
both allegation and proof in this case sufficiently vest
jurisdiction upon the RTC in Pasig City.[19]
The bone of contention in Rigor, therefore, was whether the prosecution had offered
sufficient proof that the check drawn in violation of BP 22 was issued, delivered, dishonored
or that knowledge of insufficiency of funds occurred in the Municipality of San Juan, thereby
vesting jurisdiction upon the RTC of Pasig City. Nowhere in the cited case, however, was it
held, either expressly or impliedly, that the place where the check was deposited is not the
proper venue for actions involving violations of BP 22, it is true that the Court, in Rigor,
acknowledged the feet that the check was issued and delivered at the Rural Bank of San
Juan, while the same was deposited wilts the PS Bank of San Juan. But such differentiation
cannot be taken as basis sufficient enough to conclude that the court of the place of deposit
cannot exercise jurisdiction over violations of BP 22. In the absence, therefore, of any
ground, jurisprudential or otherwise, to sustain the OSG’s arguments, the Court cannot take
cognizance of a doctrine that is simply inapplicable to the issue at hand.
In contrast, the ruling in Nieva, Jr. v. Court of Appeals[20] cited by petitioner is more squarely
on point with the instant case. In Nieva, the accused delivered to Ramon Joven a post-dated
check drawn against the Commercial Bank of Manila as payment for Joven’s dump truck.
Said check was deposited in the Angeles City Branch of the Bank of Philippine Islands, joven
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
was advised, however, that the Commercial Bank of Manila returned the check for the
reason that the account against which the check was drawn is a “closed account.”
Consequently, the accused was charged with violation of BP 22 before the RTC of
Pampanga. On the contention of the accused that said court had no jurisdiction to try the
case, the Court categorically ruled:
As to petitioner’s contention that the Regional Trial Court of Pampanga
has no jurisdiction to try the cases charged herein as none of the
essential elements thereof took place in Pampanga, suffice it to say that
such contention has no basis. The evidence discloses that the check was
deposited and/or presented for encashment with the Angeles City Branch
of the Bank of the Philippine Islands. This fact clearly confers
jurisdiction upon the Regional Trial Court of Pampanga over the crimes
of which petitioner is charged. It must be noted that violations of B.P. Blg. 22
are categorized as transitory or continuing crimes and so is the crime of estafa.
The rule is that a person charged with a transitory crime may be validly tried in
any municipality or territory where the offense was in part committed.[21]
In fact, in the more recent Yalong v. People,
[22] wherein the modes of appeal and rules of
procedure were the issues at hand, the Court similarly inferred:
Besides, even discounting the above-discussed considerations, Yalong’s appeal
still remains dismissible on the ground that, inter alia, the MTCC had properly
acquired jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 45414. It is well-settled that
violation of BP 22 cases is categorized as transitory or continuing crimes, which
means that the acts material and essential thereto occur in one municipality or
territory, while some occur in another. Accordingly, the court wherein any of the
crime’s essential and material acts have been committed maintains jurisdiction to
try the case; it being understood that the first court taking cognizance of the
same excludes the other. Stated differently, a person charged with a continuing
or transitory crime may be validly tried in any municipality or territory where the
offense was in part committed. Applying these principles, a criminal case for
violation of BP 22 may be tiled in any of the places where any of its elements
occurred – in particular, the place where the check is drawn, issued, delivered, or
dishonored.
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
In this case, while it is undisputed that the subject check was drawn,
issued, and delivered in Manila, records reveal that Ylagan presented the
same for deposit and encashment at the LBC Bank in Batangas City
where she learned of its dishonor. As such, the MTCC [of Batangas City]
correctly took cognizance of Criminal Case No. 45414 as It had the
territorial jurisdiction to try and resolve the same. In this light, the
denial of the present petition remains warranted.[23]
Guided by the foregoing pronouncements, there is no denying, therefore, that the court of
the place where the check was deposited or presented for encashment; can be vested with
jurisdiction to try cases involving violations of BP 22. Thus, the fact that the check subject of
the instant case was drawn, issued, and delivered in Pampanga does not strip off the Makati
MeTC of its jurisdiction over the instant case for it is undisputed that the subject check was
deposited and presented for encashment at the Makati Branch of Equitable PCIBank. The
MeTC of Makati, therefore, correctly took cognizance of the instant case and rendered its
decision in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction.
It may be argued, however, that the instant petition ought to be dismissed outright due to
certain procedural infirmities. Section 35 (1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the 1987
Administrative Code provides that the OSG shall represent the Government of the
Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation,
proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of lawyers. Specifically, it shall
represent the Government in all criminal proceedings before the Supreme Court and the
Court of Appeals.[24] Thus, as a general rule, if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court
or if there is an acquittal, the appeal on the criminal aspect of the case must be instituted by
the Solicitor General on behalf of the State.[25]
There have been instances, however, where the Court permitted an offended party to file an
appeal without the intervention of the OSG, such as when the offended party questions the
civil aspect of a decision of a lower court,[26] when there is denial of due process of law to the
prosecution and the State or its agents refuse to act on the case to the prejudice of the State
and the private offended party,[27] when there is grave error committed by the judge, or
when the interest of substantial justice so requires.[28]
Corollary, a judgment of acquittal may be assailed through a petition for certiorari under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court showing that the lower court, in acquitting the accused,
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
committed not merely reversible errors of judgment, but also exercised grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, or a denial of due process, thereby
rendering the assailed judgment null and void. If there is grave abuse of discretion, granting
the aggrieved party’s prayer is not tantamount to putting the accused in double jeopardy,[29]
in violation of the general rule that the prosecution cannot appeal or bring error
proceedings from a judgment rendered in favor of the defendant in a criminal case. This is
because a judgment of acquittal is immediately final and executory, and the prosecution is
barred from appealing lest the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy be
violated.[30]
Thus, it may be argued that since the instant petition is one for review on certiorari under
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, not under Rule 65, and was not filed by the OSG representing
the interest of the Republic, the same should be summarily dismissed. The unique and
special circumstances attendant in the instant petition, however, justify an adjudication by
the Court on the merits and not solely on technical grounds.
First of all, the Court stresses that the appellate court’s dismissal of the case is not an
acquittal of respondent. Basic is the rule that a dismissal of a case is different from an
acquittal of the accused therein. Except in a dismissal based on a Demurrer to Evidence
filed by the accused, or for violation of the right of the accused to a speedy trial, the
dismissal of a criminal case against the accused will not result in his acquittal.[31] In the oftcited People v. Salico,
[32] the Court explained:
This argument or reasoning is predicated on a confusion of the legal concepts of
dismissal and acquittal. Acquittal is always based on the merits, that is, the
defendant is acquitted because the evidence does not show that
defendant’s guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt; but dismissal does tint
decide the case on the merits or that the defendant is not guilty.
Dismissal terminates the proceeding, either because the court is not a
court of competent jurisdiction, or the evidence does not show that the
offense was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, or
the complaint or information is not valid or sufficient in form and
substance, etc. The only case in which the word dismissal is commonly but not
correctly used, instead of the proper term acquittal, is when, after the
prosecution has presented all its: evidence, the defendant moves for me dismissal
and the court dismisses the ease on the ground that the evidence tails to show
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty; for in such case the
dismissal is in reality an acquittal because the case is decided on the merits. If
the prosecution fails to prove that the offense was committed within the
territorial jurisdiction of the court and the case is dismissed, the
dismissal is not an acquittal, inasmuch as if it were so the defendant
could not be again prosecuted before the court of competent jurisdiction;
and it is elemental that in such case, the defendant may again be
prosecuted for the same offense before a court of competent
jurisdiction.[33]
Thus, when the appellate court herein dismissed the instant case on the ground that the
MeTC lacked jurisdiction over the offense charged, it did not decide the same on the merits,
let alone resolve the issue of respondent’s guilt or innocence based on the evidence
proffered by the prosecution.[34] The appellate court merely dismissed the case on the
erroneous reasoning that none of the elements of BP 22 was committed within the lower
court’s jurisdiction, and not because of any finding that the evidence failed to show
respondent’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Clearly, therefore, such dismissal did not
operate as an acquittal, which, as previously discussed, may be repudiated only by a petition
for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, showing a grave abuse of discretion.
Thus, petitioner’s resort to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court cannot be struck down as
improper. In a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, the parties raise only
questions of law because the Court, in its exercise of its power of review, is not a trier of
facts. There is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on
certain state of facts and which does not call for an existence of the probative value of the
evidence presented by the parties-litigants.[35] In De Vera v. Spouses Santiago,
[36] the Court
categorically ruled that the issue of whether the appellate court erred in annulling the RTC
Decision for lack of jurisdiction is a question of law, to wit:
Undeniably, the issue whether the CA erred in annulling the RTC
Decision for lack of jurisdiction is a question of law. The resolution of
such issue rests solely on what the law [B.P. Blg. 129, as amended]
provides on the given set of circumstances as alleged in petitioners’
complaint for reconveyance of ownership and possession with damages.[37]
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
In the instant case; the lone issue invoked by petitioner is precisely “whether the Court of
Appeals erred when it ruled that the Metropolitan Trial Court of Makati City did not have
jurisdiction over the case despite clear showing that the offense was committed within the
jurisdiction of said court.” Evidently, therefore, the instant petition was filed within the
bounds of our procedural rules for the issue herein rests solely on what the law provides on
the given set of circumstances insofar as the commission of the crime of BP 22 is concerned.
In criminal cases, the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the averments of the
complaint or Information, in relation to the law prevailing at the time of the filing of the
complaint or Information, and the penalty provided by law for the crime charged at the time
of its commission.[38] Thus, when a case involves a proper interpretation of the rules and
jurisprudence with respect to the jurisdiction of courts to entertain complaints filed
therewith, it deals with a question of law that can be properly brought to this Court under
Rule 45.[39]
More importantly, moreover, since the dismissal of the instant case cannot be considered as
an acquittal of respondent herein, he cannot likewise claim that his constitutional right to
protection against double jeopardy will be violated. In Paulin v. Hon. Gimenez,
[40] the Court
held:
Jurisprudence on double jeopardy as well as the exceptions thereto which finds
application to the case at bar has been laid down by this Court as follows:
. . . However, an appeal by the prosecution from the order of
dismissal (of the criminal case) by the trial court shall not
constitute double jeopardy if (1) the dismissal is made upon
motion, or with the express consent of the defendant; (2) the
dismissal is not an acquittal or based upon consideration of the
evidence or of the merits of the case; and (3) the question to be
passed upon by the appellate court is purely legal so that
should the dismissal he found incorrect, the case would have to
be remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings, to
determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant.[41]
A cursory review of the records would readily reveal the presence of the foregoing
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
requisites. First, as early as the stage of respondent’s appeal of the MeTC’s decision to the
RTC, respondent had already been moving for the dismissal of the case alleging the ground
of lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the CA’s dismissal on said ground can rightly be
considered to have been with respondent’s express consent. Second, as earlier mentioned,
the dismissal herein is not an acquittal or based upon a consideration of the merits. Third,
the question raised in this case is based purely on a question of law. In view therefore of the
presence of all three requisites, the Court finds that petitioner’s appeal of the appellate
court’s dismissal cannot be barred by double jeopardy.
As to the issue of petitioner’s legal standing to file the instant petition in the absence of the
OSG’s participation, the circumstances herein warrant the Court’s consideration. In Narciso
v. Sta. Romana-Cruz,
[42] the Court gave due regard to the ends of substantial justice by
giving due course to a petition filed before it by the private offended party, viz.:
Citing the “ends of substantial justice,” People v. Calo, however, provided an
exception to the above doctrines in this manner:
While the rule is, as held by the Court of Appeals, only the Solicitor
General may bring or defend actions on behalf of the Republic of the
Philippines, or represent the People or the State in criminal
proceedings pending in this Court and the Court of Appeals (Republic
vs. Partisala, 118 SCRA 320 [1982]), the ends of substantial justice
would be better served, and the issues in this action could be
determined in a more just, speedy and inexpensive manner, by
entertaining the petition at bar. As an offended party in a
criminal case, private petitioner has sufficient personality and a
valid grievance against Judge Adao’s order granting bail to the
alleged murderers of his (private petitioner’s) father.
x x x x
The ends of substantial justice indeed require the affirmation of the
appellate court’s ruling on this point. Clearly, the assailed Order of Judge
Santiago was issued in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction. A void order is no order at all. It cannot confer any right or be the
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
source of any relief. This Court is not merely a court of law; it is likewise a court
of justice.
To rule otherwise would leave the private respondent without any
recourse to rectify the public injustice brought about by the trial court’s
Order, leaving her with only the standing to file administrative charges
for ignorance of the law against the judge and the prosecutor. A party
cannot be left without recourse to address a substantive issue in law.[43]
In a similar manner, the Court finds that in the interest of substantial justice, it must give
due course to the instant petition and consequently rule on the merits of the same. The
circumstances surrounding this case left petitioner with no other suitable recourse but to
appeal the case herself. Not only was there an absence of support from the OSG, said
government office also took a position in contrast to the rights and interests of petitioner.
Moreover, as discussed above, the arguments which ran counter to petitioner’s interest as
well as the grounds used to support them were simply inapplicable to the issue at hand. In
fact, these erroneous contentions were adopted by the appellate court in their entirety,
dismissing the instant case in a manner not in accord with law and applicable jurisprudence.
For the Court, now, to apply procedural rules in their strict and literal sense by similarly
dismissing, as the CA had, petitioner’s action poses serious consequences tantamount to a
miscarriage of justice. To rule that the accused can postpone criminal prosecution and delay
the administration of justice at petitioner’s expense on the erroneous ground of lack of
jurisdiction would create a hazardous precedent and open loopholes in our criminal justice
system.[44]
Indeed, the unique and exceptional circumstances in the instant case demand that the Court
forego a rigid application of the technicalities under the law so as to prevent petitioner from
suffering a grave injustice. As disclosed by the records, petitioner had already fulfilled her
end of the agreement in giving respondent, as early as in the year 2003, construction
materials amounting to half a million pesos and yet up until now, she has not been paid
therefor. In feet, after having sufficiently proven to the satisfaction of both the MeTC and
the RTC her right allegedly violated by respondent, the CA simply dismissed, albeit without
prejudice to the re-filing of the case with the appropriate court, her action for the incorrect
ground of wrong venue. On the mistaken reasoning that the MeTC of Makati City did not
have jurisdiction over the instant case, the CA, without providing any legal or
jurisprudential basis, would have petitioner start from the very beginning and re-file her
G.R. No. 198270. December 09, 2015
complaint before the same court which already had jurisdiction in the first place.
Thus, when there exists meritorious grounds to overlook strict procedural matters, the
Court cannot turn a blind eye thereto lest the administration of justice be derailed by an
overly stringent application of the rules.[45] Rules of procedure are meant to be tools to
facilitate a fair and orderly conduct of proceedings. Strict adherence thereto must not get in
the way of achieving substantial justice. As long as their purpose is sufficiently met and no
violation of due process and fair play takes place, the rules should be liberally construed.[46]
Dismissal of appeals purely on technical grounds is frowned upon where the policy of the
court is to encourage hearings of appeals on their merits and the rules of procedure ought
not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help
secure, not override substantial justice. It is a far better and more prudent course of action
for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on
appeal to attain the ends of justice rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause
a grave injustice to the parties, giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while
actually resulting in more delay, if not a miscarriage of justice.[47]

Whether the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati City had jurisdiction over the case.
Whether the proceedings in the MeTC were valid despite the absence of a public prosecutor during the retaking of petitioner’s testimony.
Whether all elements of the offense under BP 22 were proven beyond reasonable doubt.

The Court of Appeals reversed the lower courts' decisions, ruling that the essential elements of the offense happened in Pampanga, thus the case should be filed there. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Makati MeTC had jurisdiction based on the Nieva doctrine, which recognizes jurisdiction where the check was deposited or presented for encashment."

[ G.R. No. 258257. August 09, 2023 ]
PEDRO “PEPE” TALISAY, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



GESMUNDO, C.J.:
This Appeal by Certiorari[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the August 28, 2020 Decision[2] and the July 21, 2021 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CR No. 03427. The CA affirmed with modification the January 11, 2019 Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court, x x x xx x x xxxx (RTC), in Criminal Case No. R-PAL-17-2246-CR, finding Pedro “Pepe” Talisay (petitioner) guilty of violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, committed against AAA.[5] The assailed CA Decision modified the RTC Decision by amending the nomenclature of the crime and the amount of damages awarded by the said trial court.


Petitioner was charged with Violation of Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 in an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about September 29, 2016, in x x x xx x x xxxx Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, PEDRO “PEPE” TALISAY, with deliberate intent and moved by lewd design, taking advantage of the minority of his 15-year old victim, [AAA], and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and criminally commit acts of lasciviousness upon her, by kissing her on her cheeks, removing her pants and panty, and satisfying [his] sexual desire by placing his penis outside of her vagina, which acts are constitutive of sexual abuse which debases, degrades or demeans her intrinsic worth and dignity as a human being, to the damage and prejudice of the said victim.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6]

During arraignment on November 3, 2017, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.[7] After pre-trial was terminated, trial on the merits ensued.[8]



The prosecution presented AAA, the private complainant, whose testimony was summarized by the CA, as follows:

On September 29, 2016 at around 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon, while the victim was fetching water from the faucet of “Kapitana” located in x x x xx x x xxxx Leyte, the [appellant] followed and caught her [a]nd dragged her to the pig pen.

Thereat, [appellant] first kissed both che[e]ks of the victim causing her to tremble [in] fear. Thereafter, [appellant] removed totally his clothes thereby exposing his penis and whole body which the victim saw. Then [appellant] removed the victim’s clothes, shortpants (sic) and panty, and let her stand. While both of them were in standing position and both naked, [appellant], without the victim’s consent and against her will, placed his penis on top/outside of her vagina. The victim resisted, pushed and shouted at the [appellant] not to do it because her body was already shaking as she was being attacked by her ailment – the epilepsy. But the [appellant] did not listen and just continued with his lustful desire on the victim and did push and pull movements. Then [appellant] wiped the victim’s face and gave the victim two (2) pieces of [P]100 bills with the instruction not to tell her (victim[‘s]) mother that he ([appellant]) gave her money. Despite [appellant’s] instruction, the victim told her mother what happened to her in the hands of [appellant].[9]



The defense presented petitioner, his wife x x x xx x x xxxx, and their son x x x xx x x xxxx, as its witnesses.

As synthesized by the CA, the version of the defense is as follows:

On September 22, 2016, [appellant] and his wife x x x xx x x xxxx were attending to their sari-sari store while their son x x x xx x x xxxx was watching television. Then the victim and her younger sister, who were outside of [appellant’s] house, asked for water from the [appellant]. [Appellant] gave the two children water which they dr[a]nk. But after the victim dr[a]nk the water, she collapsed as she is suffering from epilepsy. When the victim regained her consciousness, she asked for food as she was hungry. Everytime (sic) the victim is attacked by her ailment and after regaining consciousness, she would always feel hungry. These facts are known in their place since the victim was still young.

As the family of the [appellant] had no more food and because of pity, x x x xx x x xxxx the wife of the [appellant], gave [P]200 to her husband, and told him to give it to the victim and her younger sister to which [appellant] did.

On September 28, 2016, [appellant], together with his wife, and the parents of the victim, were at the Office of the Punong Barangay of x x x xx x x xxxx because of the complaint filed by [BBB], the mother of the victim. [BBB] was under the belief that [appellant] did something wrong to the victim that was why he gave [P]200.00 to the victim. During the confrontation, the victim was asked by Brgy. Chairman Rubilita Asuero if [appellant] touched and sexually abused her to which the latter answered in the negative. [Appellant] reasoned out that they gave money to the victim because he and his wife just pitied them. Then Brgy. Chairman Asuero let the [appellant] signed (sic) a “Kasarabutan” committing that he would no longer be giving money to any child. The said document was also signed by the mother of the victim, [BBB].

On September 29, 2016, at around 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon, [appellant], [his] wife x x x xx x x xxxx, and son x x x xx x x xxxx were just at home. On the said date, [appellant] and [his] wife attended their store the whole day, from morning until afternoon while their son x x x xx x x xxxx was watching television also the whole day. Never that (sic) [appellant] left their house the whole day nor did they take a nap or sleep. In the evening, [appellant] did not leave also their house. Hence, the allegations of the victim that [appellant] sexually abused her are not true.[10]

In its January 11, 2019 Decision, the RTC gave more credence to AAA’s testimony than petitioner’s twin defenses of denial and alibi. It held that AAA’s testimony was given in a “candid, straightforward, firm and unwavering”[11] manner. Also, the delay of two days in reporting the incident to her mother and the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of AAA were insufficient to deflate her credibility.[12] The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of acts of lasciviousness in relation to Republic Act 7610 and is hereby sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 14 years and 8 months of reclusion temporal as minimum to 20 years of reclusion temporal as maximum and ordered to pay the victim [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages and a fine of [P]15,000.00.

SO ORDERED.[13]

Aggrieved, petitioner appealed said RTC Decision before the CA.



In its August 28, 2020 Decision, the CA affirmed with modification the ruling of the RTC. It held that the prosecution successfully established the elements of lascivious conduct and found AAA’s testimony credible because she was able to steadily recount petitioner’s immodest acts.[14] Moreover, the alleged inconsistencies in AAA’s testimony as to who were present at the place of the incident and the exact date when the money was given, were trivial and do not affect the central fact of the crime. The CA opined that AAA’s testimony was clearly consistent with the substantial aspects of the crime, i.e., the identification of petitioner as the perpetrator and the manner by which the crime was committed.[15]
The CA, however, held that the proper nomenclature of the offense committed should be “Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610” instead of “Acts of Lasciviousness in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.”[16] It likewise increased the amount of damages in accordance with this Court’s ruling in People v. Tulagan.[17] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated January 11, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court, x x x xx x x xxxx Leyte in Criminal Case No. R-PAL-17-2246-CR is hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Pedro “Pepe” Talisay is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal, as maximum. He is likewise ORDERED to pay AAA the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos ([P]50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos ([P]50,000.00) as moral damages, and Fifty Thousand Pesos ([P]50,000.00) as exemplary damages. An interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the monetary awards reckoned from the finality of this Decision is likewise imposed.

SO ORDERED.[18] (Italics supplied)

Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration[19] which the CA denied in its July 21, 2021 Resolution. Unfazed, petitioner filed this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, essentially raising the sole issue:

Whether the CA erred in affirming the decision of the RTC finding petitioner guilty of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.

Petitioner argues that the testimony of AAA was incredible and tainted with inconsistencies.[20] He claims that the prosecution was not able to prove all the elements of lascivious conduct because the element of force or coercion was lacking. Petitioner insists that AAA did not manifest any resistance at the time of the incident.[21] Lastly, petitioner asserts that even if the defense admitted the age of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime, the presentation of the birth certificate is still the best evidence to prove AAA’s age. Thus, AAA’s age was not duly proven by competent evidence due to the non-presentation of her birth certificate.[22]

In its Comment,[23] the People of the Philippines, as represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), maintains that the issues raised by petitioner are mere reiterations of his previous arguments.[24] It underscores that the minor inconsistencies in AAA’s testimony were due to the misleading questions propounded to her by the defense counsel. The OSG emphasizes that AAA was empathic and consistent in her assertion regarding petitioner’s molestation of her in the pigpen where she even suffered an epileptic episode.[25] It also highlights that questions of fact cannot be raised by petitioner in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[26]


At the outset, it must be pointed out that the issue raised by petitioner is clearly a question of fact which requires a review of the evidence presented before the trial court. As a rule, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 covers only questions of law. Questions of fact cannot be reevaluated and passed upon by this Court in the exercise of its power to review. The distinction between questions of law and questions of fact is well-settled. A question of law exists when the doubt or difference centers on what the law is on a certain state of facts. On the other hand, a question of fact exists if there is doubt on the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. This being so, the findings of fact of the CA are final and conclusive and this Court will not review them on appeal.[27]
However, this rule is not iron-clad, and is subject to well-known exceptions, such as when (1) the conclusion is grounded on speculations, surmises, or conjectures; (2) the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) there is no citation of specific evidence on which the factual findings are based; (7) the findings of absence of facts are contradicted by the presence of evidence on record; (8) the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; (9) the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; (10) the findings of the CA are beyond the issues of the case; and (11) such findings are contrary to the admissions of both parties.[28] However, this Court finds that petitioner failed to substantiate his claim that the case falls under any of the exceptions.

In any event, the petition must still be denied for lack of merit.

In the present appeal, petitioner points out AAA’s alleged lack of credibility as a witness. Well-entrenched is the rule that the trial courts’ evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is entitled to the highest respect and will not be disturbed on appeal considering that the trial court was in a better position to decide such question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial. Accordingly, its findings on the issue of credibility of witnesses and the consequent findings of fact must be given great weight and respect on appeal, unless certain facts of substance and value have been overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.[29]

Here, both the RTC and the CA found AAA’s testimony to be straightforward and candid. This Court sees no cogent reason to depart from the foregoing rule since petitioner failed to demonstrate that the RTC and the CA overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied facts of weight and substance that would alter the assailed decision. Moreover, this Court, in the past, had given full weight and credence to the testimony of child victims whose “[y]outh and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.”[30]

Petitioner’s lascivious conduct

According to AAA, petitioner placed his penis on top of her vagina.[31] Petitioner was charged with Acts of Lasciviousness under Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 for unlawfully satisfying his bestial desires by placing his penis upon AAA’s vagina through coercion. However, the CA changed the nomenclature of the crime from Acts of Lasciviousness to Lascivious Conduct for the same factual allegations and under the same penal law.

For clarity, this Court deems it proper to determine whether the act of petitioner in placing his penis on top of the victim’s vagina constitutes as either consummated rape, attempted rape, acts of lasciviousness, or lascivious conduct under R.A. No. 7610.

In People v. Puertollano,[32] this Court held that the mere touching by the male’s organ of the labia of the pudendum of the woman’s private parts is sufficient to consummate rape. Full or deep penetration of the victim’s vagina is not necessary to consummate sexual intercourse; even the slightest penetration of the male organ into the female sex organ is sufficient to warrant conviction for consummated rape.[33]

However, there must be sufficient and convincing proof that the penis indeed touched the labias or slid into the female organ, and not merely stroked the external surface thereof, for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape. Since the labias, which are required to be “touched” by the penis, are by their natural situs or location beneath the mons pubis or the vaginal surface, to touch them with the penis is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface, hence, the conclusion that touching the labia majora or the labia minora of the pudendum constitutes consummated rape.[34] Accordingly, a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the mons pubis of the pudendum is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching of either labia of the pudendum by the penis, there can be no consummated rape to speak of; at most, the crime committed can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness.[35]

Under Article 6, in relation to Art. 335, of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), rape is attempted when the offender commences the commission of the rape directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the crime of rape by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.

In People v. Campuhan[36] (Campuhan), this Court ruled that therein accused was guilty only of attempted rape and not consummated rape because the prosecution failed utterly to discharge its onus of proving that the accused’s penis was able to penetrate the victim’s vagina however slight. The Court observed that the possibility of penetration is belied by the victim’s own assertion that she resisted the accused’s advances by putting her legs close together. It is noteworthy that in cases where penetration was not fully established, this Court had anchored its conclusion that rape nevertheless was consummated on the victim’s testimony that she felt pain, or the medico-legal finding of discoloration in the inner lips of the vagina, or that the labia minora was already gaping with redness, or the hymenal tags were no longer visible.[37] None of the foregoing was shown in that case. Thus, in Campuhan, the crime committed was only attempted rape.

In Cruz v. People,[38] this Court explained that “the intent of the offender to lie with the female defines the distinction between attempted rape and acts of lasciviousness. It was clarified that attempted rape requires such intent while acts of lasciviousness does not. Only the direct overt acts of the offender establish the intent to lie with the female. The Court declared, however, that mere climbing on top of a naked female does not constitute attempted rape without proof of his erectile penis being in a position to penetrate the female’s vagina.”[39]

In the recent case of People v. Agao[40] (Agao), the Court definitely resolved when can the touching of the female organ by the male organ be considered as either consummated rape, attempted rape, or acts of lasciviousness, to wit:

Guided by the foregoing anatomical description, the Court now reiterates, even as it clarifies, that rape of a female victim by a male person through penile penetration reaches the consummated stage as soon as the penis penetrates the cleft of the labia majora, also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, in even at the slightest degree. Simply put, mere introduction, however slight, into the cleft of the labia majora by a penis that is capable of penetration, regardless of whether such penile penetration is thereafter fully achieved, consummates the crime of rape.[41]

x x x x

Given the foregoing, for as long as the prosecutorial evidence is able to establish that the penis of the accused penetrated the vulval cleft or the cleft of the labia majora (i.e., the cleft of the fleshy outer lip of the victim’s vagina), however slight the introduction may be, the commission of rape already crossed the threshold of the attempted stage and into its consummation. On the factual appreciation of whether this minimum threshold genital contact is obtained in an allegation of rape, the same is rightly left to the trial court’s astute assessment from the entirety of the body of proof presented in each case.[42]

Further to the instant clarification, in the converse, the Court also clarifies that when there is no touching by the penis of the vulval cleft of the victim’s genetalia in a case of rape through penile penetration, there can be no finding of consummated rape but only attempted rape or acts of lasciviousness, as the case may be, with the distinctions determinable based on various indications that may reveal either the absence or presence of “intent to lie” on the part of the accused, which include the presence of an erect penis.[43] (Emphases and citations omitted)

Accordingly, pursuant to Agao, there is consummated rape when the penis penetrates the cleft of the labia majora, also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, even in the slightest degree. Upon such slightest penetration of the penis to the cleft of the labia majora, the commission of rape already crosses the threshold of the attempted stage into its consummation. In contrast, when there is no touching of the penis of the vulval cleft of the labia majora of the victim, there can be no finding of consummated rape. Rather, it is considered either only as attempted rape or acts of lasciviousness, as the case may be, with the distinctions determinable based on various indications that may reveal either the absence or presence of “intent to lie” on the part of the accused.

In other words, when the penis of the offender merely strokes the external surface of the victim’s vagina, the same cannot be considered as consummated rape. Rather, it can be classified only as either attempted rape or acts of lasciviousness. It is considered attempted rape if it can be established that the offender had the criminal intent to lie with the victim. If such intent to lie or have carnal knowledge is not established, then the crime committed is only acts of lasciviousness under the RPC, or lascivious conduct, if it falls under Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.

In Agao, the Court also stated that on the factual appreciation of whether or not this minimum threshold genital contact is obtained in an allegation of rape, the same is left to the trial court’s astute and insightful assessment from the entirety of the evidence proffered in each case.[44]

In the instant case, the testimony of AAA demonstrates that petitioner placed his penis outside her vagina while they were standing up and made a push and pull movement:

Nowhere in the statement of AAA does it show, whether expressly or impliedly, that petitioner’s penis, although placed on top of her vagina, touched either the labia majora or the labia minora of the pudendum. AAA was asked thrice regarding how petitioner committed the act of sexual molestation and she consistently answered that petitioner only placed his penis on top of her vagina. Thus, there can be no consummated rape as there was no slightest penetration of the female organ.

Further, the jurisprudential guideposts to establish carnal knowledge, which were discussed in Agao, do not exist in this case. Pursuant to Agao, these jurisprudential guideposts provide that when the necessary genital contact is not explicitly described through the testimony of the victim, whether minor or otherwise, courts can base their appreciation of the genital contact on other aspects that would similarly illustrate the occurrence and circumstance of penile penetration. These guideposts which are appreciable in all rape cases may reasonably find sharper import with respect to cases of rape involving minor victims, especially in view of the inherent limitations of the child witness’ testimony. The courts are, therefore, enjoined to exercise circumspection and use the following surrounding or attendant circumstances to aid them in their appreciation of penile penetration: (i) when the victim testifies that she felt pain in her genitals; (ii) when there is bleeding in the same; (iii) when the labia minora was observed to be gaping or has redness or otherwise discolored; (iv) when the hymenal tags are no longer visible; or (v) when the sex organ of the victim has sustained any other type of injury.[46]

Here, the testimony of AAA does not demonstrate that any of the above-­mentioned circumstances were present to imply that petitioner had carnal knowledge of AAA. Again, at best, the evidence established that petitioner placed his penis outside the victim’s genitals, without any indication that there was the slightest penetration.

Neither can petitioner’s act be considered as attempted rape. The record is bereft of any showing that when petitioner placed his penis on top of the victim’s vagina, he had ultimate intent of having carnal knowledge of AAA. As stated in Agao, one of the indications that an accused had intent to lie with the victim in the crime of attempted rape is when the perpetrator had an erect penis.[47]

In the case at bench, it does not appear that the direct overt acts of petitioner establish the intent to lie with AAA. Instead, he completed his lustful desire simply by placing his penis on top of the victim’s vagina and by doing a push and pull movement without any indication that he had the intent to commit the slightest penetration of the cleft of the labia majora.

Undoubtedly, the crime committed by petitioner is Lascivious Conduct under Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, which provides:

Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

x x x x

(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or [subjected] to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the [victim] is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period[.]

The elements of sexual abuse or lascivious conduct under Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 are as follows:

(1)
The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct;
(2)
The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and
(3)
The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.[48]
Under Sec. 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 7610, lascivious conduct is defined as the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus, or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse, or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals, or pubic area of a person.[49]

The prosecution’s evidence had sufficiently established the elements of lascivious conduct under Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. The evidence confirms that petitioner committed lascivious acts against AAA, who narrated that on September 29, 2016, petitioner dragged her to the unused pigpen of “Kapitana” where he kissed her cheeks and thereafter removed both his and AAA’s clothes. Petitioner then placed his penis on top of, and rubbed it against, her vagina. The victim even suffered an epileptic seizure during the ordeal. Undoubtedly, the foregoing overt acts of petitioner qualify as lascivious conduct under Sec. 2(h) of the IRR of R.A. No. 7610.

Minority of the victim

Lastly, contrary to petitioner’s claim, his express and clear admission of the victim’s minority during the pre-trial conference before the RTC is conclusive proof of the victim’s age.[50] Such admission by the defense during pre-trial was never raised as an issue during trial. In People v. XXX,[51] this Court reiterated the following guidelines in appreciating age either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance:

The Court laid down the following controlling guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance:

In order to remove any confusion that may be engendered by the foregoing cases, we hereby set the following guidelines in appreciating age either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance.

1. The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.

2. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents, such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim, would suffice to prove age.

3. If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim’s mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended [party] pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:

a. If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;

b. If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;

c. If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.

4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim’s mother or relatives concerning the victim’s age, the complainant’s testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.

5. It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.[52] (Emphasis supplied).

It is undisputed that AAA was only 15 years old at the time of the sexual molestation. During pre-trial, the defense made an express and clear admission that the victim was only 15 years old at the time of the alleged commission of the crime and for which reason, the presentation of the Local Civil Registrar of Tobango, Leyte was dispensed with.[53] This sufficiently constitutes as conclusive proof of AAA’s minority and age.
 

Coercion or intimidation; denial and alibi are weak defenses
 
There is likewise no dispute that petitioner employed intimidation or coercion in achieving his bestial desires. In Caballo v. People,[54] this Court held that sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult exists when there is some form of compulsion equivalent to intimidation and it subdues the exercise of the offended party’s free will.[55]

As correctly observed by the CA, it appears from AAA’s testimony that petitioner dragged her to an unused pig pen, where he kissed her and thereafter, removed her clothes; that she was already trembling as she was afraid of him; that she did not give her consent for petitioner to do anything to her and even shouted for petitioner to stop because her body was already shaking due to epilepsy; and that she resisted his sexual advances by pushing him. Still, petitioner simply ignored her plea. Clearly, the lascivious conduct was done through force or coercion.

Petitioner’s bare denial and alibi cannot be given greater evidentiary weight than AAA’s testimony pointing to petitioner as the person who sexually abused her. Denial, being self-serving, is inherently weak and is looked upon with great disfavor.[56] Also, while alibi can be considered as a valid defense, the following elements must be alleged and proven for such to be entitled to merit: (a) that the accused was present at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime, and (b) that it was physically impossible for accused to be at the scene of the crime during its commission. “Physical impossibility refers to distance and the facility of access between the crime scene and the location of the accused when the crime was committed. The accused must demonstrate that he or she was so far away and could not have been physically present at the crime scene and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed.”[57] Here, petitioner miserably failed to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime which was only a few meters from his home where he claimed to have been staying when the incident happened.

Viewed in the light of the foregoing, there is no reason to deviate from the similar findings of the RTC and the CA that the prosecution had successfully established all the elements of Lascivious Conduct under Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.

Proper penalty

This Court, however, deems it proper to modify the imposable penalty because the CA failed to apply the Indeterminate Sentence Law.

Considering that AAA was only 15 years old at the time of the incident, the prescribed penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua. In the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the maximum term of the sentence shall be taken from the medium period thereof, which is reclusion temporal maximum. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that R.A. No. 7610 is a special law, the Indeterminate Sentence Law shall still be applied. In applying its provisions, the minimum term shall be taken from within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, which is prision mayor in its medium period to reclusion temporal in its minimum period.[58] Thus, petitioner shall suffer the indeterminate sentence of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, for violation of Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.

As correctly applied by the CA, pursuant to People v. Tulagan,[59] the amount of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages awarded for “Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610,” where the victim is a child below 18 years of age and the penalty imposed is within the range of reclusion temporal medium, is Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) each. Further, as correctly held by the CA, an interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on the monetary awards should be imposed and reckoned from the finality of the judgment until said amounts are fully paid.

WHEREFORE, the Augusf28, 2020 Decision and July 21, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CR No. 03427 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Pedro “Pepe” Talisay is GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, and is SENTENCED to suffer the indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum. He is likewise ORDERED to PAY AAA the amounts of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages, and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) by way of exemplary damages. Interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum is imposed on all the damages awarded from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.”

Hernando, Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","
Petitioner was charged with Violation of Sec. 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 in an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about September 29, 2016, in x x x xx x x xxxx Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, PEDRO “PEPE” TALISAY, with deliberate intent and moved by lewd design, taking advantage of the minority of his 15-year old victim, [AAA], and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and criminally commit acts of lasciviousness upon her, by kissing her on her cheeks, removing her pants and panty, and satisfying [his] sexual desire by placing his penis outside of her vagina, which acts are constitutive of sexual abuse which debases, degrades or demeans her intrinsic worth and dignity as a human being, to the damage and prejudice of the said victim.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6]

During arraignment on November 3, 2017, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.[7] After pre-trial was terminated, trial on the merits ensued.[8]



The prosecution presented AAA, the private complainant, whose testimony was summarized by the CA, as follows:

On September 29, 2016 at around 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon, while the victim was fetching water from the faucet of “Kapitana” located in x x x xx x x xxxx Leyte, the [appellant] followed and caught her [a]nd dragged her to the pig pen.

Thereat, [appellant] first kissed both che[e]ks of the victim causing her to tremble [in] fear. Thereafter, [appellant] removed totally his clothes thereby exposing his penis and whole body which the victim saw. Then [appellant] removed the victim’s clothes, shortpants (sic) and panty, and let her stand. While both of them were in standing position and both naked, [appellant], without the victim’s consent and against her will, placed his penis on top/outside of her vagina. The victim resisted, pushed and shouted at the [appellant] not to do it because her body was already shaking as she was being attacked by her ailment – the epilepsy. But the [appellant] did not listen and just continued with his lustful desire on the victim and did push and pull movements. Then [appellant] wiped the victim’s face and gave the victim two (2) pieces of [P]100 bills with the instruction not to tell her (victim[‘s]) mother that he ([appellant]) gave her money. Despite [appellant’s] instruction, the victim told her mother what happened to her in the hands of [appellant].[9]



The defense presented petitioner, his wife x x x xx x x xxxx, and their son x x x xx x x xxxx, as its witnesses.

As synthesized by the CA, the version of the defense is as follows:

On September 22, 2016, [appellant] and his wife x x x xx x x xxxx were attending to their sari-sari store while their son x x x xx x x xxxx was watching television. Then the victim and her younger sister, who were outside of [appellant’s] house, asked for water from the [appellant]. [Appellant] gave the two children water which they dr[a]nk. But after the victim dr[a]nk the water, she collapsed as she is suffering from epilepsy. When the victim regained her consciousness, she asked for food as she was hungry. Everytime (sic) the victim is attacked by her ailment and after regaining consciousness, she would always feel hungry. These facts are known in their place since the victim was still young.

As the family of the [appellant] had no more food and because of pity, x x x xx x x xxxx the wife of the [appellant], gave [P]200 to her husband, and told him to give it to the victim and her younger sister to which [appellant] did.

On September 28, 2016, [appellant], together with his wife, and the parents of the victim, were at the Office of the Punong Barangay of x x x xx x x xxxx because of the complaint filed by [BBB], the mother of the victim. [BBB] was under the belief that [appellant] did something wrong to the victim that was why he gave [P]200.00 to the victim. During the confrontation, the victim was asked by Brgy. Chairman Rubilita Asuero if [appellant] touched and sexually abused her to which the latter answered in the negative. [Appellant] reasoned out that they gave money to the victim because he and his wife just pitied them. Then Brgy. Chairman Asuero let the [appellant] signed (sic) a “Kasarabutan” committing that he would no longer be giving money to any child. The said document was also signed by the mother of the victim, [BBB].

On September 29, 2016, at around 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon, [appellant], [his] wife x x x xx x x xxxx, and son x x x xx x x xxxx were just at home. On the said date, [appellant] and [his] wife attended their store the whole day, from morning until afternoon while their son x x x xx x x xxxx was watching television also the whole day. Never that (sic) [appellant] left their house the whole day nor did they take a nap or sleep. In the evening, [appellant] did not leave also their house. Hence, the allegations of the victim that [appellant] sexually abused her are not true.[10]",Whether the CA erred in affirming the decision of the RTC finding petitioner guilty of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.,"In its January 11, 2019 Decision, the RTC gave more credence to AAA’s testimony than petitioner’s twin defenses of denial and alibi. It held that AAA’s testimony was given in a “candid, straightforward, firm and unwavering”[11] manner. Also, the delay of two days in reporting the incident to her mother and the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of AAA were insufficient to deflate her credibility.[12] The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of acts of lasciviousness in relation to Republic Act 7610 and is hereby sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 14 years and 8 months of reclusion temporal as minimum to 20 years of reclusion temporal as maximum and ordered to pay the victim [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages and a fine of [P]15,000.00.

SO ORDERED.[13]

Aggrieved, petitioner appealed said RTC Decision before the CA.

In its August 28, 2020 Decision, the CA affirmed with modification the ruling of the RTC. It held that the prosecution successfully established the elements of lascivious conduct and found AAA’s testimony credible because she was able to steadily recount petitioner’s immodest acts.[14] Moreover, the alleged inconsistencies in AAA’s testimony as to who were present at the place of the incident and the exact date when the money was given, were trivial and do not affect the central fact of the crime. The CA opined that AAA’s testimony was clearly consistent with the substantial aspects of the crime, i.e., the identification of petitioner as the perpetrator and the manner by which the crime was committed.[15]
The CA, however, held that the proper nomenclature of the offense committed should be “Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610” instead of “Acts of Lasciviousness in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.”[16] It likewise increased the amount of damages in accordance with this Court’s ruling in People v. Tulagan.[17] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated January 11, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court, x x x xx x x xxxx Leyte in Criminal Case No. R-PAL-17-2246-CR is hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Pedro “Pepe” Talisay is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal, as maximum. He is likewise ORDERED to pay AAA the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos ([P]50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos ([P]50,000.00) as moral damages, and Fifty Thousand Pesos ([P]50,000.00) as exemplary damages. An interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the monetary awards reckoned from the finality of this Decision is likewise imposed.

SO ORDERED.[18] (Italics supplied)

Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration[19] which the CA denied in its July 21, 2021 Resolution. Unfazed, petitioner filed this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court


Petitioner argues that the testimony of AAA was incredible and tainted with inconsistencies.[20] He claims that the prosecution was not able to prove all the elements of lascivious conduct because the element of force or coercion was lacking. Petitioner insists that AAA did not manifest any resistance at the time of the incident.[21] Lastly, petitioner asserts that even if the defense admitted the age of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime, the presentation of the birth certificate is still the best evidence to prove AAA’s age. Thus, AAA’s age was not duly proven by competent evidence due to the non-presentation of her birth certificate.[22]

In its Comment,[23] the People of the Philippines, as represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), maintains that the issues raised by petitioner are mere reiterations of his previous arguments.[24] It underscores that the minor inconsistencies in AAA’s testimony were due to the misleading questions propounded to her by the defense counsel. The OSG emphasizes that AAA was empathic and consistent in her assertion regarding petitioner’s molestation of her in the pigpen where she even suffered an epileptic episode.[25] It also highlights that questions of fact cannot be raised by petitioner in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.[26]

Marken, Incorporated (petitioner), now known as Aquasalina Incorporated, is the owner of two parcels of land located at Barangays San Agustin and Bubog Central, Municipality of San Jose, Province of Occidental Mindoro (subject properties).[6] The subject properties are covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. T-13682 and T-13683 with an aggregate area of 411.2680 and 100.2302 hectares, respectively.[7]
On August 12, 1998, a Notice of Coverage and field Investigation[8] was sent to petitioner notifying the latter that the subject properties were placed under the Compulsory Acquisition Scheme of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) of the government under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657.[9]

Pursuant to its mandate, Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) determined the value of the subject properties based on valuation inputs, and prepared their Memoranda of Valuation, Claim Folder Profile, and Valuation Summaries of Agricultural Land (MOV-CFPVS),[10] as follows: For TCT No. T-13682 with total value of P11,648,130.73 and TCT No. T-13683 with total value of P7,882,623.22.[11]

Subsequently, on September 8, 2000 and February 20, 2001, public respondent Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) requested that the compensation proceeds in the amount of P10,289,122.78 and P1,359,007.95 be deposited, in connection with the value regarding TCT No. T-13682. In compliance thereto, LBP deposited the following amounts in the name of petitioner, as evidenced by the Certifications dated September 11, 2000, March 9, 2001, March 13, 2001, and May 24, 2002, thus:

P11,648,130.73 for 319.1552 hectares of land covered by TCT No. T-13682 7,882,623.22 for 88.8800 hectares of land covered by TCT No. T-13683.[12]

When petitioner rejected the valuation, the matter was referred to public respondent DARAB for summary administrative proceedings for the fixing of just compensation.[13]



On September 5, 2011, the DARAB rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, ORDER is hereby issued:

1. ADOPTING the valuation in the total amount of ELEVEN MILLION SIX HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PESOS and 73/100 (P11,648,130.73) for TCT No. T-13682 with an area of 319.1552 hectares and SEVEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THREE and 22/100 (P7,882,623.22) for TCT No. T-13683 with an area of 88.8800 hectares as compensation due the landowner, Marken, Incorporated, now Aqua Salina, Inc., located at Barangays San Agustin and Bubog Central, Municipality of San Jose, Province of Occidental Mindoro, computed as follows:

 2. DIRECTING the LBP to recompute the additional compensation package for the necessary improvements which redounded to the benefit of the farmer-beneficiaries; and

3. DIRECTING the LBP, through its Land Valuation Office to effect immediate payment to the petitioner, Marken, Incorporated, now Aqua Salina, the amount due the landowner as computed in paragraph 1 hereof, after deducting the amount withdrawn, if any upon receipt of the claim folder/s of the registered landowner, her heirs, assigns[,] and successors-in-interest subject to existing rules and regulations.

SO ORDERED.[14]

The DARAB adopted the amount of just compensation as determined by the LBP and held that the landowner failed to support its alleged valuation on just compensation for the subject properties by clear and convincing evidence. It was underscored that petitioner did not present any evidence that would overcome the presumption of regularity of LBP’s actions. DARAB also noted the following: 1) petitioner failed to provide proof that it was exempted from coverage of the CARP; 2) in 1998, DAR cancelled the Order of Deferment of the previous owner of the subject properties, allowing the properties to be covered by the CARP law; 3) the field investigation reports revealed that the subject properties were classified as idle lands and were used as rice land only in 1999; and 4) LBP was guided by the valuation factors in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 to value the subject properties.[15]

Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated October 5, 2011 praying that the just compensation computed by the LBP and adopted by the DARAB be reconsidered. Petitioner claimed that the actual value of the subject properties should not be lower than P160,604,800.00. However, petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied by DARAB in its Resolution dated September 13, 2012, declaring that the determination of just compensation had been exhaustively discussed in the September 5, 2011 Decision.[16]

Aggrieved, petitioner filed a Petition for Review[17] under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court before the CA.



In its April 24, 2015 Decision, the CA dismissed the petition for review and affirmed the decision of the DARAB. The fallo of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Petition for Review is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed Decision dated September 5, 2011 and the September 13, 2012 Resolution issued by the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) in DARAB Case No. JC-­IV-0330-OCC-MDO-CO-02 are AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[18]

The CA held that petitioner resorted to the wrong mode of appeal and should have filed a petition for determination of just compensation with the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) as mandated by Sec. 6, Rule XIX of the 2009 DARAB Rules of Procedure,[19] implementing Sec. 57 of R.A. No. 6657. The failure of petitioner to follow this procedure rendered the decision of the DARAB final and executory.[20]

Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied by the CA via its October 1, 2015 Resolution.

Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari essentially raising the following



(1)
Whether the CA erred when it failed to consider that the petition filed before it was to seek redress for the erroneous disposition by the DAR on placing the subject properties under the CARP of the government;
(2)
Whether the CA erred when it failed to consider that the “just compensation” for the subject properties should be based on their classification as prawn and fishpond and not agricultural land.[21]
Petitioner argues that its appeal to the CA was primarily to seek redress for the correction of the erroneous disposition by the DAR of placing the subject properties under the CARP rather than for simple determination of just compensation. The subject properties were undisputed by public respondents to have been previously utilized in salt production, and later as fishponds and for prawn farming. It avers that under R.A. No. 6657, fishponds and prawn farms were categorized as commercial farms eligible for a ten-year deferment period and that a Deferment Order was issued in favor of its predecessor-in­-interest effective 1988 to 1998. While under this deferment period, R.A. No. 7881[22] was enacted, expressly exempting fishponds and prawn farms from its coverage. Petitioner also adds that in 1995, the subject properties were re-zoned as an industrial area under Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Resolution No. 5403. It points out that DAR had cancelled said Order of Deferment despite the foregoing exemptions, but the DARAB made no determination on such issue.[23] It insists that the just compensation for the subject properties should be based on their classification as prawn farms and fishponds and not as agricultural land. Finally, petitioner contends that the LBP failed to consider the value of the improvements introduced on the subject properties by their previous owners in the determination of just compensation.[24]

In its Comment,[25] LBP argues that the issues posited by petitioner are mere rehash of the arguments previously presented before the CA which had already been squarely passed upon and resolved by the said court. Thus, LBP agrees with the CA’s ruling that due to petitioner’s resort to the wrong remedy, the DARAB Decision and Resolution had become final and executory. The issue of just compensation would then constitute res judicata on the matter, barring judicial review.[26] LBP further argues that the subject properties are not exempt from CARP coverage as there was no appeal by petitioner on the DAR Order to include the subject properties from the coverage of the CARP.[27] Finally, LBP argues that the computation on just compensation was based on the applicable laws.[28]

Meanwhile, in their Comment,[29] DAR and DARAB reiterated the same arguments of LBP that the DARAB Decision and Resolution had already become final and executory,[30] adding that DARAB had legally adopted LBP’s valuations relative to the amount of just compensation as laid down by the law. The DAR and DARAB concluded that LBP’s valuations were products of meticulous ocular inspections and computations which took into consideration the factors specified under existing rules.[31]

In its Consolidated Reply,[32] petitioner reiterates the arguments in its petition, claiming that the inclusion of the subject properties to the CARP was an “unlawful taking” as the same should never have been placed under the latter’s coverage.[33] Petitioner adds that public respondents disregarded the actual use of the properties and the valuations made by independent appraisers. The latter valued the subject properties at P188,257,000.00, the Municipal Assessor of Mindoro valued the subject properties at P169,806,325.00, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) valued the subject properties at P220,500.00 per hectare for Barangay Bubog and P175,000.00 per hectare for Barangay San Agustin.[34]



The petition lacks merit.
 
Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of Special Agrarian Courts
 
Petitioner availed of the wrong remedy when it directly appealed from the decision of the DARAB to the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. The correct remedy was to file a petition for determination of just compensation with the SAC questioning the Decision of the DARAB as mandated by Sec. 6, Rule XIX[35] of the DARAB Rules of Procedure and Sec. 57[36] of R.A. No. 6657.

Jurisdiction is the court’s authority to hear and determine a case and there are two rules in determining jurisdiction in cases. First, jurisdiction is conferred by law.[37] Second, the nature of the action and the issue of jurisdiction are shaped by the material averments of the complaint and the character of the relief sought.[38]

Under R.A. No. 6657, or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, the DAR has exclusive jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform and is empowered to establish and promulgate operational policies and issue rules and regulations.[39] It is also mandated to acquire and determine the value of private agricultural lands for distribution to qualified beneficiaries.[40] Meanwhile, LBP is charged with the preliminary determination of the value of lands placed under the land reform program and the compensation to be paid for their taking. It initiates the acquisition of agricultural lands by notifying the landowner of the government’s intention to acquire his or her land and the valuation of the same as determined by LBP.[41] Within 30 days from receipt of notice, the landowner shall inform the DAR of his or her acceptance or rejection of the offer. In the event the landowner rejects the offer, a summary administrative proceeding is held by the provincial (PARAD), the regional (RARAD) or the central (DARAB) adjudicator, as the case may be, depending on the value of the land for the purpose of determining the compensation for the land. The landowner, LBP, and other interested parties are then required to submit evidence as to the just compensation for the land. The DAR Adjudicator decides the case within 30 days after it is submitted for decision.[42]

If the landowner finds the price unsatisfactory, it will be the SAC that shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners. The pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 6657, states:

Section 56. Special Agrarian Court. — The Supreme Court shall designate at least one (1) branch of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) within each province to act as a Special Agrarian Court.

The Supreme Court may designate more branches to constitute such additional Special Agrarian Courts as may be necessary to cope with the number of agrarian cases in each province. In the designation, the Supreme Court shall give preference to the Regional Trial Courts which have been assigned to handle agrarian cases or whose presiding judges were former judges of the defunct Court of Agrarian Relations.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) judges assigned to said courts shall exercise said special jurisdiction in addition to the regular jurisdiction of their respective courts.

The Special Agrarian Courts shall have the powers and prerogatives inherent in or belonging to the Regional Trial Courts.

Section 57. Special Jurisdiction. — The Special Agrarian Courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act. x x x (Emphasis supplied).

To implement this provision, Sec. 6 of Rule XIX (Preliminary Determination of Just Compensation) of the DARAB Rules of Procedure provides:

SECTION 6. Filing of Original Action with the Special Agrarian Court for Final Determination. — The party who disagrees with the decision of the Board/Adjudicator may contest the same by filing an original action with the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) having jurisdiction over the subject property within fifteen (15) days from his receipt of the Board/Adjudicator’s decision.

Immediately upon filing with the SAC, the party shall file a Notice of Filing of Original Action with the Board/Adjudicator, together with a certified true copy of the petition filed with the SAC.

Failure to file a Notice of Filing of Original Action or to submit a certified true copy of the petition shall render the decision of the Board/Adjudicator final and executory. Upon receipt of the Notice of Filing of Original Action or certified true copy of the petition filed with the SAC, no writ of execution shall be issued by the Board/Adjudicator.

Clearly, R.A. No. 6657 confers jurisdiction on Regional Trial Courts (RTC) to act as SACs. The SACs have been statutorily determined to have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation due to landowners under the CARP. This legal principle has been upheld and sustained in a number of decisions and has passed into the province of established doctrine in agrarian reform jurisprudence.[43]

In Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco,[44] the Court upheld the RTC’s jurisdiction over the petition for determination of just compensation even when no summary administrative proceedings were held before the DARAB which has primary jurisdiction over the issue. The Court held:

The trial court properly acquired jurisdiction because of its exclusive and original jurisdiction over determination of just compensation, thus –

. . . It is clear from Sec. 57 that the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has “original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners.” This “original and exclusive” jurisdiction of the RTC would be undermined if the DAR would vest in administrative officials original jurisdiction in compensation cases and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions. Thus, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from Sec. 57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into an appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Sec. 57 and therefore would be void. Thus, direct resort to the SAC [Special Agrarian Court] by private respondent is valid.[45] (Italics in the original)

In Land Bank of the Philippines v. Belista,[46] the Court explained:

Clearly, under Section 50, DAR has primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DA and the DENR. Further exception to the DAR’s original and exclusive jurisdiction are all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under RA No. 6657, which are within the jurisdiction of the RTC sitting as a Special Agrarian Court. Thus, jurisdiction on just compensation cases for the taking of lands under RA No. 6657 is vested in the courts.[47]

Finally, in Heirs of Lorenzo and Carmen Vidad v. Land Bank of the Philippines:[48]

It must be emphasized that the taking of property under [R.A.] 6657 is an exercise of the State’s power of eminent domain. The valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies. When the parties cannot agree on the amount of just compensation, only the exercise of judicial power can settle the dispute with binding effect on the winning and losing parties. On the other hand, the determination of just compensation in the RARAD/DARAB requires the voluntary agreement of the parties. Unless the parties agree, there is no settlement of the dispute before the RARAD/DARAB, except if the aggrieved party fails to file a petition for just compensation on time before the RTC.[49] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

It cannot be doubted that one of the principal averments raised by petitioner is the issue of just compensation. Hence, petitioner’s remedy falls squarely on Sec. 57 of R.A. No. 6657, which is to bring the case before the SAC for final determination of the just compensation due.[50] However, instead of following the mandate of R.A. No. 6657, petitioner availed of the wrong remedy when it directly appealed from the decision of the DARAB to the CA under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.

It is here that petitioner asserts that its remedy to appeal with the CA was proper as it also sought to correct the erroneous disposition by the DAR of placing the subject properties under the CARP rather than for simple determination of just compensation.

The Court disagrees.

The following procedural rules are instructive. Rule II, Secs. 7 and 8, in relation to Rule I, Sec. 2, of the 2003 Rules of Procedure for Agrarian Law Implementation[51] (ALI) cases provides:

RULE I
PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS

x x x x
SECTION 2. ALI cases. These Rules shall govern all cases arising from or involving:

2.1. Classification and identification of landholdings for coverage under the agrarian reform program and the initial issuance of Certificate of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs) and Emancipation Patents (EPs), including protests or oppositions thereto and petitions for lifting of such coverage[.]

RULE II
JURISDICTION OVER ALI CASES

SECTION 7. General Jurisdiction. The Regional Director shall exercise primary jurisdiction over all agrarian law implementation cases except when a separate special rule vests primary jurisdiction in a different DAR office.
SECTION 8. Jurisdiction over protests or petitions to lift coverage. The Regional Director shall exercise primary jurisdiction over protests against CARP coverage or petitions to lift notice of coverage. If the ground for the protest or petition to lift CARP coverage is exemption or exclusion of the subject land from CARP coverage, the Regional Director shall either resolve the same if he has jurisdiction, or refer the matter to the Secretary if jurisdiction over the case belongs to the latter.

Evidently, assuming that petitioner was truly objecting the inclusion of the subject properties under the CARP coverage, then the proper remedy is not to appeal with the CA; rather, such matter should have been brought before the Regional Director or the Secretary of the DAR.

In Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. v. Reyes,[52] the Court held that the determination of the land’s classification as agricultural or non-agricultural and, in turn, whether the land falls under agrarian reform exemption, must be preliminarily threshed out before the DAR,[53] particularly, the DAR Secretary, pursuant to DAR Administrative Order (AO) No. 6, Series of 1994. Accordingly, even with petitioner’s insistence that it was merely objecting the inclusion of the subject properties to the CARP coverage, it still availed of the wrong remedy.

Further, the inclusion of additional issues other than just compensation would not divest the SAC of its jurisdiction over petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners. To do so would undermine the jurisdiction conferred to it by law.

In accordance with Sec. 6 of Rule XIX of the DARAB Rules of Procedure, failure on the part of petitioner to file an original action with the SAC to contest the decision of the Board or Adjudicator, renders the decision of DARAB final and executory. The same can no longer be altered, much less reversed, by this Court under the doctrine of immutability of judgments.
 

Subject properties are covered by the CARP
 
In any case, even assuming that the wrong remedy availed of by petitioner may be brushed off, the issue of whether the subject properties should have been excluded from CARP coverage is a factual issue beyond the ambit of this Court. The determination of such issue is best left to the courts or tribunals below, especially the specialized adjudication bodies,[54] such as the DAR.

Time and again, the Court has declared that it is not a trier of facts. The Court’s function in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts or tribunals.[55] It is not this Court’s function to analyze or weigh evidence that have already been considered in the lower courts, or in this case, the proper administrative agencies.[56] Even granting arguendo that petitioner’s case falls under one of the exceptions to said off­-quoted principle, the petition must still fail upon resolution of the substantive issues herein.

The CARP covers the following lands: (1) all alienable and disposable lands of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture; (2) all lands of the public domain exceeding the total area of five hectares and below to be retained by the landowner; (3) all government-owned lands that are devoted to or suitable for agriculture; and (4) all private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture, regardless of the agricultural products raised or can be raised on these lands.[57] Meanwhile, agricultural land is defined as land devoted to agricultural activity and not otherwise classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial, or industrial land.[58]

As to what constitutes an agricultural activity, this is defined by Sec. 3(b) of R.A. No. 6657, as amended, as the cultivation of the soil, planting of crops, growing of fruit trees, raising of livestock, poultry or fish, including the harvesting of such farm products, and other farm activities and practices performed by a farmer in conjunction with such farming operations done by persons whether natural or juridical.[59] In addition, Secs. 10 and 11 of R.A. No. 6657 provide the types of lands that are excluded therefrom:

Section 10. Exemptions and Exclusions. — Lands actually, directly and exclusively used and found to be necessary for parks, wildlife, forest reserves, reforestation, fish sanctuaries and breeding grounds, watersheds, and mangroves, national defense, school sites and campuses including experimental farm stations operated by public or private schools for educational purposes, seeds and seedlings research and pilot production centers, church sites and convents appurtenant thereto, mosque sites and Islamic centers appurtenant thereto, communal burial grounds and cemeteries, penal colonies and penal farms actually worked by the inmates, government and private research and quarantine centers and all lands with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already developed shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.[60] (Emphasis supplied).

Section 11. Commercial Farming. — Commercial farms, which are private agricultural lands devoted to commercial livestock, poultry and swine raising, and aquaculture including saltbeds, fishponds and prawn ponds, fruit farms, orchards, vegetable and cut-flower farms, and cacao, coffee and rubber plantations, shall be subject to immediate compulsory acquisition and distribution after (10) years from the effectivity of this Act. In the case of new farms, the ten-year period shall begin from the first year of commercial production and operation, as determined by the DAR. During the ten-year period, the government shall initiate the steps necessary to acquire these lands, upon payment of just compensation for the land and the improvements thereon, preferably in favor of organized cooperatives or associations, which shall thereafter manage the said lands for the worker-beneficiaries.[61]

When R.A. No. 7881,[62] which amended certain provisions of R.A. No. 6657, was enacted into law, it placed lands used for prawn farms and fishponds as exempt from the coverage of the CARP, to wit:

Sec. 2. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 6657 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Sec. 10. Exemptions and Exclusions.

a) Lands actually, directly and exclusively used for parks, wildlife, forest reserves, reforestation, fish sanctuaries and breeding grounds, watersheds and mangroves shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.

b) Private lands actually, directly[,] and exclusively used for prawn farms and fishponds shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act: Provided, That said prawn farms and fishponds have not been distributed and Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) issued to agrarian reform beneficiaries under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.

While the CARP previously categorized lands devoted to fishponds and prawn farming as agricultural lands subject to the CARP, albeit under a ten-­year deferment period, R.A. No. 7881 wholly decreed lands actually, directly, and exclusively used for prawn farms and fishponds to be exempt from the coverage of the CARP.[63] Not only that, but by virtue of the foregoing amendments, the operation of fishponds is no longer considered an agricultural activity, and a parcel of land devoted to fishpond operation is no longer an agricultural land.[64]

Here, petitioner argues that the subject properties were previously utilized as fishponds and for prawn farming and, therefore, exempt from the coverage of CARP. Petitioner submits in evidence a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to prove that the properties were used for fishponds and prawn farming. The MOA was signed in 1991 by the previous owner of the subject properties, Filipinas Aquaculture Corporation (FAC). Petitioner also submits in evidence the balance sheets of FAC, which showed aquaculture items in its inventory.

The Court is not convinced that the courts and tribunals a quo seriously erred in declaring that the subject properties are covered by the CARP.

At the time the subject properties were evaluated by the DARAB, these were already considered as idle lands. It must be noted that no balance sheets, or any evidence were submitted to show that petitioner continued the use of the subject properties for prawn farming and fishponds when the latter subsequently purchased the subject properties from FAC sometime in 1996.[65] The alleged actual use of the subject properties as evidenced by the financial statements of FAC were issued ten (10) years prior to the conduct of the ocular inspection by the DAR in 1998.[66]

Previous use of the land does not equate to actual use especially when there is no evidence to the contrary. Assuming arguendo that the subject properties were, in the distant past, used for prawn farming and fishponds as purportedly shown in the MOA in 1991, no evidence would suggest that it continued to be so when petitioner bought the subject properties from its previous owner, FAC, and when it was examined by the DAR in 1998. Nor was there evidence that the lands were utilized for aquaculture when the DAR issued the Notice of Coverage to petitioner on August 12, 1998. To reiterate, the field investigation reports conducted on the subject properties revealed that the lands were classified as idle lands and such were planted with rice only in 1999.[67] This affirms that the subject properties were no longer used in aquaculture or prawn farming.

Petitioner further argues that the SB of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro reclassified the subject properties as industrial areas, as evidenced by SB Resolution No. 5403, series of 1995.[68] Being classified an industrial area, it would be outside the scope of agricultural lands covered by CARP.

Again, the Court disagrees.

DAR AO No. 1, Series of 1990, states that for lands to be classified as industrial, it should be approved by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) and its preceding competent authorities. Further, the Local Government Code (LGC), or R.A. No. 7160, gives the Local Government Units (LGU) authority to reclassify agricultural lands for residential, commercial or industrial use. However, in this case, there was no valid reclassification under SB Resolution No. 5403 since the LGC requires an ordinance, not a mere resolution from the local legislative body.[69] Sec. 20, Chapter II, Title I of the LGC ordains:

Section 20. Reclassification of Lands. — (a) A city or municipality may, through an ordinance passed by the sanggunian after conducting public hearings for the purpose, authorize the reclassification of agricultural lands and provide for the manner of their utilization or disposition in the following cases: (1) when the land ceases to be economically feasible and sound for agricultural purposes as determined by the Department of Agriculture or (2) where the land shall have substantially greater economic value for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes, as determined by the sanggunian concerned[.] (Emphasis supplied).

Clearly, an ordinance is required in order to reclassify agricultural lands, and such may be passed only after the conduct of public hearings;[70] it cannot be done through a resolution. In Holy Trinity Realty & Development Corporation v. Dela Cruz,[71] this Court held that a resolution is ineffectual for purposes of reclassifying agricultural lands for a resolution is a mere declaration of the sentiment or opinion of the lawmaking body on a specific matter and is temporary in nature. It differs from an ordinance in that the latter is a law in itself and possesses a general and permanent character.[72]

Verily, in this case, there being no valid reclassification due to the lack of an ordinance, it is clear that a mere resolution could not serve as a basis for exemption of the entirety of the subject properties embraced therein from CARP coverage.[73] As petitioner failed to prove that the subject properties are exempt from the coverage of CARP, no error can be attributed to the common conclusion reached by the DAR and DARAB that the subject properties are covered by the CARP.
 

Just compensation; Applicable formula
 
Finally, with respect to the issue of just compensation, the Court declares that the courts a quo did not seriously err in declaring as final the finding of just compensation regarding the land.

Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator.[74] In determining just compensation, a wide range of factors must be considered in approximating the real and full value of a land.[75] Thus, for purposes of computing just compensation, Sec. 17 of R.A. No. 6657, as amended, states:

Section 17. Determination of Just Compensation. — In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.

Guided by Sec. 17 of R.A. No. 6657, as amended, DAR AO No. 5, series of 1998,[76] that provided a basic formula which gave landowners the opportunity to take part in the valuation process for purposes of obtaining just compensation for their land. Landowners could even participate in the DAR’s field investigations and submit statements as to income derived from the property.[77] However, R.A. No. 9700,[78] or an Act Amending R.A. No. 6657 Re: Extending the Acquisition and Distribution of Agricultural Lands, came into effect on August 7, 2009. The law further amended Sec. 17 of R.A. No. 6657 thus:

SECTION 7. Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:

SEC. 17. Determination of Just Compensation. — In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the value of the standing crop, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, the assessment made by government assessors, and seventy percent (70%) of the zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), translated into a basic formula by the DAR shall be considered, subject to the final decision of the proper court. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation. (Emphases supplied).

It was pursuant to the mandate of R.A. No. 9700 that DAR AO No. 1 (2010)[79] and DAR AO No. 7 (2011)[80] were issued to implement the amendments to Sec. 17. The administrative orders retained the basic formula for valuation under DAR AO No. 5 (1998), however, some factors were adjusted. There was a change in the reckoning date of average gross product and selling price, both of which are relevant to the Capitalized Net Income (CNI) factor, to June 30, 2009. The Comparable Sales (CS) factor was also amended and adjusted to the fair market value equivalent to seventy percent (70%) of the BIR zonal valuation. The basic formula under DAR AO No. 7 (2011) is the prevailing land formula to date.

However, even with the enactment of R.A. No. 9700, the law explicitly states that the completion and final resolution of all previously acquired lands wherein valuation is subject to challenge by the landowners shall still be made pursuant to Sec. 17 of R.A. No. 6657.[81] In addition, the DAR issued AO No. 2, Series of 2009,[82] to clarify the coverage of the amendments introduced by R.A. No. 9700. The transitory provision of DAR AO No. 02-09 provides that “with respect to land valuation, all Claim Folders received by LBP prior to July 1, 2009 shall be valued in accordance with Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 prior to its amendment by R.A. No. 9700.” This has been recognized in several cases, such as the recent case of Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Cortez,[83] wherein this Court ruled:

We have recognized and upheld the foregoing provision and ruled that lands where the claim folders were received by LBP prior to July 1, 2009 shall be valued in accordance with Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 prior to its further amendment by R.A. No. 9700, and thus will be governed by the applicable DAR issuance.[84]

Additionally, in Land Bank of the Philippines v. Kho[85] (Kho), this Court held:

However, it bears pointing out that while Congress passed RA 9700 on August 7, 2009, further amending certain provisions of RA 6657, as amended, among them, Section 17, and declaring “[t]hat all previously acquired lands wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners shall be completed and finally resolved pursuant to Section 17 of [RA 6657], as amended,” DAR AO 2, series of 2009, which is the implementing rules of RA 9700, had clarified that the said law shall not apply to claims/cases where the claim folders were received by LBP prior to July 1, 2009. In such a situation, just compensation shall be determined in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, prior to its further amendment by RA 9700.

x x x x

It is significant to stress, however, that DAR AO 1, series of 2010 which was issued in line with Section 31 of RA 9700 empowering the DAR to provide the necessary rules and regulations for its implementation, became effective only subsequent to July 1, 2009. Consequently, it cannot be applied in the determination of just compensation for the subject land where the claim folders were undisputedly received by the LBP prior to July 1, 2009, and, as such, should be valued in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657 prior to its further amendment by RA 9700 pursuant to the cut-off date set under DAR AO 2, series of2009 (cut-off rule). Notably, DAR AO 1, series of 2010 did not expressly or impliedly repeal the cut-off rule set under DAR AO 2, series of 2009, having made no reference to any cut-off date with respect to land valuation for previously acquired lands under PD 27 and EO 228 wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners. Consequently, the application of DAR AO 1, series of 2010 should be, thus, limited to those where the claim folders were received on or subsequent to July 1, 2009.[86]

In applying the foregoing cases, it is to be noted that DAR AO No. 7 (2011), which was issued to revise and streamline DAR AO No. 2 (2009),[87] also makes no mention of repealing the cut-off rule mentioned in Kho. There is also no dispute that the present case is well within the ambit of R.A. No. 6657 and DAR AO No. 5 (1998) and, consequently, beyond the scope and applicability of the amendments introduced by R.A. No. 9700 and DAR guidelines issued in relation thereto.

Thus, in Alfonso v. Land Bank of the Philippines[88] (Alfonso), this Court settled the mandatory application of the guidelines and formula prescribed by the DAR. Nevertheless, in the same case, it was recognized that the trial courts may deviate from a strict application of the formula, provided that such departure is supported by a reasoned explanation grounded on the evidence on record.[89] Notably, in this case, there is no reason to deviate from the application of the established formula for the computation of just compensation.

Upon review of the records of the case, the procedure with which the subject properties were brought into the coverage of CARP were all in order. Further, the LBP, which is charged with the preliminary determination of the value of lands placed under the land reform program and the compensation to be paid for the taking,[90] followed DAR AO No. 5 (1998) which contained the basic formula for the computation of just compensation under Sec. 17 of R.A. No. 6657 at the time.[91] In this case, the DAR and LBP valued the subject lands as P11,648,130.73 and P7,882,623.22, respectively.

The data and factors used in the computation by the LBP regarding the just compensation of the disputed lands included the tax declarations of the subject properties, the schedule unit market value applicable for the municipality of the subject properties, land use production value, and actual use per ocular inspections and field investigations.[92] As Capitalized Net Income (CNI) and Comparable Sales factor (CS) were not present, the LBP used the formula Land Value (LV) = Market Value (MV) x 2 or (LV = MV x 2).[93] This is in accordance with DAR AO No. 5, (1998) (Item II, A.3), which states:

II. The following rules and regulations are hereby promulgated to govern the valuation of lands subject of acquisition whether under voluntary offer to sell (VOS) or compulsory acquisition (CA).

A. There shall be one basic formula for the valuation of lands covered by VOS or CA:

LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)

Where: LV  = Land Value
            CNI = Capitalized Net Income
            CS   = Comparable Sales
            MV = Market Value per Tax Declaration

The above formula shall be used if all the three factors are present, relevant, and applicable.

x x x x

A.3 When both the CS and CNI are not present and only MV is applicable, the formula shall be:

LV = MV x 2

In no case shall the value of idle land using the formula MV x 2 exceed the lowest value of land within the same estate under consideration or within the same barangay or municipality (in that order) approved by LBP within one (1) year from receipt of claimholder.

As held in Alfonso, an examination of the terms of the DAR issuances would show that the implementing agency had indeed taken pains to ensure that its valuation system was at par with local and international valuation standards. The whole regulatory scheme provided under R.A. No. 6657, implemented through the DAR formulas, are reasonable policy choices made by Congress and implemented by the DAR in accordance with the purposes of the CARP. These policy choices, in the absence of contrary evidence, deserve a high degree of deference from the Court.[94]

Lastly, petitioner contends that the actual value and valuations made by the independent appraisers were disregarded by LBP and DARAB. Not only that, petitioner claims that the latter also failed to consider the improvements introduced on the subject properties, such as the roads, waterways, water reverse and facilities.[95]

The Court is not convinced. Contrary to petitioner’s claims, the DARAB Decision set forth:

Thus, on the issue as to the compensability of the improvements introduced by the landowner, such as the roads which are now considered as farm to market roads; waterways, used to irrigate the land for the portion of the property classified as irrigated rice land; water reserve used to store water during the summer season or as the need arises; and dikes to protect the land from flooding, the said improvements, must necessarily be included in the compensation package for the landowner.

x x x x

However, as to the valuation on just compensation of the CARP­-covered landholdings embraced by TCT Nos. [T-]13682 and T-13683 with an area of 356.9948 hectares and 89.7367 hectares, respectively, the landowner failed to support by clear and convincing evidence said valuation. Marken, Inc. did not present evidence, documentary or otherwise that would overcome the presumption of regularity enjoyed by the personnel of the LBP.

x x x x

Further, the actual use of the property as evidenced by the Financial Statements of Filipinas Aquaculture Corporation, ten years (1988-1990) before the conduct of the ocular inspection in 1998 (for TCT [No. T-]13682) and 2000 (for TCT No. T-13683) cannot be a valid basis for the computation of the value of the property nor can RA 7881 be used as a reason for exemption since when the subject landholdings were placed under the coverage of RA 6657, as amended, the use of the property was no longer as prawn farm nor as a fishpond. In fact, the Field Investigation Reports conducted on the parcels of land on September 22, 1998 for TCT No. T-13682 and on June 28, 2000, for TCT No. T-13683 revealed that the landholdings were classified as idle lands and were planted to riceland only in 1999, which findings are in consonance with the Order of Deferment describing the remaining portion consisting of 448 hectares as idle land as well as the order lifting the order of deferment on the ground that its basis for deferment is no longer applicable.

Thus, the Financial Statements as of 1988-1989; 1989-1990 were not reflective of the actual, current and fair market value of the property as mandated by DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 and neither was the Market Value Appraisal for the Property of Marken, Inc. as of January 5, 2007 of Cuervo Appraisers. In short, the landowner failed to submit input data in order to convince the Board that the valuations of the parcels of land were not in accordance with law, existing rules and regulation and jurisprudential precedents.

WHEREFORE, ORDER is hereby issued:

x x x x

2. Directing the LBP to recompute the additional compensation package for the necessary improvements which redounded to the benefit of the farmer-beneficiaries[.][96]

Thus, it is clear that the valuations of the subject properties were based on reliable data gathered by the DAR and the LBP pursuant to the provisions of DAR AO No. 5, series of 1998, and as contained in the Field Investigation Report. Further, contrary to petitioner’s contentions, the DARAB Decision took into consideration the improvements that redounded to the benefit of the farmer-beneficiaries, despite the fact that no other data or supporting documents were submitted by petitioner to the DARAB regarding the actual and current use of the subject lands.

As stated above, the DARAB recognized that there were Financial Statements of FAC, the previous owner, from 1988 to 1990 covering the subject properties. However, at the time that the subject properties were covered by CARP in 1998, ten (10) years had already passed. The Field Investigation Reports conducted on the subject properties from 1998 to 2000 by the DAR revealed that the landholdings were classified as idle lands and were planted with rice only in 1999. These findings are in consonance with the cancellation of the Order of Deferment because the remaining portions of the subject properties consisting of 448 hectares were considered idle land, hence, covered by CARP. Evidently, the Financial Statements of FAC from 1988 to 1990 do not reflect the actual use and valuation of the subject properties; rather, it is the factual and genuine investigation conducted by the DAR over the lands, which showed them to be idle lands, that should prevail. As these are idle lands, the lower valuation given by the courts and tribunals a quo shall prevail.

In light of the foregoing, the Court sustains the findings of the DAR and the LBP. To reiterate, the Court generally defers and accords finality to the factual findings of administrative agencies, such as the DAR, as a matter of sound practice and procedure. These findings are deemed binding and conclusive upon this Court as administrative agencies possessing special knowledge and expertise on “matters falling under their specialized jurisdiction.”[97] Sec. 54 of R.A. No. 6657 and Rule XV, Sec. 2 of the 2009 DARAB Rules of Procedure, state:

SECTION 54. [R.A. No. 6657] x x x

The findings of fact of the DAR shall be final and conclusive if based on substantial evidence.

Rule XV
Judicial Review

SECTION 2. [DARAB New Rules of Procedure] Findings of Fact; Final and Conclusive. — The findings of fact of the Board, if based on substantial evidence, shall be final and conclusive upon the courts pursuant to Section 54, Republic Act No. 6657.
This Court then sees no reason to disturb the factual findings of the DARAB. Such findings, when supported by substantial evidence, are accorded great respect and even finality.[98]

WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The April 24, 2015 Decision and October 1, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 127071, as well as the September 5, 2011 Decision and September 13, 2012 Resolution of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board in DARAB Case No. JC-IV-0330-OCC-MDO-CO-02 are AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.

Hernando, Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","Marken, Incorporated (petitioner), now known as Aquasalina Incorporated, owned two parcels of land in Occidental Mindoro covered by TCT Nos. T-13682 and T-13683. On August 12, 1998, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) sent a Notice of Coverage placing these properties under the Compulsory Acquisition Scheme of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) valued the properties and prepared compensation based on this valuation. However, the petitioner rejected this valuation, leading to summary administrative proceedings before the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB) to fix just compensation.","Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari essentially raising the following:
Whether the CA erred when it failed to consider that the petition filed before it was to seek redress for the erroneous disposition by the DAR on placing the subject properties under the CARP of the government;
Whether the CA erred when it failed to consider that the “just compensation” for the subject properties should be based on their classification as prawn and fishpond and not agricultural land.
Petitioner argues that its appeal to the CA was primarily to seek redress for the correction of the erroneous disposition by the DAR of placing the subject properties under the CARP rather than for simple determination of just compensation. The subject properties were undisputed by public respondents to have been previously utilized in salt production, and later as fishponds and for prawn farming. It avers that under R.A. No. 6657, fishponds and prawn farms were categorized as commercial farms eligible for a ten-year deferment period and that a Deferment Order was issued in favor of its predecessor-in­-interest effective 1988 to 1998. While under this deferment period, R.A. No. 7881[22] was enacted, expressly exempting fishponds and prawn farms from its coverage. Petitioner also adds that in 1995, the subject properties were re-zoned as an industrial area under Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Resolution No. 5403. It points out that DAR had cancelled said Order of Deferment despite the foregoing exemptions, but the DARAB made no determination on such issue.[23] It insists that the just compensation for the subject properties should be based on their classification as prawn farms and fishponds and not as agricultural land. Finally, petitioner contends that the LBP failed to consider the value of the improvements introduced on the subject properties by their previous owners in the determination of just compensation.","The DARAB adopted the valuation by LBP and ruled that the landowner failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to support a higher valuation. The CA upheld the DARAB's decision, dismissing the petition for lack of merit and affirming the compensation determined by the LBP and DARAB.

In its ruling, the CA noted that the petitioner should have filed a petition with the Special Agrarian Court for determination of just compensation, as mandated by law, instead of appealing to the CA. This procedural misstep rendered the DARAB's decision final and executory. The CA and DARAB held that the properties were correctly valued based on their status as agricultural land, considering factors outlined in existing agrarian laws."

The RRT recommended conducting a validation of the decision-making process of the IPs and to secure the FPIC of the IP communities of the indirectly affected areas.

On February 28, 2011, the NCIP Chairperson constituted a Validation Team to investigate the conduct of the FPIC process. The Validation Team recommended the issuance of the Certification Precondition. Despite these recommendations, the NCIP En Banc issued Resolution No. 001-2012, denying the issuance of a Certification Precondition, mainly on the ground that a separate FBI is required on the two indirectly affected barangays, namely Barangay Aribungos and Barong-barong. Macroasia Corporation moved for reconsideration, but NCIP denied it on February 23, 2012.

Macroasia Corporation then elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals by way of a petition for review. On March 14, 2016, the Court of Appeals issued an Amended Decision directing the NCIP to issue a Certification Precondition in favor of Macroasia Corporation. The NCIP moved for reconsideration of the CA Decision but was denied in a Resolution dated August 9, 2016. Consequently, NCIP filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari with the Supreme Court.

Further complicating the issue, on June 7, 2019, Macroasia Corporation assigned all its rights, titles, interests, and obligations under MPSA Nos. 220-2005-IVB to Macroasia Mining. Subsequently, the Secretary of the DENR issued an Order on February 1, 2021, approving the assignment. As the lawful assignee, Macroasia Mining initiated the FPIC process regarding Barangay Aribungos and Barong-Barong, culminating in the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement with the IP leaders of the indirectly affected barangays.

Ultimately, Macroasia Mining, authorized by Macroasia Corporation, met with NCIP and agreed to settle the case amicably, bypassing the need for a full-blown trial​","The Court of Appeals initially ruled in favor of Macroasia Corporation, directing NCIP to issue the Certification Precondition.
NCIP's motion for reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals.
The Supreme Court approved the Compromise Agreement and ordered the dismissal of the case with prejudice.
The Compromise Agreement was deemed valid and binding, closing and terminating the case."

JOENAR VARGAS AGRAVANTE, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT OF GOA, CAMARINES SUR, AND JOSEPH AMATA BLANCE, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



GESMUNDO, C.J.:
This is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, with an urgent prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or preliminary injunction filed by Joenar Vargas Agravante (petitioner), assailing the July 2, 2019 Order[2] of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) First Division (COMELEC Division) and the September 20, 2022 Resolution[3] of the COMELEC En Banc in EAC No. 167-2018-B.


Petitioner and Joseph Amata Blance (private respondent) were candidates for the position of Punong Barangay of Matacla, Goa, Camarines Sur, in the May 14, 2018 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE). Private respondent garnered 786 votes, while petitioner got 789 votes, the latter winning by a margin of three votes. Thus, petitioner was proclaimed the duly elected Punong Barangay of Matacla on May 15, 2018.[4]
Not satisfied with the election result, private respondent filed a protest on May 23, 2018 before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Goa, Camarines Sur. On May 30, 2018, petitioner filed an Answer with Counterclaim and with Affirmative Defenses which are Grounds for a Motion to Dismiss and with Counter-Protest. Private respondent subsequently filed his Answer to Counterclaim/Counter-Protest on June 6, 2018.[5]

After the issues were joined and due course given to the protest and counter-protest, a preliminary conference was held on June 25, 2018 whereby a revision committee was constituted. In said conference, the parties agreed that after revision, they will simultaneously make their formal offer of documentary evidence together with their memoranda with the end in view of expediting the resolution of the case. Thereafter, the case shall be decided on the basis of the memoranda, if any, revision reports, evidence so marked and offered, and other pleadings forming part of the record.[6]



On October 15, 2018, the MTC promulgated its Decision[7] granting the protest, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the proclamation of Joenar V. Agravante as the winning candidate is hereby SET ASIDE and Joseph A. Blance is hereby DECLARED as the elected Punong Barangay of Matacla, Goa, Camarines Sur in the May 14, 2018 BSKE.

Costs against the Protestee.

SO ORDERED.[8]

According to the MTC, Section 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC provides that no evidence shall be considered by the court unless it has been formally offered.[9] On the basis of this provision, the MTC excluded from the official count a certain number of ballots that were not formally offered in evidence by either petitioner or private respondent.[10] Thus, after the revision of the ballots, the MTC held that private respondent obtained 789 votes as against petitioner who received 784 votes, the former winning by a margin of five votes.[11]

Aggrieved, petitioner appealed to the COMELEC.


On July 2, 2019, the COMELEC Division issued an Order, the fallo of which reads:
Accordingly, the Commission (First Division) RESOLVED as it hereby RESOLVES to DISMISS the instant appeal for appellant’s failure to submit his Brief within the prescribed period pursuant to Section 9 (b), Rule 22 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended.

SO ORDERED.[12]

According to the COMELEC Division, based on petitioner’s brief, he furnished the same to private respondent through registered mail. However, petitioner failed to submit an affidavit of mailing, the registry receipt as proof of service, and a written explanation as to why service by mail was resorted to in accordance with Secs. 11 and 13, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, in relation to Sec. 3, Rule 12 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended.[13] Thus, petitioner’s brief was deemed not filed for failure to comply with the said mandatory requirements.[14]

Dissatisfied with the said Order, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[15]



On September 20, 2022, the COMELEC En Banc issued the assailed Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the Commission hereby RESOLVES to DENY the instant Motion for Reconsideration. Accordingly, the Order promulgated by the Commission (First Division) on 02 July 2019 is hereby AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[16]

The COMELEC En Banc found no reason to reverse the ruling of the COMELEC Division, holding that petitioner failed to present any controverting evidence to justify his noncompliance with the rules and merely stated that his failure was only due to inadvertence. Considering that the submission of documentary requirements is mandatory in nature and noncompliance is a clear ground for dismissal, the COMELEC En Banc held that the motion for reconsideration failed to raise new issues and substantial matters that would warrant the reversal of the assailed Order.[17]

Hence, this Petition.



Petitioner argues that the COMELEC En Banc acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it dismissed his appeal outright based on technical grounds. He argues that he immediately rectified his procedural lapse by promptly filing a motion for reconsideration and attaching the following: 1) affidavit of service and explanation of service by registered mail, 2) certification from the Provincial Capitol Complex Post Office of the fact of mailing, and 3) copies of the registry receipts. Despite his substantial compliance, the COMELEC En Banc still denied his motion without taking into account the importance of the issues raised and the prima facie merit of his brief.[18]
Moreover, petitioner argues that he is the real winner of the 2018 BSKE with a winning margin of at least seven votes. In fact, even the MTC itself acknowledged the fact that if the ballots that were not formally offered were to be considered, the outcome of the revision might change in his favor.[19] According to petitioner, the said ballots were marked as exhibits by the Revision Committee, attached to the records of the election protest, and listed in the revision report.[20]

Petitioner also pointed out that the COMELEC has already issued a certificate of finality and entry of judgment on October 26, 2022, even though he received the assailed Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc only on October 18, 2022. Thus, unless a TRO and/or a status quo ante order is issued by this Court, the Decision of the MTC and the Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc may be implemented anytime to the great detriment of the people of Barangay Matacla.[21]

In its Comment,[22] respondent COMELEC, through the Office of the Solicitor General, argues that it did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner’s appeal due to the latter’s failure to perfect the said appeal in accordance with law.[23] The COMELEC emphasized that petitioner merely offered flimsy excuses for his noncompliance with the rules and asked for liberality as if it were a right he is entitled to.[24]

According to the COMELEC, the required documents specified in the COMELEC Division’s Order are mandatory, and petitioner’s noncompliance therewith is a valid reason for the dismissal of his appeal. In addition, petitioner failed to provide any evidence to excuse his noncompliance with the rules when he filed a motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC En Banc.[25] The COMELEC also argues that petitioner is not entitled to injunctive relief for failing to establish the necessary requisites for its issuance.[26] Thus, the COMELEC prays that the petition be dismissed similar to this Court’s ruling in the recent case of Coro v. Commission on Elections[27] (Coro).

In his Reply,[28] petitioner argues that there is compelling reason for this Court to exercise its certiorari jurisdiction on the ground of his substantial compliance with the rules.[29] He also argues that the instant case warrants relaxation or liberality in the application of the rules in the interest of substantial justice.[30] Furthermore, petitioner is of the opinion that the case of Coro is not on all fours with the instant case.[31] Aside from his substantial compliance with the rules, petitioner invokes the 1958 case of Reforma v. De Luna[32] (Reforma), where this Court held that the lower court erred in not examining certain ballots for the sole reason that they were not formally presented as evidence.[33]


I.

WHETHER THE COMELEC EN BANC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DISMISSING PETITIONER’S APPEAL DUE TO THE LATTER’S FAILURE TO PERFECT THE APPEAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.
II.

WHETHER PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO A TRO, STATUS QUO ANTE ORDER, OR A WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.


The scope of this Court’s jurisdiction in a petition for certiorari under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, is limited; the petition must show that the COMELEC En Banc acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[34]
Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as a whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law.[35] In the process of determining the existence of grave abuse of discretion, this Court looks into: (1) whether the act involved was done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence; or (2) whether it was executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily out of malice, ill will or personal bias.[36] Additionally, mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.[37] Unless it is firmly established that the COMELEC En Banc committed grave abuse of discretion, this Court would not interfere with its decision.[38]

In this case, the COMELEC En Banc did not commit abuse of discretion, much less grave abuse of discretion, when it dismissed petitioner’s appeal considering that its September 20, 2022 Resolution is duly supported by law and the records of the case.

It is undisputed that when petitioner was required by the COMELEC Division to file his brief, he failed to submit an affidavit of mailing, the registry receipt as proof of service, and a written explanation as to why service by mail was resorted to. Given that these are mandatory requirements under Secs. 11[39] and 13,[40] Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, in relation to Sec. 3,[41] Rule 12 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended, the COMELEC Division considered petitioner’s brief as not filed. Consequently, it dismissed petitioner’s appeal for his failure to submit his brief within the prescribed period, pursuant to Sec. 9(b),[42] Rule 22 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.

When petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC En Banc, the latter denied the motion since petitioner failed to justify his noncompliance with the rules and failed to raise new issues or substantial matters that would warrant reversal of the COMELEC Division’s Order. The COMELEC En Banc cited Sec. 1, Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, which provides that “[a] motion for reconsideration may be filed on the grounds that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision, order or ruling; or that the said decision, order or ruling is contrary to law.” Considering that petitioner was unable to show the existence of either ground, and merely argued that his failure to comply with the rules should not automatically result in the dismissal of his appeal, the COMELEC En Banc denied his motion.

Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the COMELEC Division and the COMELEC En Banc acted in full conformity with applicable laws, rules, and jurisprudence without any hint of whimsicality, arbitrariness, or capriciousness. Their strict adherence to the rules cannot be deemed grave abuse of discretion nor even mere abuse of discretion. In fact, it is the inverse that holds true; the manifest disregard of basic rules and procedures is precisely what constitutes grave abuse of discretion.[43] Time and again, this Court has held that procedural rules are tools designed to facilitate adjudication of cases, deliberately set in place to prevent arbitrariness in the administration of justice.[44] Since the right to appeal is not a constitutional right but a mere statutory privilege, anyone who seeks to invoke such privilege must comply with the applicable rules; otherwise, the right to appeal is forfeited.[45]

While petitioner does not deny his procedural lapses, he argues that the COMELEC En Banc should have afforded him liberality considering his substantial compliance with the rules and the prima facie merit of his brief. However, it must be recalled that the relaxation of procedural rules cannot be made without any valid reasons to support it.[46] Any party seeking a liberal application of the rules is required to present strong and compelling reasons to warrant the suspension of the rules.[47] To merit liberality, petitioner must show that there is reasonable cause justifying his noncompliance with the rules and that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of substantive justice.[48]

As this Court held in National Grid Corporation of the Philippines v. Bautista:[49]

Liberality in the application of the rules is not an end in itself. It must be pleaded with factual basis and must be allowed for equitable ends. There must be no indication that the violation of the rule is due to negligence or design. Liberality is an extreme exception, justifiable only when equity exists.

Here, petitioner failed to show any reasonable cause justifying his noncompliance with the rules. Petitioner’s explanation that his noncompliance was due to mere inadvertence cannot, in any degree, be considered as reasonable cause that would justify the suspension of the rules. In fact, his failure to provide an acceptable explanation for such noncompliance only highlights his complete disregard of procedural rules, further precluding any justification for their liberal application. Thus, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the COMELEC En Banc for dismissing petitioner’s appeal.

Furthermore, even if the procedural errors committed by petitioner were set aside, the petition remains bereft of merit.

Petitioner argues that the MTC erred in not considering the ballots that he failed to formally offer in evidence,[50] citing Reforma, where the Court held that it was erroneous for the lower court to not examine certain ballots “for the sole reason that they were not formally presented as evidence.”[51] However, with the advent of the 1987 Constitution and the adoption of new rules, the case cited by petitioner can no longer be squarely applied to the instant case.

To recall, Reforma was resolved based on the provisions of Republic Act No. 180, also known as the Revised Election Code, which was the applicable law during that time. The Court therein observed that the Revised Election Code did not provide for any particular procedure for the disposition of election cases once the issues are joined, and that the Rules of Court shall not apply to election cases except by analogy or in a suppletory manner. On the other hand, the MTC herein resolved the present case by applying A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC.[52] Sec. 2, Rule 13 of the said rules provides:

Section 2. Offer of Evidence. — The court shall consider no evidence that has not been formally offered. Offer of evidence shall be done orally on the last day of hearing allowed for each party after the presentation of the last witness. The opposing pai1y shall be required to immediately interpose objections thereto. The court shall rule on the offer of evidence in open court. However, the court may, at its discretion, allow the party to make an offer of evidence in writing, which shall be submitted within three days. If the court rejects any evidence offered, the party may make a tender of the excluded evidence. (Emphasis supplied)

The provision is clear and requires no further interpretation; if any piece of evidence was not formally offered by the parties, then such evidence cannot be considered by the court. In this case, petitioner himself admitted that he failed to offer in evidence 12 ballots due to his own inadve1ience.[53] Pursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, the MTC was proscribed from considering the ballots that were not formally offered by petitioner in resolving the case. It bears to emphasize that A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC was promulgated on May 3, 2007 by none other than this Court pursuant to its exclusive and expanded rule-making power under the 1987 Constitution. This strengthened rule-making power was discussed in Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice:[54]

The 1987 Constitution molded an even stronger and more independent judiciary. Among others, it enhanced the rule[-]making power of this Court. Its Sec. 5(5), Article VIII provides:

[x x x x]

Section 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:

[x x x x]

(5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court.

The rule[-]making power of this Court was expanded. This Court for the first time was given the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. The Court was also granted for the first time the power to disapprove rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies. But most importantly, the 1987 Constitution took away the power of Congress to repeal, alter, or supplement rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure. In fine, the power to promulgate rules of pleading, practice and procedure is no longer shared by this Court with Congress, more so with the Executive.[55] (Italics omitted)

The 1987 Constitution did not patently strengthen the exclusive rule-­making power of the Court only for the Court itself to neglect it.[56] Rules are promulgated for the benefit of all, and the Court is duty-bound to follow them and observe the noble purpose for their issuance.[57] Given the applicability and the unequivocal nature of Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, as well as petitioner’s failure to justify his noncompliance with the pertinent rules, it is not only proper but crucial, for this Court to apply the said provision. As the highest court of the land, this Court is mandated to firmly enforce its own rules in order to preserve the integrity of the judicial system and to maintain impartiality in the administration of justice. Otherwise, the fundamental principle of fairness upon which our legal system is built would be rendered meaningless.

In addition, the rule on formal offer of evidence is by no means merely technical. The rule on formal offer of evidence is intertwined with the constitutional guarantee of due process since the parties must be given the opportunity to review the evidence submitted against them and take the necessary actions to secure their case.[58] As laid down in Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, after the formal offer of evidence of a party, the opposing party is required to immediately interpose his or her objections. Afterwards, the court rules on the formal offer of evidence. Without such formal offer, the opposing party is effectively deprived of the opportunity to object. Thus, the MTC committed no error in its judgment and it properly acknowledged that its hands were tied by the rules when it stated that it could not consider the evidence not formally offered by petitioner.[59]

Neither is the Court swayed by petitioner’s insistence that he was the true winner of the 2018 BSKE. Petitioner relies heavily on the MTC’s statement that the excluded ballots may have changed the results of the revision. Such pronouncement is obiter dictum at best, and highly speculative at worst. The trial court cannot, without crossing into the realm of prejudgment, make an appreciation of ballots not properly admitted into evidence. Furthermore, the MTC uniformly and correctly excluded all ballots not formally offered. Notably, there were seven other ballots being contested and/or claimed by private respondent that were likewise excluded from the revision of ballots for the same reason.

To summarize, petitioner failed to comply with Secs. 11 and 13 of the Rules of Court, in relation to Sec. 3, Rule 12 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended, as well as Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC. Further, petitioner failed to justify his noncompliance with the rules. If this Court were to extend liberality to petitioner despite his unjustified disregard of the rules, it would directly be taking part in undermining the rule of law and the public’s trust in the judicial system by promoting arbitrariness in the enforcement of procedural rules.

While it has been held in previous cases that “[t]echnicalities and procedural niceties in election cases should not be made to stand in the way of the true will of the electorate,”[60] such pronouncement cannot be construed as a license for parties in election cases to disregard procedural rules altogether. This Court never intended to establish the precedent that the “true will of the electorate” may be used as an excuse for all kinds of procedural errors, no matter how numerous or serious they may be. Noncompliance with the rules of procedure in election cases cannot be justified by the mere invocation of the determination of the “true will of the electorate,” and neither is the liberal application of the rules automatically be granted by such invocation. To rule otherwise would be akin to holding that the technical rules of procedure need not be followed in election cases.

It must be emphasized that rules of procedure are intended to ensure the orderly administration of justice and the protection of substantive rights in judicial and extrajudicial proceedings.[61] It is a mistake to suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to each other, or as has often been suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it will result in prejudice to the substantive rights of the litigants.[62] The actual policy of the courts is to give effect to both, as complementing each other, in the just and speedy resolution of the dispute between the parties. Observance of both substantive rights is equally guaranteed by due process, whatever the source of such rights may be.[63]

Given that the dismissal of the instant petition is warranted, petitioner’s prayer for the issuance of a TRO and/or preliminary injunction need not be discussed.

WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The July 2, 2019 Order of the Commission on Elections First Division and the September 20, 2022 Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc in EAC No. 167-2018-B are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner’s urgent prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or status quo ante order and/or preliminary injunction is accordingly DENIED.

SO ORDERED.

Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as a whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law.[35] In the process of determining the existence of grave abuse of discretion, this Court looks into: (1) whether the act involved was done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence; or (2) whether it was executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily out of malice, ill will or personal bias.[36] Additionally, mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.[37] Unless it is firmly established that the COMELEC En Banc committed grave abuse of discretion, this Court would not interfere with its decision.[38]

In this case, the COMELEC En Banc did not commit abuse of discretion, much less grave abuse of discretion, when it dismissed petitioner’s appeal considering that its September 20, 2022 Resolution is duly supported by law and the records of the case.

It is undisputed that when petitioner was required by the COMELEC Division to file his brief, he failed to submit an affidavit of mailing, the registry receipt as proof of service, and a written explanation as to why service by mail was resorted to. Given that these are mandatory requirements under Secs. 11[39] and 13,[40] Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, in relation to Sec. 3,[41] Rule 12 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended, the COMELEC Division considered petitioner’s brief as not filed. Consequently, it dismissed petitioner’s appeal for his failure to submit his brief within the prescribed period, pursuant to Sec. 9(b),[42] Rule 22 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.

When petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC En Banc, the latter denied the motion since petitioner failed to justify his noncompliance with the rules and failed to raise new issues or substantial matters that would warrant reversal of the COMELEC Division’s Order. The COMELEC En Banc cited Sec. 1, Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, which provides that “[a] motion for reconsideration may be filed on the grounds that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision, order or ruling; or that the said decision, order or ruling is contrary to law.” Considering that petitioner was unable to show the existence of either ground, and merely argued that his failure to comply with the rules should not automatically result in the dismissal of his appeal, the COMELEC En Banc denied his motion.

Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the COMELEC Division and the COMELEC En Banc acted in full conformity with applicable laws, rules, and jurisprudence without any hint of whimsicality, arbitrariness, or capriciousness. Their strict adherence to the rules cannot be deemed grave abuse of discretion nor even mere abuse of discretion. In fact, it is the inverse that holds true; the manifest disregard of basic rules and procedures is precisely what constitutes grave abuse of discretion.[43] Time and again, this Court has held that procedural rules are tools designed to facilitate adjudication of cases, deliberately set in place to prevent arbitrariness in the administration of justice.[44] Since the right to appeal is not a constitutional right but a mere statutory privilege, anyone who seeks to invoke such privilege must comply with the applicable rules; otherwise, the right to appeal is forfeited.[45]

While petitioner does not deny his procedural lapses, he argues that the COMELEC En Banc should have afforded him liberality considering his substantial compliance with the rules and the prima facie merit of his brief. However, it must be recalled that the relaxation of procedural rules cannot be made without any valid reasons to support it.[46] Any party seeking a liberal application of the rules is required to present strong and compelling reasons to warrant the suspension of the rules.[47] To merit liberality, petitioner must show that there is reasonable cause justifying his noncompliance with the rules and that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of substantive justice.[48]

As this Court held in National Grid Corporation of the Philippines v. Bautista:[49]

Liberality in the application of the rules is not an end in itself. It must be pleaded with factual basis and must be allowed for equitable ends. There must be no indication that the violation of the rule is due to negligence or design. Liberality is an extreme exception, justifiable only when equity exists.

Here, petitioner failed to show any reasonable cause justifying his noncompliance with the rules. Petitioner’s explanation that his noncompliance was due to mere inadvertence cannot, in any degree, be considered as reasonable cause that would justify the suspension of the rules. In fact, his failure to provide an acceptable explanation for such noncompliance only highlights his complete disregard of procedural rules, further precluding any justification for their liberal application. Thus, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the COMELEC En Banc for dismissing petitioner’s appeal.

Furthermore, even if the procedural errors committed by petitioner were set aside, the petition remains bereft of merit.

Petitioner argues that the MTC erred in not considering the ballots that he failed to formally offer in evidence,[50] citing Reforma, where the Court held that it was erroneous for the lower court to not examine certain ballots “for the sole reason that they were not formally presented as evidence.”[51] However, with the advent of the 1987 Constitution and the adoption of new rules, the case cited by petitioner can no longer be squarely applied to the instant case.

To recall, Reforma was resolved based on the provisions of Republic Act No. 180, also known as the Revised Election Code, which was the applicable law during that time. The Court therein observed that the Revised Election Code did not provide for any particular procedure for the disposition of election cases once the issues are joined, and that the Rules of Court shall not apply to election cases except by analogy or in a suppletory manner. On the other hand, the MTC herein resolved the present case by applying A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC.[52] Sec. 2, Rule 13 of the said rules provides:

Section 2. Offer of Evidence. — The court shall consider no evidence that has not been formally offered. Offer of evidence shall be done orally on the last day of hearing allowed for each party after the presentation of the last witness. The opposing pai1y shall be required to immediately interpose objections thereto. The court shall rule on the offer of evidence in open court. However, the court may, at its discretion, allow the party to make an offer of evidence in writing, which shall be submitted within three days. If the court rejects any evidence offered, the party may make a tender of the excluded evidence. (Emphasis supplied)

The provision is clear and requires no further interpretation; if any piece of evidence was not formally offered by the parties, then such evidence cannot be considered by the court. In this case, petitioner himself admitted that he failed to offer in evidence 12 ballots due to his own inadve1ience.[53] Pursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, the MTC was proscribed from considering the ballots that were not formally offered by petitioner in resolving the case. It bears to emphasize that A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC was promulgated on May 3, 2007 by none other than this Court pursuant to its exclusive and expanded rule-making power under the 1987 Constitution. This strengthened rule-making power was discussed in Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice:[54]

The 1987 Constitution molded an even stronger and more independent judiciary. Among others, it enhanced the rule[-]making power of this Court. Its Sec. 5(5), Article VIII provides:

[x x x x]

Section 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:

[x x x x]

(5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court.

The rule[-]making power of this Court was expanded. This Court for the first time was given the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. The Court was also granted for the first time the power to disapprove rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies. But most importantly, the 1987 Constitution took away the power of Congress to repeal, alter, or supplement rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure. In fine, the power to promulgate rules of pleading, practice and procedure is no longer shared by this Court with Congress, more so with the Executive.[55] (Italics omitted)

The 1987 Constitution did not patently strengthen the exclusive rule-­making power of the Court only for the Court itself to neglect it.[56] Rules are promulgated for the benefit of all, and the Court is duty-bound to follow them and observe the noble purpose for their issuance.[57] Given the applicability and the unequivocal nature of Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, as well as petitioner’s failure to justify his noncompliance with the pertinent rules, it is not only proper but crucial, for this Court to apply the said provision. As the highest court of the land, this Court is mandated to firmly enforce its own rules in order to preserve the integrity of the judicial system and to maintain impartiality in the administration of justice. Otherwise, the fundamental principle of fairness upon which our legal system is built would be rendered meaningless.

In addition, the rule on formal offer of evidence is by no means merely technical. The rule on formal offer of evidence is intertwined with the constitutional guarantee of due process since the parties must be given the opportunity to review the evidence submitted against them and take the necessary actions to secure their case.[58] As laid down in Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC, after the formal offer of evidence of a party, the opposing party is required to immediately interpose his or her objections. Afterwards, the court rules on the formal offer of evidence. Without such formal offer, the opposing party is effectively deprived of the opportunity to object. Thus, the MTC committed no error in its judgment and it properly acknowledged that its hands were tied by the rules when it stated that it could not consider the evidence not formally offered by petitioner.[59]

Neither is the Court swayed by petitioner’s insistence that he was the true winner of the 2018 BSKE. Petitioner relies heavily on the MTC’s statement that the excluded ballots may have changed the results of the revision. Such pronouncement is obiter dictum at best, and highly speculative at worst. The trial court cannot, without crossing into the realm of prejudgment, make an appreciation of ballots not properly admitted into evidence. Furthermore, the MTC uniformly and correctly excluded all ballots not formally offered. Notably, there were seven other ballots being contested and/or claimed by private respondent that were likewise excluded from the revision of ballots for the same reason.

To summarize, petitioner failed to comply with Secs. 11 and 13 of the Rules of Court, in relation to Sec. 3, Rule 12 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended, as well as Sec. 2, Rule 13 of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC. Further, petitioner failed to justify his noncompliance with the rules. If this Court were to extend liberality to petitioner despite his unjustified disregard of the rules, it would directly be taking part in undermining the rule of law and the public’s trust in the judicial system by promoting arbitrariness in the enforcement of procedural rules.

While it has been held in previous cases that “[t]echnicalities and procedural niceties in election cases should not be made to stand in the way of the true will of the electorate,”[60] such pronouncement cannot be construed as a license for parties in election cases to disregard procedural rules altogether. This Court never intended to establish the precedent that the “true will of the electorate” may be used as an excuse for all kinds of procedural errors, no matter how numerous or serious they may be. Noncompliance with the rules of procedure in election cases cannot be justified by the mere invocation of the determination of the “true will of the electorate,” and neither is the liberal application of the rules automatically be granted by such invocation. To rule otherwise would be akin to holding that the technical rules of procedure need not be followed in election cases.

It must be emphasized that rules of procedure are intended to ensure the orderly administration of justice and the protection of substantive rights in judicial and extrajudicial proceedings.[61] It is a mistake to suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to each other, or as has often been suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it will result in prejudice to the substantive rights of the litigants.[62] The actual policy of the courts is to give effect to both, as complementing each other, in the just and speedy resolution of the dispute between the parties. Observance of both substantive rights is equally guaranteed by due process, whatever the source of such rights may be.[63]

Given that the dismissal of the instant petition is warranted, petitioner’s prayer for the issuance of a TRO and/or preliminary injunction need not be discussed.

WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The July 2, 2019 Order of the Commission on Elections First Division and the September 20, 2022 Resolution of the Commission on Elections En Banc in EAC No. 167-2018-B are AFFIRMED.

Petitioner’s urgent prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or status quo ante order and/or preliminary injunction is accordingly DENIED.

SO ORDERED.

BENITO CHUA, SUBSTITUTED BY HIS WIFE, EDITA LIM ONG CHUA AND HIS
CHILDREN, EVELYN CHUA GO, BERNARD ONG, ELEONOR ONG NGU, AND ELIZA
ONG CHUA, PETITIONERS, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED
BY THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS MANAGEMENT BUREAU, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N
HERNANDO, J.:
Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of
Court, seeking to set aside the Decision dated October 17, 2019,[2] and the Resolution dated
September 1, 2020[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. CV No. 110355.
The facts of the case are as follows:
On October 13, 2004, respondent Republic of the Philippines (Republic), represented by the
Director of Lands Management Bureau (LMB), filed a Complaint[4] before the Regional Trial
Court (RTC), as amended,[5] for Annulment of Title and Reversion against Valentina Rivera
(Rivera), Spouses Francisco and Angelito Redor (Spouses Redor), Norma D. Bernardo
(Bernardo), Benito Chua (Chua) and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City.
The Complaint claimed that sometime before 1937, a parcel of land known as Lot No. 23-
C-9, Psd-976, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 23810, situated in Quezon
City and registered under the name of Eulogio Dimaranan (Dimaranan) married to
Estanislawa Guevarra, was constituted as property bail bond in favor of one Ong Sy Pong in
Criminal Case No. 50615, entitled “El Pueblo de las Islas Filipinos, demandante, contra Ong
Sy Pong, demandado.” before the RTC (then Court of First Instance) of Manila.[6] The subject
property was then ordered forfeited and sold in an execution sale in favor of the Republic
and eventually a final deed of sale was executed after Dimaranan and his heirs failed to
redeem the property.[7]
Since TCT No. 23810 was not cancelled yet and no new TCT has been issued in favor of the
Republic, it instituted a petition for the cancellation of the said TCT, which was still under
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
the name of Dimaranan, and prayed for the issuance of a new TCT under the Republic’s
name over the subject property.[8] The RTC of Quezon City, Branch 83, then issued an
Order[9] dated October 3, 1986, granting the petition and ordering the issuance of a new title
in the name of the Republic.[10] The dispositive portion reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Register of Deeds of Quezon City is
hereby directed to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. 23810 in the name of
Eulogio Dimaranan and in lieu thereof, to issue another transfer certificate of
title in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.
SO ORDERED.[11]
However, no new title was issued under the name of the Republic despite the directive of
the trial court.[12]
Meanwhile, on October 13, 1939, Rivera, claiming to be a widow of Dimaranan, filed before
the Bureau of Lands (now LMB) an Insular Government Property Sales Application (IGPSA),
with No. 1989 (E-1068), over the subject land.[13] The application was approved and an
Order for the Issuance of Patent was issued on May 17, 1944.[14]
Subsequently, on May 5, 1959, Rivera executed a Deed of Absolute Sale involving the
subject property, covered by TCT No. 23810, in favor of the Spouses Redor.[15]
Despite the sale of the subject property to Spouses Redor in 1959, Rivera caused the
reconstitution of TCT No. 23810, and she was issued TCT No. RT-95848 (143840) on
February 12, 1970.[16]
Incidentally, in the July 1, 1983 Order of the Bureau of Lands, it affirmed that the rights of
Rivera over the lot subject of IGPSA No. 1989 (E-1068) has been transferred in favor of the
Spouses Redor.[17]
On May 12, 1994, Rivera executed a Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of Bernardo, selling the
subject property using the reconstituted title and the latter was issued TCT No. 107925 on
the same day – May 12, 1994.[18] Less than a month later or on June 6, 1994, Bernardo
executed a Deed of Absolute in favor of Chua who was issued TCT No. 112259 on June 28,
1994.[19]
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
Thus, the Republic sought for the nullification of the reconstituted title TCT No. RT-95848
(143840), under the name of Rivera, and its derivative titles under the names of Bernardo
and Chua, since all were irregularly issued, considering further that it has already been
forfeited in favor of the Republic.[20]
In his Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim,[21] Chua asserted that he is an innocent
purchaser for value since before he bought the subject property, he verified from the
Registry of Deeds of Quezon City that the TCTs of the previous owners, Bernardo and
Spouses Redor, were clean or bore no annotation or any encumbrance.[22] Even the
reconstituted title under the name of Rivera where Bernardo and Spouses Redor derived
their title was, on its face, clean and free from any adverse claim.[23]
On their part, no responsive pleading was filed by Spouses Redor and Bernardo despite the
Alias Summons duly served unto them, while the Alias Summons for Rivera was unserved.[24]
The RTC dismissed the case against Spouses Redor, Bernardo, and Rivera on the ground of
failure to prosecute, despite the failure of the Republic to file a motion to declare them in
default. Thus, only Chua, as the registered owner of TCT No. 112259 (the latest certificate
of title) remained as the private defendant in the case.[25]
On June 15, 2006, the RTC issued a Pre-Trial Order wherein it was admitted by the parties
that TCT No. 112259 is under the name of Chua and was derived from TCT No. 107925
under the name of Bernardo.[26]
During trial, it was found that Bernardo was Rivera’s eldest child and that at the time the
subject property was sold on May 12, 1994 to the former, the latter was already dead for
almost four years or on August 13, 1990.[27] Also, the Republic, through the LMB, learned of
the circumstances surrounding the subject property when an investigation was conducted
by Land Investigator Romeo Salvado (Salvado) due to a complaint filed by the Spouses
Redor.[28]
During cross-examination, Chua admitted that before he bought the subject property, he
visited and inspected the same and saw many houses erected therein. He allegedly hesitated
at first in buying it since he might be burdened with the ejectment of the residents later
on.[29]
The records further show that in 1994 and 2002, the heirs of Spouses Redor caused the
annotation of an adverse claim on TCT No. 112259, registered under the name of Chua,
claiming rights and interest over the subject property under IGPSA No. 1989 (E-10680).[30]
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
Chua then filed a case for the cancellation of the annotation and in a Decision dated March
13, 2015 of this Court in CA-G.R. CV No. 96274, We affirmed the ruling of the trial court
that the cancellation of the adverse claim is warranted since the Spouses Redor failed to
prove their interest therein since it was already settled with finality by the Supreme Court
in Heirs of Francisco Redor v. Court of Appeals (Redor),[31] that the subject property was
already forfeited in favor of the Government.[32]
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court
On December 11, 2017, a Decision[33] was rendered by the RTC dismissing the complaint and
ruling that the Republic failed to sufficiently prove its allegations that Dimaranan was the
previous registered owner of the subject land; and that it was constituted as a property
bond since it did not present TCT No. 23810 as evidence.[34] Further, the Republic merely
relied on the letter of Land Investigator Salvado which was not testified to and identified by
him in court.[35] Lastly, the RTC declared that Chua is a buyer in good faith since it does not
appear that he was aware of any irregularity in the issuance of Bernardo’s title.[36] The
dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the Complaint against [Chua] is hereby dismissed.
SO ORDERED.[37]
Aggrieved, the Republic elevated the case to the CA.
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
On October 17, 2019, the CA granted the Republic’s appeal and reversed the RTC
Decision.[38] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision dated December 11, 2017
of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 216, Quezon
City, in Civil Case No. Q-04-53944-CV, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Judgment
is hereby rendered:
1. Declaring defendant-appellee Benito Chua a buyer in bad faith, who has no
right to possession and ownership of the property;
2. Declaring TCT No. RT-95848 (143840) in the name of Valentina Rivera and all
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
its derivative titles as NULL and VOID; and
3. Ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to CANCEL any and all
certificates of title traced from TCT No. RT-95848 (143840).
SO ORDERED.[39]
The CA ruled that the Republic had already established ownership of the subject property
due to a previous judgment, citing Redor.
[40] It held that whether the documents the
Republic presented before the RTC are public records or that a copy of TCT No. 23810 was
not presented as evidence are immaterial since the Republic’s right over the subject
property is already stare decisis.
[41] Furthermore, it held that Chua was not an innocent
purchaser in good faith, as Chua, despite being aware of numerous red flags surrounding
the subject property, failed to look beyond the four corners of the Torrens title and exercise
the required precaution of a reasonably prudent man faced with a like situation.[42]
Chua moved for reconsideration, but the appellate court denied the same in a Resolution
dated September 1, 2020.[43]
Hence, the instant petition.
Our Ruling
This Petition has no merit.

The theory that certain
past decisions already
established the
Republic’s ownership
over the subject property
does not need further
presentation of evidence
and thus, it can be
raised for the first time
on appeal
In the Petition, Chua is imputing reversible error to the appellate court for allowing the
Republic to interpose for the first time on appeal the theory that a past ruling has
established its ownership over the subject property.[44] Chua is essentially claiming in the
petition that since this argument was never raised before the trail court, the general rule
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
that parties are not permitted to change their theory of a case at the appellate stage should
have been applied by the CA.
This argument holds no water.
The Rules of Court provides:
Section 15. Questions that may be raised on appeal. — Whether or not the
appellant has filed a motion for new trial in the court below he may include in his
assignment of errors any question of law or fact that has been raised in the court
below and which is within the issues framed by the parties.
[45] (Underscoring
supplied)
Certainly, the proscription of a change of argument on appeal rests on upholding the basic
tenets of equity and fair play.[46] “When a party deliberately adopts a certain theory and the
case is decided upon that theory in the court below, he will not be permitted to change the
same on appeal, because to permit him to do so would be unfair to the adverse party.”[47]
However, this Court has allowed derogation from this principle in exceptional cases and
only if the factual bases of the new theory would not require presentation of further
evidence.
[48]
As applied in the present case, the CA was correct in considering the issue of whether this
Court’s pronouncements in Redor established the Republic’s right over the subject property,
despite the same being raised for the first time on appeal, as the same is pivotal in the just
disposition of the case but does not need the presentation of any further evidence. Being
public record, the appellate court merely needed to verify whether such Resolution exists
and examine its contents to confirm whether the issue of ownership over the subject
property had already been settled with finality by this Court.
Moreover, this is not unfair nor unjust to Chua as he was obviously aware of the existence of
Redor by virtue of him being a party thereto, and he also had the opportunity to challenge
the Republic’s argument without needing to present any further evidence, in his Appellee’s
Brief[49] and even in his Motion for Reconsideration[50] before the CA.
Certainly, the appellate court acted within its discretion and did not commit any reversible
error when it took into account the Republic’s argument raised for the first time on appeal.
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023

There is stare decisis
only as to the Republic’s
standing as the rightful
party to challenge the
sale between Bernardo
and Chua, and the TCTs
involved
In its Decision, the CA applied the concept of stare decisis when it ruled that Redor
established the Republic’s ownership over the subject lot.[51] In particular, the appellate
court quoted this Court’s pronouncement that the subject property was earlier forfeited to
the government and concluded from there that this Court already “found and ruled on the
Republic’s right over the property.”[52]
While partly true, this is not entirely the case.
In Redor,
[53] this Court issued a Resolution dismissing the petition and affirming the findings
of the RTC and the CA therein, to wit:
We are in full agreement with the appellate court that petitioners have not
established their ownership or any vested right over the disputed land as to
clothe them with the legal capacity to institute the action for cancellation of
titles. The averment in the complaint that the late Francisco Redor, Sr. merely
had a pending IGPSA clearly shows that the deceased had acquired no title over
the land in question which he could validly transmit to his heirs. The inescapable
conclusion therefore is that petitioners, as heirs of Redor, Sr., also did not
acquire any vested right over the property. As correctly observed by the Court of
Appeals, if there is anyone whose right was affected by the sale between Benito
Chua and Norma Bernardo, it is the Republic of the Philippines. As earlier noted,
the disputed land was forfeited in favor of the Government when the same was
used as a property bond in a criminal case where the accused jumped bail.
ACCORDINGLY, in view of the foregoing, the petition is DENIED for lack of
merit. Costs against petitioners.
SO ORDERED.[54] (Underscoring supplied)
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
From the above, the following can be concluded:
1. The Spouses Redor and their heirs have acquired no right over the subject property as
the last surviving spouse died pending their patent application over the subject
property;
2. Given that no patent was ever issued, the right over the property remained with the
Republic, which initially acquired the same through a forfeiture sale in connection with
a past criminal case; and
3. Having the right over the subject property, the Republic is the proper party to
question the alleged sale of the subject property between Bernardo and Chua.
However, while there is an acknowledgment of the Republic’s right over the subject
property, this right must still be tested against Chua’s as seen in this Court’s affirmation of
the appellate court’s observation that “if there is anyone whose right was affected by the
sale between Benito Chua and Norma Bernardo, it is the Republic of the Philippines.”[55]
Clearly, if there is any ownership right recognized by this Court, it is only to the extent of
the Republic’s standing to question the alleged sale that resulted in Chua obtaining his own
title over the property, which is precisely what is happening in the instant case.
Thus, there can be no stare decisis as to the issue of the Republic’s ownership over the land
as against Chua’s since the same was not threshed out in the previous case. There is only
stare decisis as to the ruling that the Spouses Redor and their heirs have not acquired any
right over the subject property, and that the Republic, having a right over the property, is
the proper party to question the ostensible ownership of Chua over the property and the
sale which it stemmed from.
In view of the above, the only question then left to be resolved is whether Chua was an
innocent purchaser for value, as this is the only case that gives Chua a valid claim over the
subject land versus the Republic.

Chua is not a buyer in
good faith since he
proceeded with the sale
despite knowing that
Bernardo did not have
possession of the subject
property and that there
were numerous houses
built on it
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
In the Petition, Chua seeks to convince this Court that he was an innocent purchaser for
value when he bought the subject property from Bernardo in 1994.[56] He alleges that he
verified with the Register of Deeds that the titles of Bernardo and the Spouses Redor were
clean and bore no encumbrances, including Rivera’s reconstituted title.[57] Furthermore, he
claims that his overt acts such as performing ocular inspections and inquiring about the
status of the title of the subject property with Bernardo, are more than sufficient proof of
good faith on his part.[58]
This Court remains unconvinced.
One is considered a purchaser in good faith if they buy a property without notice that some
other person has a right to or interest in such property and pays its fair price before he has
notice of the adverse claims and interest of another person in the same property.[59]
In Bautista v. Silva[60] and Gabutan v. Nacalaban[61] this Court ruled that for one to be
considered a purchaser for value and in good faith, the following requisites must concur:
A buyer for value in good faith is one who buys property of another, without
notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and
pays full and fair price for the same, at the time of such purchase, or before he
has notice of the claim or interest of some other persons in the property. He buys
the property with the well-founded belief that the person from whom he receives
the thing had title to the property and capacity to convey it.
To prove good faith, a buyer of registered and titled land need only show that he
relied on the face of the title to the property. He need not prove that he made
further inquiry for he is not obliged to explore beyond the four corners of the
title. Such degree of proof of good faith, however, is sufficient only when the
following conditions concur: first, the seller is the registered owner of the land;
second, the latter is in possession thereof; and third, at the time of the sale, the
buyer was not aware of any claim or interest of some other person in the
property, or of any defect or restriction in the title of the seller or in his capacity
to convey title to the property.
Absent one or two of the foregoing conditions, then the law itself puts the buyer
on notice and obliges the latter to exercise a higher degree of diligence by
scrutinizing the certificate of title and examining all factual circumstances in
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
order to determine the seller’s title and capacity to transfer any interest in the
property. Under such circumstance, it is no longer sufficient for said buyer to
merely show that he relied on the face of the title; he must now also show that he
exercised reasonable precaution by inquiring beyond the title. Failure to exercise
such degree of precaution makes him a buyer in bad faith.
[62]
Moreover, this Court in Nobleza v. Nuega[63] and Dy v. Aldea[64] held that to successfully
invoke the ordinary presumption of good faith, the buyer must have shown prudence and
due diligence in the exercise of his or her rights, to wit:
An innocent purchaser for value is one who buys the property of another, without
notice that some other person has a right or interest in the property, for which a
full and fair price is paid by the buyer at the time of the purchase or before
receipt of any notice of claims or interest of some other person in the property. It
is the party who claims to be an innocent purchaser for value who has the burden
of proving such assertion, and it is not enough to invoke the ordinary
presumption of good faith. To successfully invoke and be considered as a buyer in
good faith, the presumption is that first and foremost, the “buyer in good faith”
must have shown prudence and due diligence in the exercise of his/her rights. It
presupposes that the buyer did everything that an ordinary person would do for
the protection and defense of his/her rights and interests against prejudicial or
injurious concerns when placed in such a situation. The prudence required of a
buyer in good faith is not that of a person with training in law, but rather that of
an average man who ‘weighs facts and circumstances without resorting to the
calibration of our technical rules of evidence of which his knowledge is nil.’ A
buyer in good faith does his homework and verifies that the particulars are in
order — such as the title, the parties, the mode of transfer and the provisions in
the deed/contract of sale, to name a few. To be more specific, such prudence can
be shown by making an ocular inspection of the property, checking the
title/ownership with the proper Register of Deeds alongside the payment of taxes
therefor, or inquiring into the minutiae such as the parameters or lot area, the
type of ownership, and the capacity of the seller to dispose of the property, which
capacity necessarily includes an inquiry into the civil status of the seller to
ensure that if married, marital consent is secured when necessary. In fine, for a
purchaser of a property in the possession of another to be in good faith, he must
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
exercise due diligence, conduct an investigation, and weigh the surrounding facts
and circumstances like what any prudent man in a similar situation would do.

In Domingo Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals[66] and Locsin v. Hizon,
[67] this Court elucidated
on the precautionary measures and diligence a prospective buyer of titled lands must
observe to ensure the legality of the title and the accuracy of the metes and bounds of the
lots to be purchased, to wit:
Thus, in Domingo Realty, Inc. v. CA, we emphasized the need for prospective
parties to a contract involving titled lands to exercise the diligence of a
reasonably prudent person in ensuring the legality of the title, and the accuracy
of the metes and bounds of the lot embraced therein, by undertaking
precautionary measures, such as:
1. Verifying the origin, history, authenticity, and validity of the title with the
Office of the Register of Deeds and the Land Registration Authority;
2. Engaging the services of a competent and reliable geodetic engineer to
verify the boundary, metes, and bounds of the lot subject of said title based
on the technical description in the said title and the approved survey plan in
the Land Management Bureau;
3. Conducting an actual ocular inspection of the lot;
4. Inquiring from the owners and possessors of adjoining lots with respect to
the true and legal ownership of the lot in question;
5. Putting up of signs that said lot is being purchased, leased, or encumbered;
and
6. Undertaking such other measures to make the general public aware that
said lot will be subject to alienation, lease, or encumbrance by the
parties[.][68]
In Dueñas v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co.,
[69] this Court summarized the concepts
surrounding the “mirror doctrine” as follows:
In sum, the mirror doctrine provides that every person dealing with a registered
land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title issued therefor
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
and is not obliged to go beyond the certificate to determine the condition of
property. “As such, a defective title, or one the procurement of which is tainted
with fraud and misrepresentation — may be the source of a completely legal and
valid title, provided that the buyer is an innocent third person who, in good faith,
relied on the correctness of the certificate of title, or an innocent purchaser for
value.”
However, the said rule admits of certain exceptions, namely: (a) when the party
has actual knowledge of facts and circumstances that would impel a reasonably
cautious man to make further inquiry; (b) when the buyer has knowledge of a
defect or the lack of title in his vendor; or (c) when the buyer/mortgagee is a
bank or an institution of similar nature as they are enjoined to exert a higher
degree of diligence, care, and prudence than individuals in handling real estate
transactions.[70] (Underscoring supplied)
In light of the foregoing, it can be concluded from the totality of circumstances that Chua
had knowledge of a defect or the lack of title in his vendor, or at the very least, had actual
knowledge of facts and circumstances that would impel a reasonably cautious man to make
further inquiry.
The most obvious badge that Chua is not a buyer in good faith is when he admitted that
Bernardo was not in possession of the property and there were numerous houses on the
property.[71] This alone should have alerted him to not rely solely on the certificate of title
and investigate further into Bernardo’s right over the property, which he utterly failed to do.
While he did admit that he went to the property twice sometime in May 1994 and talked to
at least two people, who allegedly told him that they talked with Bernardo and promised him
that they will vacate the property,[72] his subsequent actions were inconsistent with that of
an ordinarily cautious and prudent person put in a similar situation.
The records would show that Chua merely relied on Bernardo’s claims and statements from
strangers that he just met, to wit:[73]
Q: Now, when you went there on May 1994, what did you find in the said
property?
A: When I went there I saw many houses and I told the owner that : “Baka
naman hindi mapapaalis yan hindi ako interesado. Kasi mahirap naman na
ako pa ang magpapaalis dyan” and I also told her that there are many houses
we better not talk about the price, sir.
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
The above shows that Chua did not conduct an investigation at all. What his statements
show is that despite having reservations in buying the property because of the numerous
houses in it, he still wholeheartedly relied on the attestations and promises of Bernardo and
her alleged relatives, without even so much of a hint of suspicion or doubt despite knowing
that she was not in possession of the subject property.
Chua is absolutely wrong in claiming that by simply going through the motions of visiting
the property and inquiring with the vendor, he has already done the investigation expected
of a reasonably prudent person.[75] A reasonably prudent buyer would not have exclusively
relied on the attestations of an apparently eager vendor especially upon discovering that the
latter was not in possession of the property and that there were numerous houses already
built on it. Moreover, a reasonably prudent person would not rely on the verbal promises of
strangers they just met, especially if the same would affect the parcel of land they are trying
to acquire.
When there are red flags, a buyer in good faith is expected to make honest efforts,
consistent with the standard of a reasonably prudent person faced with a like situation, to
ascertain the truth of the seller’s right over the property beyond the four corners of the land
title. There is no good faith if the buyer merely relies on the seller’s word and continues to
buy the property despite the presence of obvious defects that are inconsistent with the
G.R. No. 253305. August 02, 2023
seller’s representations.
Certainly, the records show that Chua failed to meet the second and third elements laid
down in Bautista,
[76] i.e., the seller has possession of the land and at the time of sale, the
buyer was not aware of any claim or interest of some other person in the property, or of any
defect or restriction in the title of the seller or in his or her capacity to convey title to the
property.[77] Given this, Chua cannot merely rely on the title of the property and is obliged to
show that he exercised reasonable precaution by inquiring beyond the title, which he failed
to do so in this case. His reckless decision of proceeding with the sale despite the glaring
defects and irregularities surrounding his dealings with the land renders him a buyer in bad
faith.
Consequently, since Chua has failed to prove that he is an innocent purchaser for value, he
does not merit the protection of the law and hence, no valid title can come out of his
transaction with Bernardo. Therefore, the title of the subject property remains with its
rightful owner, the Republic.
Verily, there is no reversible error on the part of the CA when it decided to reverse and set
aside the trial court’s decision.
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The assailed October 17, 2019 Decision of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110355 is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.","The Republic of the Philippines filed a Complaint before the RTC seeking the annulment of Title and reversion of Lot No. 23-C-9, covered by TCT No. 23810, which was originally owned by Eulogio Dimaranan. The property was initially forfeited and sold in favor of the Republic due to a criminal case involving Ong Sy Pong.
Despite the court's order in 1986 to cancel TCT No. 23810 and issue a new title in favor of the Republic, no new title was issued.
Valentina Rivera, claiming to be Dimaranan's widow, filed an application in 1939 and subsequently sold the property to Spouses Redor in 1959.

[ G.R. No. 263227. August 02, 2023 ]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N



HERNANDO, J.:
Accused-appellant XXX appeals the February 23, 2022 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02676-MIN, which affirmed the August 25, 2020 Consolidated Judgment[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,[4] in Criminal Case Nos. 3068-2015, 3069-2015, and 3070-2015, finding XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Incestuous Rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic. Act No. (RA) 8353.[5]
On July 23, 2015, three Informations[6] were filed charging XXX with three counts of Rape. The Informations read:

Criminal Case No. 3068-2015

x x x x

That on or about March 7, 2015, in the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused being the biological father of the complainant, with lewd design, with force, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeeded (sic) in having carnal knowledge [of] AAA,[7] a fourteen (14) year old minor, against her will.

That on or about March 9, 2015, in the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused being the biological father of the complainant, with lewd design, with force, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeeded (sic) in having carnal knowledge [of] AAA, a fourteen (14) year old minor, against her will.
CONTRARY TO LAW.[9]

Criminal Case No. 3070-2015

x x x x

That on or about March 13, 2015, in the Municipality of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused being the biological father of the complainant, with lewd design, with force, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeeded (sic) in having carnal knowledge [of] BBB, 11 years old minor, against her will.
CONTRARY TO LAW.[10]

On arraignment, XXX pleaded not guilty.[11] Pre-trial and trial on the merits followed.[12]



The prosecution presented AAA, BBB, CCC, the older sister of AAA and BBB, and xxxxxxx Municipal Health Officer Dr. Florilyn Pimentel (Dr. Pimentel) who conducted the medical examination of AAA and BBB.[13]

AAA was 16 years old when she testified in court on February 9, 2017.[14] She accused her father of raping her twice. The first was committed on March 7, 2015 and the second was committed on March 9, 2015.[15] Both incidents happened when she was 14 years old.[16]

On March 7, 2015, at around 10:00 p.m., AAA was sleeping with her siblings in their house located at the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx when XXX entered the room, laid down beside AAA, and removed her short pants. She protested and told XXX to leave but XXX threatened to kill her. At that moment, AAA as not able to move due to fear. XXX turned AAA sideways and he inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. Thereafter, XXX left.[17]

Two days after, on March 9, 2015, at around 7:00 a.m. XXX directed AAA’s minor brother, DDD and sister, BBB, to take a bath in the river. When AAA’s siblings left, XXX ordered AAA to go inside the house and then XXX undressed AAA. AAA objected but XXX ignored her protests. Instead, XXX told her to bend down. From behind, XXX inserted his penis into AAA’s vagina.[18]

On March 13, 2015 the third and last incident of rape took place. This time, the victim was BBB. BBB was 15 years old when she testified on September 27, 2018. She narrated that her father raped her inside their house. BBB recalled that her mother and older sister were not around as they looked for cassava to eat. Her younger brother, DDD, on the other hand, fetched water. BBB was cooking when XXX appeared wearing only his underwear. XXX ordered her to lie down. XXX then placed himself on top of BBB and removed her short pants and underwear. XXX then inserted his penis into BBB’s vagina. XXX then warned that if BBB tells her mother, he will kill all of them.[19]

The following day, on March 14, 2015, CCC, the older sister of AAA and BBB, went to their house to wash clothes.[20] While CCC was washing clothes, AAA approached her and revealed what their father had done.[21]

CCC acted upon such revelation the next day, March 16, 2015. She asked the assistance of Barangay Chairman EEE who referred the complaint to the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) of xxxxxxxx. During the meeting, CCC disclosed her fear that her other sister, BBB could have been a victim too. The MSWDO personnel advised AAA to undergo a medical examination with BBB. Thus, when AAA returned to their house, she talked to BBB. BBB then revealed that indeed, XXX also raped her.[22]

Dr. Pimentel examined AAA and BBB on March 16, 2015. She reduced her findings in the medical certificates[23] which stated that there are two hymenal lacerations on AAA and one hymenal laceration on BBB.[24]



The defense presented XXX who vehemently denied the accusation against him.

He alleged that in the year 2015, AAA resided with CCC. However, he brought AAA back into his custody because CCC allowed AAA to work as a babysitter for another family. According to XXX, this infuriated CCC. He suspected that this was the reason CCC filed these cases against him. He added that he and CCC are not in good terms. There was an instance where he punched CCC’s husband because CCC’s husband, without permission, planted coconut trees on the land that XXX mortgaged to CCC.[25]

XXX added that AAA and BBB resented him because he once caught them being absent in school so he scolded and beat them.[26]

He further testified that he was in xxxxxxxx to look for money to pay his debt to CCC when he learned about the rape charges. Upon being informed, he immediately surrendered to the police.[27]



The RTC found XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of incestuous rape. It ruled that the straightforward testimonies of AAA and BBB against their father as the perpetrator, backed up by the medical findings of hymenal lacerations, are credible as opposed to the bare denial of XXX.[28] The trial court thus ruled:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds:

In Criminal Case No. 3068-2015, accused XXX GUILTY of INCESTUOUS RAPE OF A MINOR penalized in Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353. He is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA WITHOUT PAROLE and to pay AAA, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
In Criminal Case No. 3069-2015, accused XXX GUILTY of INCESTUOUS RAPE OF A MINOR penalized in Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA WITHOUT PAROLE and to pay the victim, AAA, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
In Criminal Case No. 3070-2015, accused XXX GUILTY of INCESTUOUS RAPE OF A MINOR penalized in Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353. He is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA WITHOUT PAROLE and to pay the victim, BBB, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
The civil damages shall earn the legal interest of 6% per annum from the finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.[29]

XXX appealed.[30]



XXX argued that AAA and BBB lacked credibility given that their testimonies are inconsistent.

The appellate court, in its Decision dated February 23, 2022, denied XXX’s appeal. It noted that minor inconsistencies may be expected of girls of such tender years, who are unaccustomed to a public trial, particularly one where she would recount such a harrowing experience. It further held that inconsistencies and contradictions in their declarations are quite expected. Nonetheless, inconsistencies and discrepancies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance, truth, or weight of the victim’s clear, convincing, and straightforward testimonies.[31]

The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The 25 August 2020 Consolidated Judgment of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Criminal Case No. 3068-2015, Criminal Case No. 3069-2015 and Criminal Case No. 3070-2015, finding accused-appellant XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of Incestuous Rape, is AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.[32]

Aggrieved, XXX comes before this Court raising the same arguments he raised before the CA in assailing his conviction.[33] He claims that AAA and BBB lacked credibility as they made inconsistent statements. XXX argues that AAA, should have shouted or made some noise as she claimed that XXX supposedly raped her while her siblings were sleeping in the same room. For the second incident, AAA should have avoided being left alone with XXX instead of following him inside the house where she was allegedly raped again.[34]

XXX also avers that BBB’s normal human reaction would have prompted her to be wary of being alone with XXX considering her testimony that the rape on March 13, 2015 was already the second incident. She allegedly should have known that XXX had ill intentions when she was told by XXX, who was then only in his underwear, to enter the house. She should have run away instead of following him.[35]

IWhether the prosecution proved XXX’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.


We rule in the affirmative.
Article 266-A paragraph (1) and Art. 266-B of the RPC state how Qualified Rape is committed. It reads:

Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. — Rape is committed:

1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;
c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.[36]

Article 266-B. Penalties.- Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.

Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
x x x x

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:

1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.

The crime of rape becomes qualified when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.[37] Thus, the elements of Qualified Rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim.[38]

The prosecution sufficiently established and proved all the elements of Qualified Rape. We give deference to the factual findings of the trial court, especially when it is affirmed by the CA, because when the trial court looks through the case, it observes in actuality the conduct of each witness. It studies every area that is in question through the utmost assessment of all evidence. As a result, appellate courts will uphold these factual findings when there are no errors in appreciation of material facts or circumstances.[39] Thus, there is no reason to deviate from the ruling of the RTC and CA which found XXX guilty of three counts of Qualified Rape. AAA and BBB testified that their father, XXX, inserted his penis in their private parts to satisfy his lust, on three different occasions. However, the offense should be more accurately termed as Qualified Statutory Rape. Their Certificates of Live Birth[40] proved their minority at the time of the commission of rape.

AAA and BBB narrated the traumatic experiences they suffered because of their father. AAA categorically testified on the first and second incidents of rape which happened on March 7, 2015 and March 9, 2015, and the subject of Criminal Case Nos. 3068-2015, 3069-2015, in this manner, respectively:

There can be carnal knowledge even when the penis was not completely inserted into the vagina and the hymen of the victim was not ruptured.[44] Even when the penis merely touched the vagina’s labia or the lips of the female organ, the crime of rape is already deemed consummated[45] such as what happened in the case of BBB. For elucidation, We cite the recent pronouncement of the Court in People v. Agao,[46] viz.:

This operative definition, however, as will be demonstrated, calls for a clarificatory rephrasing, as its physical characterization below proves the same to be either inconsistent or otherwise problematic and uncertain. For the avoidance of doubt and for pedagogical purposes, the Court finds it necessary to herein include a brief descriptive discussion of the parts of the external female genitalia including a clear indication of the situs of the pertinent parts, in order to categorically delineate for the bench and the bar which physical threshold, when crossed, constitutes rape in the consummated stage.

The vulva, or pudendum, is a collective term for the external female genital parts that are visible in the perineal area. According to Aikaterini Delivellotou and George Creatsas, in their article “Anatomy of the Vulva[,]” the parts of vulva that are crucial for a clear discussion of the consummation of rape are as follows:

The vulva consists of the [mons pubis], the [labia majora], the [labia minora], hymen, the clitoris, the vestibule of the vagina, the urethral orifice, Skene’s glands, Bartholin’s glands, and the vestibular bulbs x x x.

The anterior and posterior boundaries of the vulva extend from the [mons pubis] to the anus, respectively; its lateral boundaries lie at the genitocrural folds. The vulvar epithelium exhibits regional differences in tissue structure based on embryonic derivation. The skin-bearing [mons pubis], perineum, and [labia] are derived from the embryonic ectoderm. Vulvar skin, like skin at other sites, has a keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelial structure with hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The thickness degree of keratinization of vulvar skin decreases progressively from the [labia majora], over the clitoris, to the [labia minora]. The vulvar vestibule, derived from the embryonic endoderm, is nonkeratinized. x x x [Mons Pubis]

The [mons pubis] (mons Veneris) is the rounded eminence in front of the pubic symphysis, which is formed by a collection of adipose tissue beneath the integument. During puberty, it becomes covered with hair up to its junction with the abdominal wall. The hair pattern, or escutcheon, of most women is triangular. Genetic and racial differences produce a variety of normal hair patterns, with approximately one in four women having a modified escutcheon with a diamond pattern.

[Labia Majora]

The [labia majora] are a pair of prominent longitudinal, cutaneous folds of fibroadipose tissue that are homologous to the scrotum in the male. The structures bear epidermal tissue resembling the dartos tunic of the scrotum, as well as adipose tissue, areolar tissue, blood vessels, nerves, and glands. The [labia majora] also include the terminal extension of the round ligament and, occasionally, a peritoneal diverticulum, the canal of Nuck.

The size of the [labia majora] is related to fat content. Each is approximately 7 to 8 cm in length and 2 to 3 cm in width. The [labia majora] extend downward and backward from the [mons pubis], thus forming the lateral boundaries of a fissure or cleft (the pudendal cleft or rima) into which the vagina and urethra open.

Guided by the foregoing anatomical description, the Court now reiterates, even as it clarifies, that rape of a female victim by a male person through penile penetration reaches the consummated stage as soon as the penis penetrates the cleft of the labia majora, also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, in even the slightest degree. Simply put, mere introduction, however slight, into the cleft of the labia majora by a penis that is capable of penetration, regardless of whether such penile penetration is thereafter fully achieved, consummates the crime of rape.

Necessarily, the Court must now revisit and clarify the language of the description in the cases of Dela Peña, Oliver, Puertollano, Campuhan, Ombreso, Comanda, and Francisco, which have collectively described that the act of rape is considered consummated as soon as the penis touches either the pudendum or the labia of the victim’s vagina.

With careful and decisive reference to the anatomical illustration above, the Court clarifies that when jurisprudence refers to “mere touching,” it is not sufficient that the penis grazed over the pudendum or the fleshy surface of the labia majora. Instead, what jurisprudence considers as consummated rape when it describes a penis touching the vagina is the penis penetrating the cleft of the labia majora, however minimum or slight. Similarly, a mere grazing by the penis of the fleshy portion, not the vulval cleft of the labia majora, will also constitute only attempted rape and not consummated rape, since the same cannot be considered to have achieved the slightest level of penetration. Stated differently, the Court here elucidates that “mere touch” of the penis on the labia majora legally contemplates not mere surface touch or skin contact, but the slightest penetration of the vulval or pudendal cleft, however minimum in degree. (Emphases in the original)

XXX argues that AAA should have shouted or made some noise as she claimed that XXX supposedly raped her while her siblings were sleeping in the same room, and that AAA should have avoided being left alone with XXX instead of following him inside the house where she was allegedly raped again.[47] For BBB’s part, he insists that BBB’s normal human reaction would have prompted her to be wary of being alone with XXX considering her testimony that the rape on March 13, 2015 was already the second incident. She allegedly should have known that XXX had ill intentions when she was told by XXX, who was then only in his underwear, to enter the house. She should have run away instead of following him.[48]

We find these expositions unacceptable.

First, People v. CCC[49] explained that lust is no respecter of time and place. Rape can be committed anywhere even in a bedroom where other family members are sleeping.[50] Jurisprudence further taught us that small and confined spaces will not prevent rape from happening because privacy is not a hallmark of such crime.[51]

Thus, XXX’s illogical contention that AAA should have shouted or made some noise when she was being raped since her siblings were sleeping in the same room does not persuade Us.

Second, We cannot sustain XXX’s contention that AAA should have avoided being left alone with him instead of following him inside the house where she was allegedly raped again.[52]

The Court held that individual differences dictate that there is no singular response when a person encounters a certain situation, especially when involving an extremely traumatic experience such as rape committed by one’s own father.[53] Yet, a child victim should not be judged based on the course of action taken even when it is the opposite of the normal behavior of a mature individual.[54]

Hence, XXX cannot fault AAA for keeping her silence while she was being defiled especially so when it was brought about by fear or an otherwise overwhelming emotion of helplessness.

Third, XXX argues that BBB should have been wary of being alone with him considering her testimony that the rape on March 13, 2015 was the second incident. XXX posits that BBB should have known that he had ill intentions when XXX, who was in his underwear, told her to enter the house. XXX points out that BBB should have run away instead of following him.[55]

The Court explained that the rape victim’s actions are oftentimes influenced by fear rather than by reason.[56] The perpetrator of the rape hopes to build a climate of extreme psychological terror, which would numb the victim into silence and submissiveness.[57] In fact, incestuous rape further magnifies this terror, for the perpetrator in these cases, such as the victim’s father, is a person normally expected to give solace and protection to the victim.[58] Moreover, in incest, access to the victim is guaranteed by the blood relationship, magnifying the sense of helplessness and the degree of fear.[59]

Here, XXX is in no place to question the responses of AAA and BBB to the traumatic stimuli he himself created.

This Court is aware of the theory on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) which was introduced by Roland Summit, M.D. in 1983 as a model for understanding why the behavior of children who have been sexually abused may seem strange to adults.[60] In the United States, expert witnesses described this to have the following stages:

(1)
The first stage, described as “secrecy,” was explained in terms of both what an abuser does and why the child keeps the matter secret – because of embarrassment or shame, “sometimes enforced” by the adult telling the child to keep it secret or suggesting negative consequences if it is revealed.
(2)
The second stage is “helplessness” or the absence of power a child has in a relationship with a parental figure or trusted adult.
(3)
The third stage is “entrapment” and “accommodation” which happen when the child fails to seek protection.
(4)
The stage of “delayed disclosure” which was opined to have the tendency to be delayed because of the child’s fear, shame, or emotional confusion.
(5)
The final stage called “retraction,” which was said to involve the child’s denial that the abuse has occurred.[61]
Selected courts in the United States admit expert testimony on CSAAS for a limited purpose of disabusing the mind of common misconceptions it might have about how child victims react to sexual abuse. It is often used to rehabilitate the credibility of the witness when the abuser suggests that the child’s conduct is inconsistent with the testimony about molestation.[62]

Interestingly, children are often told to be wary of strangers, to cry or shout right away whenever they feel threatened. However, were children taught how to respond when the peril comes from a person so familiar, including their father? In such a situation, should their silence, accommodation, or helplessness be deemed inconsistent to what is normal?

We may have to adjust our perspective and try to see things from the eyes of child victims. Actions which we commonly see as strange and inconsistent to the norm may actually be seen by victims as the only expected recourse or way out for them.

Countless incestuous rape cases come before Us and the defense often attacks the credibility of the victims based on their “inconsistent” responses to what is “normal.” This is not only diabolical but absurd as well. There is a need to correct our minds that these are not actually strange nor inconsistent but the normal course of action on the part of children who are victims of sexual abuse.

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED and the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 23, 2022 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02676-MIN is AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.

Gesmundo, C.J. (Chairperson), Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","The prosecution presented AAA, BBB, CCC, the older sister of AAA and BBB, and xxxxxxx Municipal Health Officer Dr. Florilyn Pimentel (Dr. Pimentel) who conducted the medical examination of AAA and BBB.[13]

AAA was 16 years old when she testified in court on February 9, 2017.[14] She accused her father of raping her twice. The first was committed on March 7, 2015 and the second was committed on March 9, 2015.[15] Both incidents happened when she was 14 years old.[16]

On March 7, 2015, at around 10:00 p.m., AAA was sleeping with her siblings in their house located at the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx when XXX entered the room, laid down beside AAA, and removed her short pants. She protested and told XXX to leave but XXX threatened to kill her. At that moment, AAA as not able to move due to fear. XXX turned AAA sideways and he inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. Thereafter, XXX left.[17]

Two days after, on March 9, 2015, at around 7:00 a.m. XXX directed AAA’s minor brother, DDD and sister, BBB, to take a bath in the river. When AAA’s siblings left, XXX ordered AAA to go inside the house and then XXX undressed AAA. AAA objected but XXX ignored her protests. Instead, XXX told her to bend down. From behind, XXX inserted his penis into AAA’s vagina.[18]

On March 13, 2015 the third and last incident of rape took place. This time, the victim was BBB. BBB was 15 years old when she testified on September 27, 2018. She narrated that her father raped her inside their house. BBB recalled that her mother and older sister were not around as they looked for cassava to eat. Her younger brother, DDD, on the other hand, fetched water. BBB was cooking when XXX appeared wearing only his underwear. XXX ordered her to lie down. XXX then placed himself on top of BBB and removed her short pants and underwear. XXX then inserted his penis into BBB’s vagina. XXX then warned that if BBB tells her mother, he will kill all of them.[19]

The following day, on March 14, 2015, CCC, the older sister of AAA and BBB, went to their house to wash clothes.[20] While CCC was washing clothes, AAA approached her and revealed what their father had done.[21]

CCC acted upon such revelation the next day, March 16, 2015. She asked the assistance of Barangay Chairman EEE who referred the complaint to the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office (MSWDO) of xxxxxxxx. During the meeting, CCC disclosed her fear that her other sister, BBB could have been a victim too. The MSWDO personnel advised AAA to undergo a medical examination with BBB. Thus, when AAA returned to their house, she talked to BBB. BBB then revealed that indeed, XXX also raped her.[22]

Dr. Pimentel examined AAA and BBB on March 16, 2015. She reduced her findings in the medical certificates[23] which stated that there are two hymenal lacerations on AAA and one hymenal laceration on BBB.[24]

The defense presented XXX who vehemently denied the accusation against him.

He alleged that in the year 2015, AAA resided with CCC. However, he brought AAA back into his custody because CCC allowed AAA to work as a babysitter for another family. According to XXX, this infuriated CCC. He suspected that this was the reason CCC filed these cases against him. He added that he and CCC are not in good terms. There was an instance where he punched CCC’s husband because CCC’s husband, without permission, planted coconut trees on the land that XXX mortgaged to CCC.[25]

XXX added that AAA and BBB resented him because he once caught them being absent in school so he scolded and beat them.[26]

He further testified that he was in xxxxxxxx to look for money to pay his debt to CCC when he learned about the rape charges. Upon being informed, he immediately surrendered to the police.[27]

Ruling of the Regional Trial Court

The RTC found XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of incestuous rape. It ruled that the straightforward testimonies of AAA and BBB against their father as the perpetrator, backed up by the medical findings of hymenal lacerations, are credible as opposed to the bare denial of XXX.[28] The trial court thus ruled:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds:

In Criminal Case No. 3068-2015, accused XXX GUILTY of INCESTUOUS RAPE OF A MINOR penalized in Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353. He is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA WITHOUT PAROLE and to pay AAA, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
In Criminal Case No. 3069-2015, accused XXX GUILTY of INCESTUOUS RAPE OF A MINOR penalized in Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA WITHOUT PAROLE and to pay the victim, AAA, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
In Criminal Case No. 3070-2015, accused XXX GUILTY of INCESTUOUS RAPE OF A MINOR penalized in Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353. He is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA WITHOUT PAROLE and to pay the victim, BBB, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.
The civil damages shall earn the legal interest of 6% per annum from the finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.[29]

XXX appealed.[30]",Whether the prosecution proved XXX’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.,"XXX argued that AAA and BBB lacked credibility given that their testimonies are inconsistent.

The appellate court, in its Decision dated February 23, 2022, denied XXX’s appeal. It noted that minor inconsistencies may be expected of girls of such tender years, who are unaccustomed to a public trial, particularly one where she would recount such a harrowing experience. It further held that inconsistencies and contradictions in their declarations are quite expected. Nonetheless, inconsistencies and discrepancies on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance, truth, or weight of the victim’s clear, convincing, and straightforward testimonies.[31]

The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The 25 August 2020 Consolidated Judgment of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, Criminal Case No. 3068-2015, Criminal Case No. 3069-2015 and Criminal Case No. 3070-2015, finding accused-appellant XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of Incestuous Rape, is AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.[32]

Aggrieved, XXX comes before this Court raising the same arguments he raised before the CA in assailing his conviction.[33] He claims that AAA and BBB lacked credibility as they made inconsistent statements. XXX argues that AAA, should have shouted or made some noise as she claimed that XXX supposedly raped her while her siblings were sleeping in the same room. For the second incident, AAA should have avoided being left alone with XXX instead of following him inside the house where she was allegedly raped again.[34]

XXX also avers that BBB’s normal human reaction would have prompted her to be wary of being alone with XXX considering her testimony that the rape on March 13, 2015 was already the second incident. She allegedly should have known that XXX had ill intentions when she was told by XXX, who was then only in his underwear, to enter the house. She should have run away instead of following him.[35]

We rule in the affirmative.
Article 266-A paragraph (1) and Art. 266-B of the RPC state how Qualified Rape is committed. It reads:

Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. — Rape is committed:

1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;
c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.[36]

Article 266-B. Penalties.- Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.

Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
x x x x

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:

1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.

The crime of rape becomes qualified when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.[37] Thus, the elements of Qualified Rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim.[38]

The prosecution sufficiently established and proved all the elements of Qualified Rape. We give deference to the factual findings of the trial court, especially when it is affirmed by the CA, because when the trial court looks through the case, it observes in actuality the conduct of each witness. It studies every area that is in question through the utmost assessment of all evidence. As a result, appellate courts will uphold these factual findings when there are no errors in appreciation of material facts or circumstances.[39] Thus, there is no reason to deviate from the ruling of the RTC and CA which found XXX guilty of three counts of Qualified Rape. AAA and BBB testified that their father, XXX, inserted his penis in their private parts to satisfy his lust, on three different occasions. However, the offense should be more accurately termed as Qualified Statutory Rape. Their Certificates of Live Birth[40] proved their minority at the time of the commission of rape.

AAA and BBB narrated the traumatic experiences they suffered because of their father. AAA categorically testified on the first and second incidents of rape which happened on March 7, 2015 and March 9, 2015, and the subject of Criminal Case Nos. 3068-2015, 3069-2015, in this manner, respectively:

There can be carnal knowledge even when the penis was not completely inserted into the vagina and the hymen of the victim was not ruptured.[44] Even when the penis merely touched the vagina’s labia or the lips of the female organ, the crime of rape is already deemed consummated[45] such as what happened in the case of BBB. For elucidation, We cite the recent pronouncement of the Court in People v. Agao,[46] viz.:

This operative definition, however, as will be demonstrated, calls for a clarificatory rephrasing, as its physical characterization below proves the same to be either inconsistent or otherwise problematic and uncertain. For the avoidance of doubt and for pedagogical purposes, the Court finds it necessary to herein include a brief descriptive discussion of the parts of the external female genitalia including a clear indication of the situs of the pertinent parts, in order to categorically delineate for the bench and the bar which physical threshold, when crossed, constitutes rape in the consummated stage.

The vulva, or pudendum, is a collective term for the external female genital parts that are visible in the perineal area. According to Aikaterini Delivellotou and George Creatsas, in their article “Anatomy of the Vulva[,]” the parts of vulva that are crucial for a clear discussion of the consummation of rape are as follows:

The vulva consists of the [mons pubis], the [labia majora], the [labia minora], hymen, the clitoris, the vestibule of the vagina, the urethral orifice, Skene’s glands, Bartholin’s glands, and the vestibular bulbs x x x.

The anterior and posterior boundaries of the vulva extend from the [mons pubis] to the anus, respectively; its lateral boundaries lie at the genitocrural folds. The vulvar epithelium exhibits regional differences in tissue structure based on embryonic derivation. The skin-bearing [mons pubis], perineum, and [labia] are derived from the embryonic ectoderm. Vulvar skin, like skin at other sites, has a keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelial structure with hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The thickness degree of keratinization of vulvar skin decreases progressively from the [labia majora], over the clitoris, to the [labia minora]. The vulvar vestibule, derived from the embryonic endoderm, is nonkeratinized. x x x [Mons Pubis]

The [mons pubis] (mons Veneris) is the rounded eminence in front of the pubic symphysis, which is formed by a collection of adipose tissue beneath the integument. During puberty, it becomes covered with hair up to its junction with the abdominal wall. The hair pattern, or escutcheon, of most women is triangular. Genetic and racial differences produce a variety of normal hair patterns, with approximately one in four women having a modified escutcheon with a diamond pattern.

[Labia Majora]

The [labia majora] are a pair of prominent longitudinal, cutaneous folds of fibroadipose tissue that are homologous to the scrotum in the male. The structures bear epidermal tissue resembling the dartos tunic of the scrotum, as well as adipose tissue, areolar tissue, blood vessels, nerves, and glands. The [labia majora] also include the terminal extension of the round ligament and, occasionally, a peritoneal diverticulum, the canal of Nuck.

The size of the [labia majora] is related to fat content. Each is approximately 7 to 8 cm in length and 2 to 3 cm in width. The [labia majora] extend downward and backward from the [mons pubis], thus forming the lateral boundaries of a fissure or cleft (the pudendal cleft or rima) into which the vagina and urethra open.

Guided by the foregoing anatomical description, the Court now reiterates, even as it clarifies, that rape of a female victim by a male person through penile penetration reaches the consummated stage as soon as the penis penetrates the cleft of the labia majora, also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, in even the slightest degree. Simply put, mere introduction, however slight, into the cleft of the labia majora by a penis that is capable of penetration, regardless of whether such penile penetration is thereafter fully achieved, consummates the crime of rape.

Necessarily, the Court must now revisit and clarify the language of the description in the cases of Dela Peña, Oliver, Puertollano, Campuhan, Ombreso, Comanda, and Francisco, which have collectively described that the act of rape is considered consummated as soon as the penis touches either the pudendum or the labia of the victim’s vagina.

With careful and decisive reference to the anatomical illustration above, the Court clarifies that when jurisprudence refers to “mere touching,” it is not sufficient that the penis grazed over the pudendum or the fleshy surface of the labia majora. Instead, what jurisprudence considers as consummated rape when it describes a penis touching the vagina is the penis penetrating the cleft of the labia majora, however minimum or slight. Similarly, a mere grazing by the penis of the fleshy portion, not the vulval cleft of the labia majora, will also constitute only attempted rape and not consummated rape, since the same cannot be considered to have achieved the slightest level of penetration. Stated differently, the Court here elucidates that “mere touch” of the penis on the labia majora legally contemplates not mere surface touch or skin contact, but the slightest penetration of the vulval or pudendal cleft, however minimum in degree.

XXX argues that AAA should have shouted or made some noise as she claimed that XXX supposedly raped her while her siblings were sleeping in the same room, and that AAA should have avoided being left alone with XXX instead of following him inside the house where she was allegedly raped again.[47] For BBB’s part, he insists that BBB’s normal human reaction would have prompted her to be wary of being alone with XXX considering her testimony that the rape on March 13, 2015 was already the second incident. She allegedly should have known that XXX had ill intentions when she was told by XXX, who was then only in his underwear, to enter the house. She should have run away instead of following him.[48]

We find these expositions unacceptable.

First, People v. CCC[49] explained that lust is no respecter of time and place. Rape can be committed anywhere even in a bedroom where other family members are sleeping.[50] Jurisprudence further taught us that small and confined spaces will not prevent rape from happening because privacy is not a hallmark of such crime.[51]

Thus, XXX’s illogical contention that AAA should have shouted or made some noise when she was being raped since her siblings were sleeping in the same room does not persuade Us.

Second, We cannot sustain XXX’s contention that AAA should have avoided being left alone with him instead of following him inside the house where she was allegedly raped again.[52]

The Court held that individual differences dictate that there is no singular response when a person encounters a certain situation, especially when involving an extremely traumatic experience such as rape committed by one’s own father.[53] Yet, a child victim should not be judged based on the course of action taken even when it is the opposite of the normal behavior of a mature individual.[54]

Hence, XXX cannot fault AAA for keeping her silence while she was being defiled especially so when it was brought about by fear or an otherwise overwhelming emotion of helplessness.

Third, XXX argues that BBB should have been wary of being alone with him considering her testimony that the rape on March 13, 2015 was the second incident. XXX posits that BBB should have known that he had ill intentions when XXX, who was in his underwear, told her to enter the house. XXX points out that BBB should have run away instead of following him.[55]

The Court explained that the rape victim’s actions are oftentimes influenced by fear rather than by reason.[56] The perpetrator of the rape hopes to build a climate of extreme psychological terror, which would numb the victim into silence and submissiveness.[57] In fact, incestuous rape further magnifies this terror, for the perpetrator in these cases, such as the victim’s father, is a person normally expected to give solace and protection to the victim.[58] Moreover, in incest, access to the victim is guaranteed by the blood relationship, magnifying the sense of helplessness and the degree of fear.[59]

Here, XXX is in no place to question the responses of AAA and BBB to the traumatic stimuli he himself created.

This Court is aware of the theory on Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) which was introduced by Roland Summit, M.D. in 1983 as a model for understanding why the behavior of children who have been sexually abused may seem strange to adults.[60] In the United States, expert witnesses described this to have the following stages:

(1)
The first stage, described as “secrecy,” was explained in terms of both what an abuser does and why the child keeps the matter secret – because of embarrassment or shame, “sometimes enforced” by the adult telling the child to keep it secret or suggesting negative consequences if it is revealed.
(2)
The second stage is “helplessness” or the absence of power a child has in a relationship with a parental figure or trusted adult.
(3)
The third stage is “entrapment” and “accommodation” which happen when the child fails to seek protection.
(4)
The stage of “delayed disclosure” which was opined to have the tendency to be delayed because of the child’s fear, shame, or emotional confusion.
(5)
The final stage called “retraction,” which was said to involve the child’s denial that the abuse has occurred.[61]
Selected courts in the United States admit expert testimony on CSAAS for a limited purpose of disabusing the mind of common misconceptions it might have about how child victims react to sexual abuse. It is often used to rehabilitate the credibility of the witness when the abuser suggests that the child’s conduct is inconsistent with the testimony about molestation.[62]

Interestingly, children are often told to be wary of strangers, to cry or shout right away whenever they feel threatened. However, were children taught how to respond when the peril comes from a person so familiar, including their father? In such a situation, should their silence, accommodation, or helplessness be deemed inconsistent to what is normal?

We may have to adjust our perspective and try to see things from the eyes of child victims. Actions which we commonly see as strange and inconsistent to the norm may actually be seen by victims as the only expected recourse or way out for them.

Countless incestuous rape cases come before Us and the defense often attacks the credibility of the victims based on their “inconsistent” responses to what is “normal.” This is not only diabolical but absurd as well. There is a need to correct our minds that these are not actually strange nor inconsistent but the normal course of action on the part of children who are victims of sexual abuse.

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED and the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 23, 2022 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02676-MIN is AFFIRMED.

In Criminal Case No. 3068-2015, accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY of Qualified Statutory Rape under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 and SENTENCED to SUFFER the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. He is ORDERED to PAY AAA, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

MICHAEL JOHN ROBLES, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



CAGUIOA, J.:
This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] (Petition) filed on May 7, 2016 pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from the Decision[2] dated August 27, 2015 (assailed Decision) of the Court of Appeals (CA) Twentieth (20th) Division and Resolution[3] dated February 29, 2016 of the CA Former Twentieth (20th) Division in C.A.-G.R. CEB-CR No. 02067. The assailed Decision affirmed the Decision[4] dated November 29, 2012 rendered by Branch 48, Regional Trial Court of Tagbilaran City (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 15640 (RTC Decision), which, in turn, affirmed the Judgment[5] dated February 9, 2012 rendered by Branch 2, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Tagbilaran City (MTCC) in Criminal Case No. 17603 (MTCC Judgment) which found petitioner Michael John N. Robles (Robles) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code[6] (RPC).
The accusatory portion of the Information against Robles reads:

That on or about the 27th day of July 2009, in the City of Tagbilaran, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously drive without license an unregistered Suzuki Raiders motorcycle with no plate number along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue, Tagbilaran City, in a careless, negligent and imprudent manner, in violation of the traffic rules and regulations and ordinances, without due regard to safety, life and property and without taking the necessary precautions to avoid accident to person or damage to property, thereby causing by such carelessness, negligence and imprudence said Suzuki Raiders motorcycle to hit and bump a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle bearing plate No. GL-6197 driven by Ronelo Franco Solas causing damage to the motorcycle in the amount of FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY PESOS ([P]4,570.00), Philippine Currency, causing death to the latter and less serious physical injuries to the backrider Renilda S. Dimpel, to wit: ‘ABRASION ON LEFT ILIAC & LUMBAR AREA, ABRASIONS ON LEFT FOREARM’ and which injuries have incapacitated or will incapacitate her from performing her customary labor for a period of seven (7) to ten (10) days barring complications not apparent at the time of examination, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of Ronelo Franco Solas and Renilda S. Dimpel.[7]

When arraigned on March 25, 2010, Robles pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.[8] After the pre-trial was terminated, trial on the merits ensued.



This case is rooted in a vehicular collision that happened between a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle driven by Ronelo Solas (Ronelo) and a Suzuki Raider motorcycle[9] driven by Robles. The mishap occurred at the wee hours of July 27, 2009 in Tagbilaran City, particularly, along the intersection of Carlos P. Garcia North Avenue (CPG Avenue), a through street or highway, Calceta Street leading to the east, and Benigno Aquino Avenue (formerly Airport Road) leading to the northwest.[10]
As might be expected, the prosecution and defense had conflicting versions of how the mishap happened. The conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense, respectively, are as follows:



The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Renilda S. Dimpel (Renilda), Carmelino Franco Solas (Carmelina), and Arcadio Bendanillo.[11]

According to the prosecution, in the evening of July 26, 2009, Renilda was with the family of Carmelino in Tagbilaran City. At around 1:00 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Renilda decided to go home. Ronelo offered to take her home using a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle with Plate No. GL-6197.[12] While they were navigating CPG Avenue, and upon reaching the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street, a speeding Suzuki Raider motorcycle, with no plate number, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street causing the collision of the two motorcycles. Renilda and Ronelo were flung away as a result thereof.[13]

Robles was the driver of the Suzuki Raider motorcycle which collided with Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. Robles had no driver’s license and his motorcycle had no plate. He did not give assistance to Renilda or to the family of Ronelo.[14]

As a result of the collision, both Ronelo and Renilda were brought to Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital (Gallares Hospital). Ronelo, because his condition was critical, was later transferred to Ramiro Community Hospital.[15] At around 9:20 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Ronelo died due to his injuries. Meanwhile, Renilda was transferred to Borja Family Hospital where she paid P19,533.50 for medical expenses. Her injuries healed within 7-14 days.[16] Carmelina, Ronelo’s brother, stated that he paid for all the hospital, funeral, and burial expenses incurred by and for his brother, including attorney’s fees in the amount of P99,587.67 and P85,766.15. Ronelo had a professional driver’s license and the Yamaha Crypton motorcycle he drove was duly registered.[17]

Arcadio Bendanillo, a habal-habal driver, corroborated the testimony of Renilda. He declared that he was near St. Jude Hospital when he saw a Suzuki Raider motorcycle cross CPG Avenue without stopping at the intersection, and thereafter colliding with a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. He later came to know the drivers of the Suzuki Raider and Yamaha Crypton motorcycles as Robles and Ronelo, respectively.[18]



The defense presented eight witnesses, namely Robles, Bonifacio Dinampo (Dinampo), Police Officer 3 Fabio Maulas (PO3 Maulas), Dr. Glenn Eduard Oppus, Concordia Robles, Renan Lopos (Lopos), Alma Paelmao, and Dr. Isagani Jodi de los Santos (Dr. de los Santos).[19]

According to the defense, on July 27, 2009, at around 1:10 a.m., Robles was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue with Lopos as his back rider. Upon reaching the CPG Avenue — Benigno Aquino Avenue intersection, he signaled to turn left. But then, a speeding motorcycle driven by Ronelo, with back rider Renilda, suddenly came from behind him and without slowing down, attempted to overtake him, causing the collision of the two vehicles. The incident was witnessed by many people who were at the vicinity and who were interviewed by the responding policeman who came to the site to conduct an investigation. As a result of the incident, Robles suffered injuries and his motorcycle was damaged.[20]

Robles offered in evidence pictures showing the damages to his motorcycle, which were all on its left side. According to Robles, this negates the prosecution’s claim that he came from Calceta Street, because if the prosecution’s version is to be believed, then there would have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, but it had none. According to Robles, he was actually cruising along CPG Avenue, but when he was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, he was hit by Ronelo’s speeding motorcycle when the latter attempted to overtake him.[21] Robles was also brought to Gallares Hospital for treatment and there he declared that he was hit by a speeding motorcycle.[22]

Dr. de los Santos, Ronelo’s attending physician at Ramiro Community Hospital, testified that, based on Ronelo’s admitting notes and history, as well as interviews taken of the persons accompanying Ronelo, Ronelo after having “a drinking spree with his friends”[23] drove his motorcycle during which he collided with another motorcycle.[24] He added that Ronelo “had this intoxicated or positive alcoholic breath” when he was examined at the hospital.[25]

Lopos, a holder of a driver’s license and who, at the time of the mishap, was Robles’ back rider, corroborated Robles’ testimony. The testimonies of Robles and Lopos were likewise corroborated by Dinampo, a habal-habal driver who witnessed the collision between the two motorcycles.[26] According to Dinampo, while he was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue near St. Jude Hospital with a passenger on board, he saw Robles, with back rider Lopos, signaling to the left when a speeding Yamaha Crypton motorcycle driven by Ronelo bumped the motorcycle of Robles.[27]

PO3 Maulas testified that he, in his capacity as traffic investigator, conducted factual gathering and interviewed witnesses and bystanders available right after the incident, and prepared a police report and sketch based on his investigation.[28] Based on his police report and sketch, the motorcycles driven by Robles and Ronelo, respectively, were actually travelling in the same direction of CPG North Avenue, both heading north,[29] which was contrary to the claim of the prosecution witnesses that Robles came speeding from Calceta Street. When Robles, who was ahead at the intersection, made a signal to the left to turn towards Benigno Aquino Avenue, the speeding Yamaha Crypton motorcycle of Ronelo suddenly overtook at the left side,[30] resulting in a collision of the two motorcycles in front of Saint Jude Hospital. Consistent with Robles’ testimony, PO3 Maulas’ police report indicates that Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle sustained damages on its left side[31] while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side.[32]



On February 9, 2012, the MTCC found Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge against him, and sentenced Robles to suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year of prision correccional as minimum to five (5) years of prision correccional as maximum.[33] The MTCC found credible the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that Ronelo was driving along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, while Robles, coming from Calceta Street, suddenly crossed the intersection into CPG Avenue, thereby causing the collision,[34] in violation of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code[35] (Traffic Code), particularly Sections 42 (d)[36] and 43 (c)[37] thereof.

The MTCC considered against Robles the circumstance that Robles was found to have been violating traffic rules, and hence presumed to be negligent.[38] The MTCC noted that Robles was driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver-instructor.[39] The MTCC also concluded that even if Robles’ version of the incident were to be believed, Robles would still be at fault — as Robles, before making a left turn, should have made sure that the road was clear of vehicles on both sides, and that had he done so, he “could have seen the fast speeding motorcycle behind which x x x according to him[,] attempted to overtake him.”[40] As such, the MTCC disposed the case as follows:

WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered finding accused John Michael Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ONE (1) YEAR of prison correccional as minimum to FIVE (5) YEARS of prison correccional as maximum and ordering the accused to pay the following:

To Renilda Dimpel the amount of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]20,000.00) as nominal damages;
To the Heirs of Ronelo Franco Solas in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]50,000.00) as death indemnity;
To Carmelino Franco Solas in the amount of ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE PESOS AND 82/100 ([P]102,653.82) as actual damages and temperate or moderate damages of THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS ([P]35,000).
SO ORDERED.[41]

Petitioner appealed the MTCC Judgment before the RTC. The RTC, in a Decision dated November 29, 2012, sustained the ruling arrived at by the MTCC, and concluded that the latter’s findings were based on the evidence on record.[42] On January 23, 2013, the RTC denied Robles’ motion for reconsideration.[43] Robles thereafter appealed to the CA via a petition for review.[44]



In the assailed Decision, the CA denied the appeal and held as follows:

WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 29, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 48 of Tagbilaran City in Crim. Case No. 15640 convicting Michael John Robles for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.[45]

The CA found that there was nothing in the records which showed that the RTC, in affirming the Judgment of the MTCC, overlooked relevant and undisputed facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. Addressing Robles’ claim that he did not come from Calceta Street, and that instead, it was Ronelo who hit his motorcycle when Ronelo attempted to overtake him, the CA likewise ruled that even if Robles’ claim is to be believed, the mishap would not have happened nonetheless, had Robles simply “been in the correct position on the road.”[46]

Hence, this recourse.

In gist, Robles posits that it was Ronelo’s attempt to overtake him, while driving at a very fast speed and under the influence of alcohol, which was the proximate cause of the accident.[47] Contrary to the prosecution’s claim, he did not come from Calceta Street. Rather, he was driving in the same direction as Ronelo along CPG Avenue heading north, and about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, when Ronelo, in the latter’s attempt to overtake Robles, hit Robles’ motorcycle.[48] He argues in this regard that the findings of the police investigator and even the medical records, both of which corroborated his testimony, must be given credence, especially considering that these came from impartial sources.[49]

Finally, he also points out that even the Information filed by the prosecution alleges that both Robles and Ronelo came from the same direction. According to him, the deviation of the witnesses of the prosecution themselves from what was stated in the Information, not only violates his right to due process, but also puts in doubt the credibility of said witnesses.[50]

On February 8, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General filed its Comment[51] to the Petition, where it reiterated that the findings of the lower courts are supported by the evidence on record.[52]



The main question for resolution is whether Robles is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries, and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the RPC.


The petition is impressed with merit.
As a general rule, factual findings of the trial court are accorded great weight and respect especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court. However, as with every rule, there are exceptions. In the case of Quidet v. People,[53] the Court held:

x x x where the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can affect the result of the case, this Court is duty-bound to correct this palpable error for the right to liberty, which stands second only to life in the hierarchy of constitutional rights, cannot be lightly taken away. x x x[54]

In addition, it bears emphasis that “the Court, in the course of its review of criminal cases elevated to it, still commences its analysis from the fundamental principle that the accused before it is presumed innocent.”[55] This presumption continues although the accused had been convicted in the trial court, as long as such conviction is still pending appeal.

After going over the records of this case, the Court is unable to sustain the findings of fact and conclusion reached by the courts below. A careful review of the records inevitably leads to the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the crime charged against him.
 

The defense version is more credible and deserves more weight and credit
 
Reckless imprudence, as defined by our penal law, consists in voluntarily, but without malice, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.[56] It has the following elements: (1) that the offender does or fails to do an act; (2) that the doing or the failure to do that act is voluntary; (3) that it be done without malice; (4) that material damage results from the reckless imprudence; and (5) that there is inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the offender, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition, and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.[57]

Here, the lower courts found to be credible Renilda’s testimony that Ronelo was cruising along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, and that Robles, in violation of traffic laws, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street.[58] This appears to be the lower courts’ assessment of Robles’ guilt, considering that Section 42(d) and Section 43(c) of the Traffic Code, require a driver of a vehicle entering a “through highway” to bring to a full stop such vehicle prior to entering, and to yield the right of way to vehicles approaching in either direction on such through highway.[59] Thus, according to the lower courts, Robles “should have given way to Ronelo Solas who was negotiating a through street or highway.”[60]

The Court, however, disagrees. The Court finds that the premise for the lower courts’ finding is erroneous.

First, PO3 Maulas’ findings, which were reflected in his police report and sketch,[61] and which he thereafter repeated in open court, are clear and categorical that Robles did not, in fact, come from Calceta Street. Rather, at the time of the incident, he was driving along CPG Avenue heading north, and was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue at the intersection when Ronelo attempted to overtake him.[62]

In PO3 Maulas’ police report, which he prepared immediately after the incident, and which was duly recorded in the traffic blotter of the Philippine National Police, Tagbilaran City Police Station,[63] he reported that:

Further investigation revealed that the two motorcycle[s] involved were travelling on the same direction along CPG North Avenue heading towards North and upon reaching in front of St. Jude Hospital they collided with each other, when the Suzuki Raider MC which was ahead signaled and about to turn left towards B. Aquino Avenue while the speeding Yamaha MC suddenly overtook at the left side.[64]

Likewise, PO3 Maulas’ testimony was categorical that based on his investigation, Robles actually came from CPG Avenue, and not from Calceta Street. In other words, his findings directly contradicted Renilda’s testimony. He testified that:

Q:
In the scene Mr. Witness, based on your sketch could you tell us what were your findings as far as who caused the collision based on your investigation?
x x x x
A:
They collided to each other because this motorcycle, the Suzuki Raiders Motorcycle when about to turn left, suddenly the speeding Yamaha Crypton Motorcycle passed at the left side and they collided. The reason, it is an accidental. I presumed, it was accidental.
x x x x
Q:
Now, you mentioned earlier that this Renilda Dimpel told you that the other motorcycle was coming from the other road, this Calceta Street. Now, could you explain to us Mr. Witness, when you heard from Renilda Dimpel that information, and why is it that what Renilda Dimpel told you is not indicated in your police report?
A:
Because based on the investigation there was no indication that the other motorcycle came from that road Calceta Street because if ever the collision happened in that particular point he would be thrown to the other portion of the road. He must be thrown to the North CGP Avenue which is ahead of the intersection not in this portion which is different from my sketch where this portion that the vehicle was thrown is the intersection of Calceta and CPG Avenue.[65] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
PO3 Maulas’ police report and sketch also indicated that Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle sustained damages on its left side while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side. He testified on this point that:

[Direct examination of PO3 Maulas by Atty. Cristifil D. Baluma]

Q:
Now, concerning the sketch which you prepared and you labeled A and B, may we know if at the time when you arrived, may we know if [these] two labels indicated the position where you saw the two motorcycles?
A:
Yes, they were in that position.
x x x x
Q:
Now on the basis of the damages which you placed on this sketch, please tell us what were your findings or your observations?
A:
(Witness reading)
The Suzuki Raiders Motorcycle incurred damages: x x x Change pedal deformed, left driver’s foot rest slightly deformed, left near foot rest cut, etc.
Q:
How about your observation of the other motorcycle as far as the Yamaha Crypton. Could you tell us your observation of the damages?
A:
The Yamaha Crypton incurred damages: x x x the foot brake lever deformed, front right signal light detached, hand brake lever cut, etc.[66]
Notably, such findings are likewise reflected in the photographs of Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle taken after the incident,[67] which indicate that the motorcycle sustained damages only on its left side, particularly on the change pedal and driver’s left foot rest.[68]

More importantly, on cross examination, PO3 Maulas was unwavering that despite interviewing both Renilda and Robles, he found Robles’ account to be more consistent with his factual findings, while Renilda’s account was, in his view, improbable. Thus:

[Cross-examination of PO3 Maulas by Atty. Menedio Thadeus P. Bernido]
 

Q:
What were your basis in saying that the motorcycle came from this portion South portion of CPG North?
A:
Because if ever that Suzuki Raider came from Calceta Street, he should be placed in the very exact center portion of the CPG and Calceta Street. Whereas, in my sketch here of the incident happened right near the front of the tip of (St.) Jude Hospital.

That is why I am asking you if Michael Robles narrated to you his version of the incident?
A:
Yes Sir.
Q:
And Renilda Dimpel also narrated to you her version of the incident?
A:
Yes Sir.
Q:
But unfortunately Mr. Witness, what has been reflected in your report was the version of Robles, is it not?
A:
I cannot say that I was in the side of Michael Robles because it is just timely that his version was in line with those persons whom I asked Sir.
Q:
So, meaning to say Mr. Witness, that after talking with Michael Robles, and Renilda Dimpel you already knew that there were conflicting versions of what happened?
A:
Yes Sir. But if I will [believe] her it is very far from the truth because there was no indication that he came where he came from, otherwise he could be thrown away from the center.

Q:
So, you mean to say that even if the Yamaha [m]otorcycle was the one [that] hit the Suzuki Raiders, still the Yamaha Crypton was the one [which was] thrown out from the point of impact? That is what you are trying to say?
A:
The Suzuki Raiders only turned and then the Yamaha Crypton was the one being thrown. The Yamaha Crypton was thrown forward.
Q:
But you will agree with me that the two colliding vehicles after the collision they could be thrown anywhere?
A:
It depends.
Q:
So, it could be also possible that this Suzuki Raiders was coming from Calceta Street and this Yamaha Crypton also coming from the South of CPO Avenue and after reaching in the intersection of Calceta and Airport Road [or Benigno Aquino Avenue] and after colliding each other they were thrown in their respective position[s] as shown in the sketch. It is also possible?
A:
It is very remote Sir. Because what was being hit was the change pedal of the Suzuki Raiders. So, it could be impossible if it goes left side ways. It must be in the right.[69] (Emphasis supplied and underscoring)
It bears stressing that PO3 Maulas did not simply wrest his findings out of thin air. As testified by him, said findings were based on his interviews with various bystanders and witnesses,[70] on the damages actually sustained by the two motorcycles,[71] and on his own independent assessment of the relative positions of the vehicles when he arrived at the scene of the accident.[72] Ultimately, based on the totality of such evidence, PO3 Maulas categorically concluded that Renilda’s version is “very far from the truth,” “very remote,” and, in fact, “impossible.”[73]

Indeed, the damages sustained by the two motorcycles, as well as the relative positions of the motorcycles, as observed by PO3 Maulas and inferred from said damages, constitute real evidence that ranks higher in the hierarchy of evidence compared to testimonial evidence.[74]

It is well-settled that object or physical evidence, when offered in accordance with the requisites for its admissibility, becomes evidence of the highest order and speaks more eloquently than witnesses put together.[75] It has been characterized as “that mute but eloquent manifestations of truth which rate high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence,”[76] such that “where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimonial evidence of the prosecution witnesses, x x x the physical evidence should prevail.”[77] Thus, in People v. Vasquez,[78] this Court refused to lend credence to the incriminating assertions of prosecution witnesses as to an alleged mauling, and stated that “[t]his Court cannot be persuaded by the prosecution’s claim of perpetration of physical violence in the absence of any marked physical injuries on the various parts of the victim’s face and body.”[79]

The same principle finds relevance here, considering that the physical evidence belies the prosecution’s testimonial evidence.

Yet, neither the MTCC, the RTC, nor the CA attempted to remotely discuss why the findings of PO3 Maulas, and more importantly, the nature and locations of the damages sustained by the said motorcycles, did not at all warrant any consideration. In convicting Robles, the lower courts simply and solely relied on Renilda’s testimony, which they precipitously concluded to be credible, without any explanation as to why such version deserves more credence than the traffic investigator’s investigation report.[80] On this score, the Court finds the lower courts to have been mistaken and, to a degree, remiss in the performance of their duties.[81]

Second, PO3 Maulas’ account has in its favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, which presumption the prosecution utterly failed to overturn.

In Yap v. Lagtapon,[82] the Court described the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties in this wise:

The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties is an aid to the effective and unhampered administration of government functions. Without such benefit, every official action could be negated with minimal effort from litigants, irrespective of merit or sufficiency of evidence to support such challenge. To this end, our body of jurisprudence has been consistent in requiring nothing short of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary to overthrow such presumption.[83] (Emphasis supplied)

The presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty.[84] Conversely, unless the official act in question is irregular on its face,[85] or where the records suggest that the law enforcers involved deviated from the standard conduct of official duty as provided for in the law,[86] the presumption prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.[87] Thus, unless the presumption is rebutted, it becomes conclusive.[88]

Here, the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to show any deficiency or irregularity on the part of PO3 Maulas in the performance of his official duty as the traffic investigator of the accident. Also, the prosecution did not show that he was impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely. As such, PO3 Maulas’ investigation report has in its favor the presumption that official duty had regularly been performed,[89] and thus entitled to weight and respect.
 
Notably, the prosecution simply harped on the fact that PO3 Maulas did not actually witness the accident.[90] However, the Court has time and again given weight to the report of the traffic or investigating officer in cases involving vehicular accidents, even if the investigating officer did not actually witness the accident. In Serra v. Mumar,[91] which involved a civil action for damages in relation to a charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, the Court upheld the traffic investigator’s report despite the investigator not having been an actual eyewitness, thus:

Petitioner insists that the traffic investigator SPO3 Haran Abdullatip’s report should be disregarded because he was not at the scene when the accident happened.

Rarely does it happen that the investigating officer personally witnesses an accident that he investigates, yet this does not mean that his observations are not valid. A traffic investigator’s training and experience allow him to determine how an accident occurred even without witnessing the accident himself.

In this case, Abdullatip had been a traffic investigator for nine years. Even if he arrived at the scene after the accident, he saw the vehicles in their relative positions as a result of the accident. His experience, as well as his evaluation of the statements from various witnesses, guided him in assessing who was at fault. In any case, the presumption of regularity in the exercise of functions is in his favor and therefore his report must be given credence.[92] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Similarly, in BJDC Construction v. Lanuzo,[93] which involved a civil action for damages arising from a road accident, the Court upheld the contents of the police officer’s investigation report as it enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of the police officer’s duties. This presumption was upheld by the Court in this case, as no evidence was adduced to show any deficiency or irregularity in the performance of the police officer’s official duty as the police investigator of the accident, and that it was not shown that he was “impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely.”[94]

Meanwhile, in Manuel v. Court of Appeals,[95] which involved a civil action based on quasi-delict, therein petitioners questioned the accuracy of the sketches prepared by the police investigator, as “it was prepared the day after the incident and the alleged ‘tell-tale’ skid marks and other details had already been obliterated by the heavy downpour which lasted for at least an hour after the accident.”[96] The Court, however, rejected this assertion, as the “strong presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty x x x erases, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, any suspicions that the police investigator just invented the skid marks indicated in his report.”[97]

Finally, in Caminos, Jr. v. People[98] (Caminos), the Court even convicted therein accused of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property based on, among others, the entries in the traffic accident investigation report (TAIR) and sketch made by the traffic investigator depicting the post-collision positions of the two vehicles. In convicting therein accused, the Court noted that the “TAIR itself shows that petitioner approached the intersection in excess of lawful speed x x x which raises the presumption of imprudent driving x x x.”[99]

The foregoing principles find utmost relevance here, especially considering that the traffic investigator’s findings, rather than implicate, actually exonerate the accused.

Certainly, in criminal cases, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot, by itself, overcome the superior presumption of innocence.[100] Corollarily, if the official findings actually favor the accused, then such findings, if unrebutted, should inevitably yield the acquittal of the accused. After all, if the “facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his [or her] guilt, then the evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty and will not suffice to support a conviction.”[101] Indeed, while the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot preponderate over the presumption of innocence,[102] which prevails if not overthrown by proof beyond reasonable doubt,[103] with much more reason should this presumption, if unrebutted, be considered “binding truth”[104] in favor of the accused, especially considering that the accused is protected by the overwhelming presumption of innocence.

Third, contrasting the two versions of the incident, the Court finds the version of Renilda incredible, contrary to the findings of the lower courts.

Indeed, as correctly pointed out by PO3 Maulas, had Robles come speeding from Calceta Street and, in doing so, hit Ronelo’s motorcycle which resulted in Ronelo and Renilda getting flung away, then the point of impact should not have been in front of St. Jude Hospital, which is located at the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street,[105] but rather somewhere further at the middle of the said intersection. In addition, based on the prosecution’s version of the facts, had Robles’s Suzuki Raider motorcycle “hit and bump[ed]”[106] Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle, there should likewise have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, and not on its left side where the change pedal is located.

The relative positions of the two vehicles at the point of impact and thereafter, as reflected in PO3 Maulas’ sketch below, likewise lead to the conclusion that Ronelo was the one who hit Robles and was, in fact, driving at a much faster speed.

(image supposed to be here)
 
That Robles and his motorcycle were thrown further to the north (forward into CPG Avenue) would also indicate that Robles had indeed slowed down, while Ronelo, having gained much momentum, was thrown upon impact. Moreover, had Renilda’s version been true, then Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton should have been flung toward either CPG Avenue or further to the side of Benigno Aquino Avenue, instead of forward into CPG Avenue, as indicated in the sketch.

Even more telling is the fact that the Information itself alleges that Robles was driving “along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue,” consistent with PO3 Maulas’ findings. If Robles really came from the east at Calceta Street and crossed through CPG Avenue at the intersection, as claimed by the prosecution, then why was this not alleged in the Information? Indeed, a defective Information which lacks certain essential allegations may still sustain a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial, and the deficiency was cured by competent evidence presented therein.[107] However, that the Information itself contradicts the prosecution’s evidence, and supports the defense’s version of events, as here, further lends to the conclusion that the latter’s account is indeed more consistent with how the events actually transpired. To be sure, that the prosecution presented a version contrary to that stated in the Information undeniably puts in doubt the entire version of the prosecution as to what truthfully happened. As well, it lends credence to the version of the defense as testified to by Robles, PO3 Maulas, and the other defense witnesses.

Accordingly, a thorough reading of the records of the case induces the Court to believe and approve the defense’s version of the incident. In checkered contrast, the Court finds the version of the prosecution doubtful and incongruous with reality.
 

A causal connection between Robles’ negligence and the injuries or damages complained of was not proven beyond reasonable doubt
 
Notwithstanding the obvious gaps in the prosecution’s evidence, the lower courts alternatively hinge Robles’ conviction on their finding that Robles was then driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver, for which reason, according to the lower courts, he would be presumed to be negligent under Article 2185 of the Civil Code.[108]

Again, the Court disagrees.
 
Gonzaga v. People,[109] and more recently, Ofracio v. People[110] instruct that in order to establish a motorist’s liability for the negligent operation of a vehicle, it must be shown that there was a direct causal connection between such negligence and the injuries or damages complained of.[111] Otherwise stated, mere negligence, presumed or otherwise, does not warrant a conviction under Article 365 of the RPC, as a direct causal connection must additionally be shown between the accused’s negligence and the accident.[112] In the same light, the Court, in Valencia v. People,[113] further held that mere negligence will not suffice because it is the motorist’s willful and wanton act done in utter disregard of the consequence of his or her action, which criminalizes an imprudent or negligent act.[114]

Likewise, Añonuevo v. Court of Appeals[115] clarifies that while the violation of a statute may establish some degree of negligence, pursuant to Article 2185 of the Civil Code, the complainant must nevertheless show that the violation of the statute was the proximate or legal cause of the injury, or that it substantially contributed thereto.[116] After all, negligence consisting in whole or in part, of violation of law, like any other negligence, is without legal consequence unless it is a contributing cause of the injury.[117]

From the foregoing premises, it thus cannot be said that Robles could be presumed negligent, considering that there is no causal connection that could be reasonably drawn between his violations — lack of driver’s license and driving an unregistered vehicle — and the proximate cause of the accident. Additionally, there is also no evidence that the violations even contributed to the accident.

In this connection, the Court notes that the lower courts failed to consider that Robles was, at the time of the mishap, actually accompanied by a back rider in the person of Lopos, a duly licensed driver.[118] In fact, the RTC in the instant case even took judicial notice of the Decision rendered in Crim. Case No. 14906,[119] wherein Robles was acquitted of the criminal offense of driving without a license because he was actually accompanied by Lopos, “a duly licensed driver.”[120] Hence, that Robles only had a student driver’s permit could not at the onset give rise to a presumption that he was negligent, considering that the Traffic Code explicitly allows a student driver to operate a motor vehicle when accompanied by a duly licensed driver.[121]

The foregoing discussions point to no other conclusion than that Robles is not guilty of the crime charged and should consequently be acquitted.
 

Robles’ conviction may not be sustained based on an alternative set of facts not supported by the prosecution’s evidence
 
Finally, to support Robles’ conviction, the CA nonetheless holds that even if Robles’ version were to be believed, he nevertheless should have complied with Section 45(b) of the Traffic Code, which necessitated that he correctly positioned himself “nearest to the center line of the highway” prior to making a left turn,[122] and that he be on the proper lookout for incoming vehicles.[123] “Had he done so,” the CA concludes, “he could have seen the fast speeding motorcycle behind which x x x according to him, attempted to overtake him.”[124] Thus, the CA finds Robles guilty of the crime charged as “had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened.”[125]

Again, the Court disagrees.

Notably, the bulk of the CA’s assailed Decision was centered on justifying Robles’ conviction, if his claim “will be believed that he was also cruising along CPG Avenue when he was hit by the motorcycle driven by Solas on his left side.”[126] It did not, at all, touch on why Robles should be convicted based on the facts as actually presented by the prosecution.

On this score, the CA obviously overlooked that under the defense’s version of the incident: (1) both parties were approaching the intersection from the same direction, (2) thereafter, Robles signaled his intention to turn left, (3) Ronelo, meanwhile, was speeding in his attempt to overtake Robles, and (4) such attempt on the part of Ronelo to overtake caused the collision. Likewise on record is Dr. de los Santos’ testimony finding Ronelo to have been “intoxicated” at the time of this accident.[127] Given these alternative set of facts, it cannot simply be concluded that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have occurred. These are just speculations. There are various other factors at play in a vehicular accident, as here, such as the relative distances and speeds of the two vehicles in their approach of the intersection — which, for obvious reasons, the prosecution, in this case, had not been able to address under the said “alternative” version of the facts.

On this point, the Court’s ruling in Ladeco v. Angala,[128] finds relevance. In that case, a pick-up truck running along the outer lane was slowing down to about five to 10 kilometers per hour (kph) and was making a left turn preparatory to turning south, or a U-turn, when it was bumped from behind by the crewcab which was running along the inner lane at around 60 to 70 kph. Interestingly, the owner of the crewcab alleged therein, as the CA holds in the present case, that the driver of the pick-up did not take the proper lane before executing the U-turn, in violation of Section 45(b) of Traffic Code and hence, it was the latter’s recklessness that was the proximate cause of the accident. The Court, disagreeing with the CA, held that the parties were both negligent, as while the pick-up truck was not in the correct lane, the accident would not have happened if the driver of the crewcab was not driving very fast. The Court went further to say that the crewcab, based on the doctrine of last clear chance, was ultimately at fault. Said the Court:

Since both parties are at fault in this case, the doctrine of last clear chance applies.

The doctrine of last clear chance states that where both parties are negligent but the negligent act of one is appreciably later than that of the other, or where it is impossible to determine whose fault or negligence caused the loss, the one who had the last clear opportunity to avoid the loss but failed to do so is chargeable with the loss. In this case, Deocampo had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. Since Deocampo was driving the rear vehicle, he had full control of the situation since he was in a position to observe the vehicle in front of him. Deocampo had the responsibility of avoiding bumping the vehicle in front of him. A U-turn is done at a much slower speed to avoid skidding and overturning, compared to running straight ahead. Deocampo could have avoided the vehicle if he was not driving very fast while following the pick-up. Deocampo was not only driving fast, he also admitted that he did not step on the brakes even upon seeing the pick-up. He only stepped on the brakes after the collision.[129] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Further, in Caminos, the Court likewise clarified that the right of way rule,[130] as stated in Section 42 of the Traffic Code,[131] is applicable in instances where two colliding vehicles are approaching the intersection at approximately the same time.

In Caminos, the Court held that whether one of the drivers has the right of way or, as sometimes stated, has the status of a favored driver on the highway, is a question that permeates a situation where the vehicles approach the crossing so nearly at the same time and at such distances and speed that if either of them proceeds without regard to the other a collision is likely to occur.[132] Nevertheless, the right of way accorded to vehicles approaching an intersection is by no means a legal straitjacket, and is subject to and is affected by the relative distances of the vehicles from the point of intersection, and their respective speeds.[133] Notably, the Court here declared that “it is much unsafe as it is unjust to assume”[134] that the one making a left turn had performed a risky maneuver at the intersection in simply “failing to keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles.“[135]

Likewise, in Adzuara v. Court of Appeals,[136] a criminal case involving reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with less serious physical injuries, it was established that a motorist crossing a through stop street has the right of way over the one making a turn; but if the person making the turn has already negotiated half of the turn and is almost on the other side so that he or she is already visible to the person on the through street, the latter, having the last clear chance to avoid the accident, is bound to give way to the former.[137]

In sum, a motorist’s liability for a road accident is not determined simply by who among the parties had the right of way or was in the proper lane. Rather, the same is determined by various factors, which include, among others, the relative distances and respective speeds of the vehicles,[138] or who among the parties had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.[139]

To stress, here, the prosecution, and later the lower courts, proceeded on the theory that Robles came from Calceta Street, and not CPG Avenue. As such, the prosecution did not, at all, present any evidence as to the speed and distance of Robles relative to Ronelo, had Robles come from CPG Avenue, and whether such directly caused, or at least materially contributed to, the injuries or damages complained of. Thus, the CA erred in justifying Robles’ conviction based simply on the alternative speculative theory that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened.[140] This undoubtedly does not satisfy the core requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.

To be sure, in a prosecution for reckless driving, the contributory negligence of the person who was injured or who was the driver of the motor vehicle with which the accused’s vehicle collided does not constitute a complete defense.[141] However, it is likewise true that a conviction must rest on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence, and not on the weakness — or in this case, the strength — of the defense.[142]

All told, the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the act and ultimately, the crime, for which he is being charged. The prosecution likewise neither established that Robles committed inexcusable lack of precaution in driving his motorcycle, nor proved that his alleged negligence was the legal cause of the injury complained of.

Based on the abovementioned premises, the Court is likewise unable to sustain the award of damages in favor of Renilda, Carmelino, and the heirs of Ronelo, considering that the prosecution failed to prove that Robles committed the act complained of.[143] On this score, the Court also notes that Robles submitted before this Court[144] affidavits of desistance respectively executed by Renilda[145] and Carmelino,[146] wherein both of them waived their respective claims for damages and indemnity against Robles.[147]

WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. CEB-CR No. 02067 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Michael John Robles is hereby ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove that he committed the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt. If detained, he is ordered immediately RELEASED, unless he is confined for any other lawful cause. Any amount paid by way of a bailbond is ordered RETURNED. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately.

SO ORDERED.

Inting, Gaerlan, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.","This case is rooted in a vehicular collision that happened between a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle driven by Ronelo Solas (Ronelo) and a Suzuki Raider motorcycle[9] driven by Robles. The mishap occurred at the wee hours of July 27, 2009 in Tagbilaran City, particularly, along the intersection of Carlos P. Garcia North Avenue (CPG Avenue), a through street or highway, Calceta Street leading to the east, and Benigno Aquino Avenue (formerly Airport Road) leading to the northwest.[10]
As might be expected, the prosecution and defense had conflicting versions of how the mishap happened. The conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense, respectively, are as follows:

The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Renilda S. Dimpel (Renilda), Carmelino Franco Solas (Carmelina), and Arcadio Bendanillo.[11]

According to the prosecution, in the evening of July 26, 2009, Renilda was with the family of Carmelino in Tagbilaran City. At around 1:00 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Renilda decided to go home. Ronelo offered to take her home using a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle with Plate No. GL-6197.[12] While they were navigating CPG Avenue, and upon reaching the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street, a speeding Suzuki Raider motorcycle, with no plate number, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street causing the collision of the two motorcycles. Renilda and Ronelo were flung away as a result thereof.[13]

Robles was the driver of the Suzuki Raider motorcycle which collided with Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. Robles had no driver’s license and his motorcycle had no plate. He did not give assistance to Renilda or to the family of Ronelo.[14]

As a result of the collision, both Ronelo and Renilda were brought to Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital (Gallares Hospital). Ronelo, because his condition was critical, was later transferred to Ramiro Community Hospital.[15] At around 9:20 a.m. of July 27, 2009, Ronelo died due to his injuries. Meanwhile, Renilda was transferred to Borja Family Hospital where she paid P19,533.50 for medical expenses. Her injuries healed within 7-14 days.[16] Carmelina, Ronelo’s brother, stated that he paid for all the hospital, funeral, and burial expenses incurred by and for his brother, including attorney’s fees in the amount of P99,587.67 and P85,766.15. Ronelo had a professional driver’s license and the Yamaha Crypton motorcycle he drove was duly registered.[17]

Arcadio Bendanillo, a habal-habal driver, corroborated the testimony of Renilda. He declared that he was near St. Jude Hospital when he saw a Suzuki Raider motorcycle cross CPG Avenue without stopping at the intersection, and thereafter colliding with a Yamaha Crypton motorcycle. He later came to know the drivers of the Suzuki Raider and Yamaha Crypton motorcycles as Robles and Ronelo, respectively.[18]

The defense presented eight witnesses, namely Robles, Bonifacio Dinampo (Dinampo), Police Officer 3 Fabio Maulas (PO3 Maulas), Dr. Glenn Eduard Oppus, Concordia Robles, Renan Lopos (Lopos), Alma Paelmao, and Dr. Isagani Jodi de los Santos (Dr. de los Santos).[19]

According to the defense, on July 27, 2009, at around 1:10 a.m., Robles was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue with Lopos as his back rider. Upon reaching the CPG Avenue — Benigno Aquino Avenue intersection, he signaled to turn left. But then, a speeding motorcycle driven by Ronelo, with back rider Renilda, suddenly came from behind him and without slowing down, attempted to overtake him, causing the collision of the two vehicles. The incident was witnessed by many people who were at the vicinity and who were interviewed by the responding policeman who came to the site to conduct an investigation. As a result of the incident, Robles suffered injuries and his motorcycle was damaged.[20]

Robles offered in evidence pictures showing the damages to his motorcycle, which were all on its left side. According to Robles, this negates the prosecution’s claim that he came from Calceta Street, because if the prosecution’s version is to be believed, then there would have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, but it had none. According to Robles, he was actually cruising along CPG Avenue, but when he was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, he was hit by Ronelo’s speeding motorcycle when the latter attempted to overtake him.[21] Robles was also brought to Gallares Hospital for treatment and there he declared that he was hit by a speeding motorcycle.[22]

Dr. de los Santos, Ronelo’s attending physician at Ramiro Community Hospital, testified that, based on Ronelo’s admitting notes and history, as well as interviews taken of the persons accompanying Ronelo, Ronelo after having “a drinking spree with his friends”[23] drove his motorcycle during which he collided with another motorcycle.[24] He added that Ronelo “had this intoxicated or positive alcoholic breath” when he was examined at the hospital.[25]

Lopos, a holder of a driver’s license and who, at the time of the mishap, was Robles’ back rider, corroborated Robles’ testimony. The testimonies of Robles and Lopos were likewise corroborated by Dinampo, a habal-habal driver who witnessed the collision between the two motorcycles.[26] According to Dinampo, while he was driving his motorcycle along CPG Avenue near St. Jude Hospital with a passenger on board, he saw Robles, with back rider Lopos, signaling to the left when a speeding Yamaha Crypton motorcycle driven by Ronelo bumped the motorcycle of Robles.[27]

PO3 Maulas testified that he, in his capacity as traffic investigator, conducted factual gathering and interviewed witnesses and bystanders available right after the incident, and prepared a police report and sketch based on his investigation.[28] Based on his police report and sketch, the motorcycles driven by Robles and Ronelo, respectively, were actually travelling in the same direction of CPG North Avenue, both heading north,[29] which was contrary to the claim of the prosecution witnesses that Robles came speeding from Calceta Street. When Robles, who was ahead at the intersection, made a signal to the left to turn towards Benigno Aquino Avenue, the speeding Yamaha Crypton motorcycle of Ronelo suddenly overtook at the left side,[30] resulting in a collision of the two motorcycles in front of Saint Jude Hospital. Consistent with Robles’ testimony, PO3 Maulas’ police report indicates that Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle sustained damages on its left side[31] while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side.[32]","The main question for resolution is whether Robles is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries, and Damage to Property under Article 365 of the RPC.","On February 9, 2012, the MTCC found Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge against him, and sentenced Robles to suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year of prision correccional as minimum to five (5) years of prision correccional as maximum.[33] The MTCC found credible the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that Ronelo was driving along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, while Robles, coming from Calceta Street, suddenly crossed the intersection into CPG Avenue, thereby causing the collision,[34] in violation of Republic Act No. 4136, otherwise known as the Land Transportation and Traffic Code[35] (Traffic Code), particularly Sections 42 (d)[36] and 43 (c)[37] thereof.

The MTCC considered against Robles the circumstance that Robles was found to have been violating traffic rules, and hence presumed to be negligent.[38] The MTCC noted that Robles was driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver-instructor.[39] The MTCC also concluded that even if Robles’ version of the incident were to be believed, Robles would still be at fault — as Robles, before making a left turn, should have made sure that the road was clear of vehicles on both sides, and that had he done so, he “could have seen the fast speeding motorcycle behind which x x x according to him[,] attempted to overtake him.”[40] As such, the MTCC disposed the case as follows:

WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered finding accused John Michael Robles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ONE (1) YEAR of prison correccional as minimum to FIVE (5) YEARS of prison correccional as maximum and ordering the accused to pay the following:

To Renilda Dimpel the amount of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]20,000.00) as nominal damages;
To the Heirs of Ronelo Franco Solas in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS ([P]50,000.00) as death indemnity;
To Carmelino Franco Solas in the amount of ONE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE PESOS AND 82/100 ([P]102,653.82) as actual damages and temperate or moderate damages of THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS ([P]35,000).
SO ORDERED.[41]

Petitioner appealed the MTCC Judgment before the RTC. The RTC, in a Decision dated November 29, 2012, sustained the ruling arrived at by the MTCC, and concluded that the latter’s findings were based on the evidence on record.[42] On January 23, 2013, the RTC denied Robles’ motion for reconsideration.[43] Robles thereafter appealed to the CA via a petition for review.[44]

In the assailed Decision, the CA denied the appeal and held as follows:

WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 29, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 48 of Tagbilaran City in Crim. Case No. 15640 convicting Michael John Robles for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide, Less Serious Physical Injuries and Damage to Property is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.[45]

The CA found that there was nothing in the records which showed that the RTC, in affirming the Judgment of the MTCC, overlooked relevant and undisputed facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. Addressing Robles’ claim that he did not come from Calceta Street, and that instead, it was Ronelo who hit his motorcycle when Ronelo attempted to overtake him, the CA likewise ruled that even if Robles’ claim is to be believed, the mishap would not have happened nonetheless, had Robles simply “been in the correct position on the road.”[46]

Hence, this recourse.

In gist, Robles posits that it was Ronelo’s attempt to overtake him, while driving at a very fast speed and under the influence of alcohol, which was the proximate cause of the accident.[47] Contrary to the prosecution’s claim, he did not come from Calceta Street. Rather, he was driving in the same direction as Ronelo along CPG Avenue heading north, and about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue, when Ronelo, in the latter’s attempt to overtake Robles, hit Robles’ motorcycle.[48] He argues in this regard that the findings of the police investigator and even the medical records, both of which corroborated his testimony, must be given credence, especially considering that these came from impartial sources.[49]

Finally, he also points out that even the Information filed by the prosecution alleges that both Robles and Ronelo came from the same direction. According to him, the deviation of the witnesses of the prosecution themselves from what was stated in the Information, not only violates his right to due process, but also puts in doubt the credibility of said witnesses.[50]

On February 8, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General filed its Comment[51] to the Petition, where it reiterated that the findings of the lower courts are supported by the evidence on record.[52]

The petition is impressed with merit.
As a general rule, factual findings of the trial court are accorded great weight and respect especially when they are affirmed by the appellate court. However, as with every rule, there are exceptions. In the case of Quidet v. People,[53] the Court held:

x x x where the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can affect the result of the case, this Court is duty-bound to correct this palpable error for the right to liberty, which stands second only to life in the hierarchy of constitutional rights, cannot be lightly taken away. x x x[54]

In addition, it bears emphasis that “the Court, in the course of its review of criminal cases elevated to it, still commences its analysis from the fundamental principle that the accused before it is presumed innocent.”[55] This presumption continues although the accused had been convicted in the trial court, as long as such conviction is still pending appeal.

After going over the records of this case, the Court is unable to sustain the findings of fact and conclusion reached by the courts below. A careful review of the records inevitably leads to the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the crime charged against him.
 

The defense version is more credible and deserves more weight and credit
 
Reckless imprudence, as defined by our penal law, consists in voluntarily, but without malice, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.[56] It has the following elements: (1) that the offender does or fails to do an act; (2) that the doing or the failure to do that act is voluntary; (3) that it be done without malice; (4) that material damage results from the reckless imprudence; and (5) that there is inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the offender, taking into consideration his or her employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition, and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place.[57]

Here, the lower courts found to be credible Renilda’s testimony that Ronelo was cruising along CPG Avenue, a through street or highway, and that Robles, in violation of traffic laws, suddenly crossed CPG Avenue from Calceta Street.[58] This appears to be the lower courts’ assessment of Robles’ guilt, considering that Section 42(d) and Section 43(c) of the Traffic Code, require a driver of a vehicle entering a “through highway” to bring to a full stop such vehicle prior to entering, and to yield the right of way to vehicles approaching in either direction on such through highway.[59] Thus, according to the lower courts, Robles “should have given way to Ronelo Solas who was negotiating a through street or highway.”[60]

The Court, however, disagrees. The Court finds that the premise for the lower courts’ finding is erroneous.

First, PO3 Maulas’ findings, which were reflected in his police report and sketch,[61] and which he thereafter repeated in open court, are clear and categorical that Robles did not, in fact, come from Calceta Street. Rather, at the time of the incident, he was driving along CPG Avenue heading north, and was about to turn left to Benigno Aquino Avenue at the intersection when Ronelo attempted to overtake him.[62]

In PO3 Maulas’ police report, which he prepared immediately after the incident, and which was duly recorded in the traffic blotter of the Philippine National Police, Tagbilaran City Police Station,[63] he reported that:

Further investigation revealed that the two motorcycle[s] involved were travelling on the same direction along CPG North Avenue heading towards North and upon reaching in front of St. Jude Hospital they collided with each other, when the Suzuki Raider MC which was ahead signaled and about to turn left towards B. Aquino Avenue while the speeding Yamaha MC suddenly overtook at the left side.[64]

Likewise, PO3 Maulas’ testimony was categorical that based on his investigation, Robles actually came from CPG Avenue, and not from Calceta Street. In other words, his findings directly contradicted Renilda’s testimony. He testified that:

[Direct examination of PO3 Maulas by Atty. Cristifil D. Baluma]
 

Q:
In the scene Mr. Witness, based on your sketch could you tell us what were your findings as far as who caused the collision based on your investigation?
x x x x
A:
They collided to each other because this motorcycle, the Suzuki Raiders Motorcycle when about to turn left, suddenly the speeding Yamaha Crypton Motorcycle passed at the left side and they collided. The reason, it is an accidental. I presumed, it was accidental.
x x x x
Q:
Now, you mentioned earlier that this Renilda Dimpel told you that the other motorcycle was coming from the other road, this Calceta Street. Now, could you explain to us Mr. Witness, when you heard from Renilda Dimpel that information, and why is it that what Renilda Dimpel told you is not indicated in your police report?
A:
Because based on the investigation there was no indication that the other motorcycle came from that road Calceta Street because if ever the collision happened in that particular point he would be thrown to the other portion of the road. He must be thrown to the North CGP Avenue which is ahead of the intersection not in this portion which is different from my sketch where this portion that the vehicle was thrown is the intersection of Calceta and CPG Avenue.[65] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
PO3 Maulas’ police report and sketch also indicated that Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle sustained damages on its left side while Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton sustained damages on its right side. He testified on this point that:

[Direct examination of PO3 Maulas by Atty. Cristifil D. Baluma]

Q:
Now, concerning the sketch which you prepared and you labeled A and B, may we know if at the time when you arrived, may we know if [these] two labels indicated the position where you saw the two motorcycles?
A:
Yes, they were in that position.
x x x x
Q:
Now on the basis of the damages which you placed on this sketch, please tell us what were your findings or your observations?
A:
(Witness reading)
The Suzuki Raiders Motorcycle incurred damages: x x x Change pedal deformed, left driver’s foot rest slightly deformed, left near foot rest cut, etc.
Q:
How about your observation of the other motorcycle as far as the Yamaha Crypton. Could you tell us your observation of the damages?
A:
The Yamaha Crypton incurred damages: x x x the foot brake lever deformed, front right signal light detached, hand brake lever cut, etc.[66]
Notably, such findings are likewise reflected in the photographs of Robles’ Suzuki Raider motorcycle taken after the incident,[67] which indicate that the motorcycle sustained damages only on its left side, particularly on the change pedal and driver’s left foot rest.[68]

More importantly, on cross examination, PO3 Maulas was unwavering that despite interviewing both Renilda and Robles, he found Robles’ account to be more consistent with his factual findings, while Renilda’s account was, in his view, improbable. Thus:

[Cross-examination of PO3 Maulas by Atty. Menedio Thadeus P. Bernido]
 

Q:
What were your basis in saying that the motorcycle came from this portion South portion of CPG North?
A:
Because if ever that Suzuki Raider came from Calceta Street, he should be placed in the very exact center portion of the CPG and Calceta Street. Whereas, in my sketch here of the incident happened right near the front of the tip of (St.) Jude Hospital.
x x x x
Q:
That is why I am asking you if Michael Robles narrated to you his version of the incident?
A:
Yes Sir.
Q:
And Renilda Dimpel also narrated to you her version of the incident?
A:
Yes Sir.
Q:
But unfortunately Mr. Witness, what has been reflected in your report was the version of Robles, is it not?
A:
I cannot say that I was in the side of Michael Robles because it is just timely that his version was in line with those persons whom I asked Sir.
Q:
So, meaning to say Mr. Witness, that after talking with Michael Robles, and Renilda Dimpel you already knew that there were conflicting versions of what happened?
A:
Yes Sir. But if I will [believe] her it is very far from the truth because there was no indication that he came where he came from, otherwise he could be thrown away from the center.
x x x x
Q:
So, you mean to say that even if the Yamaha [m]otorcycle was the one [that] hit the Suzuki Raiders, still the Yamaha Crypton was the one [which was] thrown out from the point of impact? That is what you are trying to say?
A:
The Suzuki Raiders only turned and then the Yamaha Crypton was the one being thrown. The Yamaha Crypton was thrown forward.
Q:
But you will agree with me that the two colliding vehicles after the collision they could be thrown anywhere?
A:
It depends.
Q:
So, it could be also possible that this Suzuki Raiders was coming from Calceta Street and this Yamaha Crypton also coming from the South of CPO Avenue and after reaching in the intersection of Calceta and Airport Road [or Benigno Aquino Avenue] and after colliding each other they were thrown in their respective position[s] as shown in the sketch. It is also possible?
A:
It is very remote Sir. Because what was being hit was the change pedal of the Suzuki Raiders. So, it could be impossible if it goes left side ways. It must be in the right.[69] (Emphasis supplied and underscoring)
It bears stressing that PO3 Maulas did not simply wrest his findings out of thin air. As testified by him, said findings were based on his interviews with various bystanders and witnesses,[70] on the damages actually sustained by the two motorcycles,[71] and on his own independent assessment of the relative positions of the vehicles when he arrived at the scene of the accident.[72] Ultimately, based on the totality of such evidence, PO3 Maulas categorically concluded that Renilda’s version is “very far from the truth,” “very remote,” and, in fact, “impossible.”[73]

Indeed, the damages sustained by the two motorcycles, as well as the relative positions of the motorcycles, as observed by PO3 Maulas and inferred from said damages, constitute real evidence that ranks higher in the hierarchy of evidence compared to testimonial evidence.[74]

It is well-settled that object or physical evidence, when offered in accordance with the requisites for its admissibility, becomes evidence of the highest order and speaks more eloquently than witnesses put together.[75] It has been characterized as “that mute but eloquent manifestations of truth which rate high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence,”[76] such that “where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimonial evidence of the prosecution witnesses, x x x the physical evidence should prevail.”[77] Thus, in People v. Vasquez,[78] this Court refused to lend credence to the incriminating assertions of prosecution witnesses as to an alleged mauling, and stated that “[t]his Court cannot be persuaded by the prosecution’s claim of perpetration of physical violence in the absence of any marked physical injuries on the various parts of the victim’s face and body.”[79]

The same principle finds relevance here, considering that the physical evidence belies the prosecution’s testimonial evidence.

Yet, neither the MTCC, the RTC, nor the CA attempted to remotely discuss why the findings of PO3 Maulas, and more importantly, the nature and locations of the damages sustained by the said motorcycles, did not at all warrant any consideration. In convicting Robles, the lower courts simply and solely relied on Renilda’s testimony, which they precipitously concluded to be credible, without any explanation as to why such version deserves more credence than the traffic investigator’s investigation report.[80] On this score, the Court finds the lower courts to have been mistaken and, to a degree, remiss in the performance of their duties.[81]

Second, PO3 Maulas’ account has in its favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, which presumption the prosecution utterly failed to overturn.

In Yap v. Lagtapon,[82] the Court described the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties in this wise:

The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties is an aid to the effective and unhampered administration of government functions. Without such benefit, every official action could be negated with minimal effort from litigants, irrespective of merit or sufficiency of evidence to support such challenge. To this end, our body of jurisprudence has been consistent in requiring nothing short of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary to overthrow such presumption.[83] (Emphasis supplied)

The presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty.[84] Conversely, unless the official act in question is irregular on its face,[85] or where the records suggest that the law enforcers involved deviated from the standard conduct of official duty as provided for in the law,[86] the presumption prevails until it is overcome by no less than clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.[87] Thus, unless the presumption is rebutted, it becomes conclusive.[88]

Here, the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to show any deficiency or irregularity on the part of PO3 Maulas in the performance of his official duty as the traffic investigator of the accident. Also, the prosecution did not show that he was impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely. As such, PO3 Maulas’ investigation report has in its favor the presumption that official duty had regularly been performed,[89] and thus entitled to weight and respect.
 
Notably, the prosecution simply harped on the fact that PO3 Maulas did not actually witness the accident.[90] However, the Court has time and again given weight to the report of the traffic or investigating officer in cases involving vehicular accidents, even if the investigating officer did not actually witness the accident. In Serra v. Mumar,[91] which involved a civil action for damages in relation to a charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, the Court upheld the traffic investigator’s report despite the investigator not having been an actual eyewitness, thus:

Petitioner insists that the traffic investigator SPO3 Haran Abdullatip’s report should be disregarded because he was not at the scene when the accident happened.

Rarely does it happen that the investigating officer personally witnesses an accident that he investigates, yet this does not mean that his observations are not valid. A traffic investigator’s training and experience allow him to determine how an accident occurred even without witnessing the accident himself.

In this case, Abdullatip had been a traffic investigator for nine years. Even if he arrived at the scene after the accident, he saw the vehicles in their relative positions as a result of the accident. His experience, as well as his evaluation of the statements from various witnesses, guided him in assessing who was at fault. In any case, the presumption of regularity in the exercise of functions is in his favor and therefore his report must be given credence.[92] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Similarly, in BJDC Construction v. Lanuzo,[93] which involved a civil action for damages arising from a road accident, the Court upheld the contents of the police officer’s investigation report as it enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of the police officer’s duties. This presumption was upheld by the Court in this case, as no evidence was adduced to show any deficiency or irregularity in the performance of the police officer’s official duty as the police investigator of the accident, and that it was not shown that he was “impelled by any ill motive or bias to testify falsely.”[94]

Meanwhile, in Manuel v. Court of Appeals,[95] which involved a civil action based on quasi-delict, therein petitioners questioned the accuracy of the sketches prepared by the police investigator, as “it was prepared the day after the incident and the alleged ‘tell-tale’ skid marks and other details had already been obliterated by the heavy downpour which lasted for at least an hour after the accident.”[96] The Court, however, rejected this assertion, as the “strong presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty x x x erases, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, any suspicions that the police investigator just invented the skid marks indicated in his report.”[97]

Finally, in Caminos, Jr. v. People[98] (Caminos), the Court even convicted therein accused of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property based on, among others, the entries in the traffic accident investigation report (TAIR) and sketch made by the traffic investigator depicting the post-collision positions of the two vehicles. In convicting therein accused, the Court noted that the “TAIR itself shows that petitioner approached the intersection in excess of lawful speed x x x which raises the presumption of imprudent driving x x x.”[99]

The foregoing principles find utmost relevance here, especially considering that the traffic investigator’s findings, rather than implicate, actually exonerate the accused.

Certainly, in criminal cases, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot, by itself, overcome the superior presumption of innocence.[100] Corollarily, if the official findings actually favor the accused, then such findings, if unrebutted, should inevitably yield the acquittal of the accused. After all, if the “facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his [or her] guilt, then the evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty and will not suffice to support a conviction.”[101] Indeed, while the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot preponderate over the presumption of innocence,[102] which prevails if not overthrown by proof beyond reasonable doubt,[103] with much more reason should this presumption, if unrebutted, be considered “binding truth”[104] in favor of the accused, especially considering that the accused is protected by the overwhelming presumption of innocence.

Third, contrasting the two versions of the incident, the Court finds the version of Renilda incredible, contrary to the findings of the lower courts.

Indeed, as correctly pointed out by PO3 Maulas, had Robles come speeding from Calceta Street and, in doing so, hit Ronelo’s motorcycle which resulted in Ronelo and Renilda getting flung away, then the point of impact should not have been in front of St. Jude Hospital, which is located at the intersection of CPG Avenue and Calceta Street,[105] but rather somewhere further at the middle of the said intersection. In addition, based on the prosecution’s version of the facts, had Robles’s Suzuki Raider motorcycle “hit and bump[ed]”[106] Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton motorcycle, there should likewise have been damage on the front wheel portion of Robles’ motorcycle, and not on its left side where the change pedal is located.

The relative positions of the two vehicles at the point of impact and thereafter, as reflected in PO3 Maulas’ sketch below, likewise lead to the conclusion that Ronelo was the one who hit Robles and was, in fact, driving at a much faster speed.

(image supposed to be here)
 
That Robles and his motorcycle were thrown further to the north (forward into CPG Avenue) would also indicate that Robles had indeed slowed down, while Ronelo, having gained much momentum, was thrown upon impact. Moreover, had Renilda’s version been true, then Ronelo’s Yamaha Crypton should have been flung toward either CPG Avenue or further to the side of Benigno Aquino Avenue, instead of forward into CPG Avenue, as indicated in the sketch.

Even more telling is the fact that the Information itself alleges that Robles was driving “along CPG North Avenue corner Benigno Aquino Avenue,” consistent with PO3 Maulas’ findings. If Robles really came from the east at Calceta Street and crossed through CPG Avenue at the intersection, as claimed by the prosecution, then why was this not alleged in the Information? Indeed, a defective Information which lacks certain essential allegations may still sustain a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial, and the deficiency was cured by competent evidence presented therein.[107] However, that the Information itself contradicts the prosecution’s evidence, and supports the defense’s version of events, as here, further lends to the conclusion that the latter’s account is indeed more consistent with how the events actually transpired. To be sure, that the prosecution presented a version contrary to that stated in the Information undeniably puts in doubt the entire version of the prosecution as to what truthfully happened. As well, it lends credence to the version of the defense as testified to by Robles, PO3 Maulas, and the other defense witnesses.

Accordingly, a thorough reading of the records of the case induces the Court to believe and approve the defense’s version of the incident. In checkered contrast, the Court finds the version of the prosecution doubtful and incongruous with reality.
 

A causal connection between Robles’ negligence and the injuries or damages complained of was not proven beyond reasonable doubt
 
Notwithstanding the obvious gaps in the prosecution’s evidence, the lower courts alternatively hinge Robles’ conviction on their finding that Robles was then driving an unregistered motor vehicle and only had a student driver’s permit without the company of a licensed driver, for which reason, according to the lower courts, he would be presumed to be negligent under Article 2185 of the Civil Code.[108]

Again, the Court disagrees.
 
Gonzaga v. People,[109] and more recently, Ofracio v. People[110] instruct that in order to establish a motorist’s liability for the negligent operation of a vehicle, it must be shown that there was a direct causal connection between such negligence and the injuries or damages complained of.[111] Otherwise stated, mere negligence, presumed or otherwise, does not warrant a conviction under Article 365 of the RPC, as a direct causal connection must additionally be shown between the accused’s negligence and the accident.[112] In the same light, the Court, in Valencia v. People,[113] further held that mere negligence will not suffice because it is the motorist’s willful and wanton act done in utter disregard of the consequence of his or her action, which criminalizes an imprudent or negligent act.[114]

Likewise, Añonuevo v. Court of Appeals[115] clarifies that while the violation of a statute may establish some degree of negligence, pursuant to Article 2185 of the Civil Code, the complainant must nevertheless show that the violation of the statute was the proximate or legal cause of the injury, or that it substantially contributed thereto.[116] After all, negligence consisting in whole or in part, of violation of law, like any other negligence, is without legal consequence unless it is a contributing cause of the injury.[117]

From the foregoing premises, it thus cannot be said that Robles could be presumed negligent, considering that there is no causal connection that could be reasonably drawn between his violations — lack of driver’s license and driving an unregistered vehicle — and the proximate cause of the accident. Additionally, there is also no evidence that the violations even contributed to the accident.

In this connection, the Court notes that the lower courts failed to consider that Robles was, at the time of the mishap, actually accompanied by a back rider in the person of Lopos, a duly licensed driver.[118] In fact, the RTC in the instant case even took judicial notice of the Decision rendered in Crim. Case No. 14906,[119] wherein Robles was acquitted of the criminal offense of driving without a license because he was actually accompanied by Lopos, “a duly licensed driver.”[120] Hence, that Robles only had a student driver’s permit could not at the onset give rise to a presumption that he was negligent, considering that the Traffic Code explicitly allows a student driver to operate a motor vehicle when accompanied by a duly licensed driver.[121]

The foregoing discussions point to no other conclusion than that Robles is not guilty of the crime charged and should consequently be acquitted.
 

Robles’ conviction may not be sustained based on an alternative set of facts not supported by the prosecution’s evidence
 
Finally, to support Robles’ conviction, the CA nonetheless holds that even if Robles’ version were to be believed, he nevertheless should have complied with Section 45(b) of the Traffic Code, which necessitated that he correctly positioned himself “nearest to the center line of the highway” prior to making a left turn,[122] and that he be on the proper lookout for incoming vehicles.[123] “Had he done so,” the CA concludes, “he could have seen the fast speeding motorcycle behind which x x x according to him, attempted to overtake him.”[124] Thus, the CA finds Robles guilty of the crime charged as “had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened.”[125]

Again, the Court disagrees.

Notably, the bulk of the CA’s assailed Decision was centered on justifying Robles’ conviction, if his claim “will be believed that he was also cruising along CPG Avenue when he was hit by the motorcycle driven by Solas on his left side.”[126] It did not, at all, touch on why Robles should be convicted based on the facts as actually presented by the prosecution.

On this score, the CA obviously overlooked that under the defense’s version of the incident: (1) both parties were approaching the intersection from the same direction, (2) thereafter, Robles signaled his intention to turn left, (3) Ronelo, meanwhile, was speeding in his attempt to overtake Robles, and (4) such attempt on the part of Ronelo to overtake caused the collision. Likewise on record is Dr. de los Santos’ testimony finding Ronelo to have been “intoxicated” at the time of this accident.[127] Given these alternative set of facts, it cannot simply be concluded that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have occurred. These are just speculations. There are various other factors at play in a vehicular accident, as here, such as the relative distances and speeds of the two vehicles in their approach of the intersection — which, for obvious reasons, the prosecution, in this case, had not been able to address under the said “alternative” version of the facts.

On this point, the Court’s ruling in Ladeco v. Angala,[128] finds relevance. In that case, a pick-up truck running along the outer lane was slowing down to about five to 10 kilometers per hour (kph) and was making a left turn preparatory to turning south, or a U-turn, when it was bumped from behind by the crewcab which was running along the inner lane at around 60 to 70 kph. Interestingly, the owner of the crewcab alleged therein, as the CA holds in the present case, that the driver of the pick-up did not take the proper lane before executing the U-turn, in violation of Section 45(b) of Traffic Code and hence, it was the latter’s recklessness that was the proximate cause of the accident. The Court, disagreeing with the CA, held that the parties were both negligent, as while the pick-up truck was not in the correct lane, the accident would not have happened if the driver of the crewcab was not driving very fast. The Court went further to say that the crewcab, based on the doctrine of last clear chance, was ultimately at fault. Said the Court:

Since both parties are at fault in this case, the doctrine of last clear chance applies.

The doctrine of last clear chance states that where both parties are negligent but the negligent act of one is appreciably later than that of the other, or where it is impossible to determine whose fault or negligence caused the loss, the one who had the last clear opportunity to avoid the loss but failed to do so is chargeable with the loss. In this case, Deocampo had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. Since Deocampo was driving the rear vehicle, he had full control of the situation since he was in a position to observe the vehicle in front of him. Deocampo had the responsibility of avoiding bumping the vehicle in front of him. A U-turn is done at a much slower speed to avoid skidding and overturning, compared to running straight ahead. Deocampo could have avoided the vehicle if he was not driving very fast while following the pick-up. Deocampo was not only driving fast, he also admitted that he did not step on the brakes even upon seeing the pick-up. He only stepped on the brakes after the collision.[129] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Further, in Caminos, the Court likewise clarified that the right of way rule,[130] as stated in Section 42 of the Traffic Code,[131] is applicable in instances where two colliding vehicles are approaching the intersection at approximately the same time.

In Caminos, the Court held that whether one of the drivers has the right of way or, as sometimes stated, has the status of a favored driver on the highway, is a question that permeates a situation where the vehicles approach the crossing so nearly at the same time and at such distances and speed that if either of them proceeds without regard to the other a collision is likely to occur.[132] Nevertheless, the right of way accorded to vehicles approaching an intersection is by no means a legal straitjacket, and is subject to and is affected by the relative distances of the vehicles from the point of intersection, and their respective speeds.[133] Notably, the Court here declared that “it is much unsafe as it is unjust to assume”[134] that the one making a left turn had performed a risky maneuver at the intersection in simply “failing to keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles.“[135]

Likewise, in Adzuara v. Court of Appeals,[136] a criminal case involving reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with less serious physical injuries, it was established that a motorist crossing a through stop street has the right of way over the one making a turn; but if the person making the turn has already negotiated half of the turn and is almost on the other side so that he or she is already visible to the person on the through street, the latter, having the last clear chance to avoid the accident, is bound to give way to the former.[137]

In sum, a motorist’s liability for a road accident is not determined simply by who among the parties had the right of way or was in the proper lane. Rather, the same is determined by various factors, which include, among others, the relative distances and respective speeds of the vehicles,[138] or who among the parties had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.[139]

To stress, here, the prosecution, and later the lower courts, proceeded on the theory that Robles came from Calceta Street, and not CPG Avenue. As such, the prosecution did not, at all, present any evidence as to the speed and distance of Robles relative to Ronelo, had Robles come from CPG Avenue, and whether such directly caused, or at least materially contributed to, the injuries or damages complained of. Thus, the CA erred in justifying Robles’ conviction based simply on the alternative speculative theory that had Robles been in the correct position on the road, the mishap would not have happened.[140] This undoubtedly does not satisfy the core requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt.

To be sure, in a prosecution for reckless driving, the contributory negligence of the person who was injured or who was the driver of the motor vehicle with which the accused’s vehicle collided does not constitute a complete defense.[141] However, it is likewise true that a conviction must rest on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence, and not on the weakness — or in this case, the strength — of the defense.[142]

All told, the prosecution failed to establish that Robles committed the act and ultimately, the crime, for which he is being charged. The prosecution likewise neither established that Robles committed inexcusable lack of precaution in driving his motorcycle, nor proved that his alleged negligence was the legal cause of the injury complained of.

Based on the abovementioned premises, the Court is likewise unable to sustain the award of damages in favor of Renilda, Carmelino, and the heirs of Ronelo, considering that the prosecution failed to prove that Robles committed the act complained of.[143] On this score, the Court also notes that Robles submitted before this Court[144] affidavits of desistance respectively executed by Renilda[145] and Carmelino,[146] wherein both of them waived their respective claims for damages and indemnity against Robles.[147]

WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. CEB-CR No. 02067 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Michael John Robles is hereby ACQUITTED for failure of the prosecution to prove that he committed the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt. If detained, he is ordered immediately RELEASED, unless he is confined for any other lawful cause. Any amount paid by way of a bailbond is ordered RETURNED. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately.

SO ORDERED.

HEIRS OF KUKUNGAN TIMBAO, REPRESENTED BY MUSA TIMBAO, HALIMA TIMBAO ANDANG, FATIMA TIMBAO ISMAEL, OMAR TIMBAO, AND ZUBAINA TIMBAO ATOG, PETITIONERS, VS. OSCAR D. ENOJADO, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



GESMUNDO, C.J.:
This is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the February 9, 2011[2] and December 6, 2011[3] Resolutions of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 02203-MIN which denied due course and dismissed the appeal of the Heirs of Kukungan Timbao, represented by Musa Timbao, Halima Timbao Andang, Fatima Timbao Ismael, Omar Timbao, and Zubaina Timbao Atog (petitioners), for failure to file the required Appellant’s Brief under Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.


Petitioners, all Muslim-Filipinos and claiming to be members of the National Cultural Communities of the Philippines, filed a complaint for recovery of ownership, possession and damages, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction (WPI), and receivership against Oscar D. Enojado (respondent) before the Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, Branch 23 (RTC) which was docketed as Civil Case No. 7623. They alleged that their deceased father, Kukungan Timbao (Timbao), was the owner, possessor, and occupant of a 5.25-hectare agricultural land located at Purok Abtalael, Barangay San Isidro, General Santos City and covered by Plan PSU-179955. However, during the Ilaga-Blackshirt conflicts in the 1970s, their father and the members of his family were forced to vacate the said ancestral land. Since the evacuation and after their father’s death, a certain Felix Enojado (Felix) gained possession over the subject agricultural land.[4]
When relative peace was re-established in the area, petitioners wanted to return to the subject property, but Felix and his wife, Rosario Enojado (Rosario), informed them that the same was already registered in the name of their son, herein respondent, under OCT No. P-2887.[5]

Petitioners thus filed a civil action for recovery of ownership and possession against respondent, claiming that: 1) the certificate of title is null and void because respondent was still a minor in 1974 when he applied for free patent; 2) the parcel of land is an ancestral land which petitioners inherited from their father; 3) petitioners, as members of a cultural minority, did not convey the contested realty to respondent; and 4) the title issued to respondent violated paragraph 1 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 152,[6] and therefore null and void.[7]

Respondent, on the other hand, admitted that he was a minor at the time of his application for free patent and that Timbao was the original owner, possessor, and occupant of the subject property. He countered, among others, that: 1) petitioners’ action for recovery has already prescribed because the title issued to him had become indefeasible; 2) petitioners are estopped from questioning the transfer of property since their father had validly sold the same to his mother, Rosario; and 3) after such transfer, Rosario executed an Affidavit of Waiver of Rights over the said realty in his favor.[8]



In its March 14, 2008 Order,[9] the RTC dismissed the complaint, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, finding the affirmative defenses of the defendants to have been duly proved and with merit, this case is hereby ordered DISMISSED. There being no evidence presented to prove the counterclaims of the defendant, the same is also DISMISSED.

SO ORDERED.[10]

The RTC ruled that respondent had duly proven that: 1) the subject property was sold by petitioners’ parents to Rosario based on a Transfer of Rights and Sale of Improvements; and 2) that Rosario executed an Affidavit of Waiver of Rights covering the said realty in respondent’s favor.[11] It also held that the heirs’ rights and action to recover ownership and possession of the subject property had already prescribed since the Torrens title issued on the basis of the free patent had become indefeasible and incontrovertible one year after its issuance and registration.[12]

Aggrieved by the said order, petitioners appealed before the CA.



In its February 9, 2011 Resolution, the CA denied due course and dismissed petitioners’ appeal for failure to file an Appellant’s Brief. The CA disposed:
In view of the Judicial Records Division (JRD) verification report dated February 1, 2011 that no Appellant’s Brief has yet been filed by plaintiffs-appellants, the instant appeal is DENIED DUE COURSE and is hereby DISMISSED pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Revised Rules of Court.

SO ORDERED.[13]

On Motion for Reconsideration,[14] petitioners claimed to have filed their Appellant’s Brief through registered mail. They averred that their counsel had filed the said pleading through registered mail as shown by Registry Receipt No. 1000.[15] To prove their filing, petitioners submitted a photocopy of an Affidavit of Service for the said pleading where pasted at the bottom was the said registry receipt.[16] In its December 6, 2011 Resolution, the CA denied petitioners’ motion after finding that they do not have said pleading on file. It also faulted petitioners for failing to ensure that the CA had received their pleading, and to submit, albeit belatedly or at least simultaneously with their motion for reconsideration, a copy of their Appellants’ Brief.[17]



Undaunted, petitioners now seek relief before the Court via a Petition for Certiorari, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA for dismissing their appeal based on a technicality. They likewise assail the validity of the free patent issued to respondent, contending that it was void because respondent was then a minor and did not reside in the contested realty.[18]
By way of Comment,[19] respondent posits that petitioners chose a wrong remedy, having filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 instead of a petition for review under Rule 45. He contends that assuming the CA had indeed erred in dismissing petitioners’ appeal and denying their motion for reconsideration, it merely committed an error of judgment which is not correctible by certiorari.[20] Petitioners also did not attach a certification from the Office of the Postmaster of Tacurong City to prove that they had deposited a copy of the Appellants’ Brief with the post office.[21]

In their Reply,[22] petitioners insist on the correctness of their remedy, and maintain that the CA should have been more considerate and, should have instead, required them to re-submit their brief which was unfortunately lost by the Post Office of Tacurong City.[23] Since the loss of the pleading was beyond their control, petitioners opine that the CA acted with grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed their appeal.[24]



The petition is partly meritorious.
 
The CA may dismiss an appeal for failure to serve and file an appellant’s brief; Petitioners failed to prove filing of the Appellants’ Brief to the CA.
 
It must be stated at the outset that the right to appeal is neither a natural right nor a part of due process. It is merely a statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of law.[25] One who seeks to avail of the right to appeal must comply strictly with the requirements of the rules, otherwise, it often leads to the loss of such right.[26]

Except when a record of appeal is required, Sec. 3,[27] Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (1997 Rules) provides that an ordinary appeal from the RTC shall be taken within 15 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. Upon the perfection of appeal, it is the duty of the clerk of court to verify the correctness and completeness of the records that will be transmitted to the appellate court.[28] The appellant is thereafter duty-bound to file seven copies of the appellant’s brief with the court, within 45 days from receipt of the notice of the clerk that all the evidence, oral and documentary, are attached to the record, with proof of service of two copies thereof upon the appellee.[29]

On the other hand, Sec. 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules authorizes the CA to dismiss the appeal, motu proprio or upon motion of the appellee, for failure of the appellant to serve and file the appellant’s brief within the reglementary period. Pertinently, filing and service of pleadings refer to two different acts. Sec. 2, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules defines filing as the act of presenting the pleading or other paper to the clerk of court. On the other hand, service is the act of providing a party with a copy of the pleading or paper concerned. Although they pertain to different acts, filing and service go hand-in-hand and must be considered together when determining whether the pleading, motion, or any other paper was filed within the applicable reglementary period.[30]

Corollary, Sec. 12, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules states that the filing of the pleading shall be proved in the following manner:

Section 12. Proof of filing. — The filing of a pleading or paper shall be proved by its existence in the record of the case. If it is not in the record, but is claimed to have been filed personally, the filing shall be proved by the written or stamped acknowledgment of its filing by the clerk of court on a copy of the same; if filed by registered mail, by the registry receipt and by the affidavit of the person who did the mailing, containing a full statement of the date and place of depositing the mail in the post office in a sealed envelope addressed to the court, with postage fully prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after ten (10) days if not delivered. (Emphases supplied)

Principally, a pleading is deemed filed if the same exists in the records of the case. Otherwise, it may be proved depending on the manner by which it was filed. If filing was done personally, it may be proved through the acknowledgment made by the clerk of court on the party’s receiving copy. However, in the case of filing by registered mail, two documents should be presented to prove the same: (1) the registry receipt and (2) the affidavit of the person who mailed the pleading. Sec. 12 also specifically enumerates the required contents of the said affidavit: a full statement of the date and place of depositing the mail in the post office in a sealed envelope addressed to the court, with postage fully prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after 10 days if not delivered.

The Court agrees with the CA that there was no such pleading in their records. Nonetheless, petitioners have been consistent in claiming that they filed their Appellants’ Brief by registered mail. Pursuant to Sec. 12, they are burdened to prove such filing by presenting a copy of the registry receipt and the affidavit of the person who mailed the said pleading. Unfortunately, they failed to discharge their burden.

While petitioners were able to submit a copy of Registry Receipt No. 1000 which was purportedly issued by the post office when they deposited a copy of their Appellants’ Brief intended for the CA, they however have failed to submit an affidavit pursuant to Sec. 12. A simple perusal of the affidavit they attached to their motion would reveal that it pertained to the service of the pleading to respondent, and not its filing with the CA. Patently, this is not the affidavit contemplated by Sec. 12.

Moreover, the distinction between the act of filing and service would move this Court to rule that the submission of the said affidavit does not amount to substantial compliance with Sec. 12. To reiterate, petitioners are bound to prove that they filed their appellants’ brief by depositing the same in a sealed envelope addressed to the CA, instead of their service of the pleading to respondent. However, petitioners’ affidavit only proved their service of the subject pleading to respondent, and not the filing of the same to the CA. In this regard, the CA had sufficient basis to dismiss petitioners’ appeal and subsequently deny their motion for reconsideration.
 

Certiorari shall lie against the CA for instantly dismissing petitioners’ appeal.
 
Regardless of petitioners’ failure to meet the conditions under Sec. 12 of Rule 13, the Court agrees with them that the CA gravely abused its discretion in dismissing their appeal.

To recall, petitioners seek recourse to this Court pursuant to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, Sec. 1 of which states:

Section 1. Petition for certiorari. — When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annul ling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.

Evidently, the party filing a petition for certiorari must not merely allege, but be able to prove that the concerned court or tribunal acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. In National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation v. Tarobal,[31] the Court ruled that:

The doctrine is that certiorari will issue only to correct errors of jurisdiction and that no error or mistake committed by a court will be corrected by certiorari unless said court acted without jurisdiction or in excess thereof or with such grave abuse of discretion as would amount to lack of jurisdiction. The writ is available only for these purposes and not to correct errors of procedure or mistake in the findings or conclusions of the judge. It is strictly confined to the determination of the propriety of the trial court’s jurisdiction whether it has jurisdiction over the case and if so, whether the exercise of its jurisdiction has or has not been attended by grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[32]

Alquiza v. Alquiza[33] explained that the appellate court exercises not only judgment, but most importantly, discretion when it decides to dismiss an appeal based on failure of the appellant to file a brief or to explain such failure.[34] In employing such discretion, the appellate court shall consider the circumstances obtaining in the case, particularly, the demands of substantial justice. If an appeal has been dismissed, the appellate court also has sufficient discretion to reinstate the same, provided, there is good and sufficient cause obtaining in the case:

Granting that the power or discretion to reinstate an appeal that had been dismissed is included in or implied from the power or discretion to dismiss an appeal, still such power or discretion must be exercised upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, in like manner as the power or discretion vested in the appellate court to allow extensions of time for the filing of briefs. There must be such a showing which would call for, prompt and justify its exercise. Otherwise, it cannot and must not be upheld.[35]

Petitioners have constantly insisted having filed their brief through registered mail, which they now claim to have been lost.[36] They likewise point to the Affidavit of Proof of Service and Registry Receipt No. 1000 to prove that they indeed submitted the subject pleading.

To resolve this matter, the Court has no recourse but to go over the records and lay down the timeline related to the filing, or non-filing, of the subject brief.

On July 23, 2010, the CA, thru its Judicial Records Division, required the parties to submit their respective briefs within the reglementary period as provided by Secs. 7 to 9, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules.[37] On September 15, 2010, petitioners’ counsel filed a Motion for Extension[38] of 30 days from the initial deadline of September 16, 2010, or until October 16, 2010, within which to file the appellants’ brief.

It appears that on December 29, 2010,[39] the CA received respondent’s Appellee’s Brief dated December 17, 2010. In paragraph 1 of the said Brief, respondent alleged that “[t]he statement of facts and case made by plaintiffs­-appellants in their brief is so inaccurate and unsupported by the records of the case x x x.”[40]

On February 1, 2011, the Judicial Records Division submitted a Verification Report[41] stating that “No appellant’s brief filed per docket book entry as of 2/1/11.” For this reason, the CA was constrained to dismiss the appeal on February 9, 2011 pursuant to Sec. 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules. Petitioners’ counsel received a copy of the said resolution on February 22, 2011.[42] Two days thereafter, or on February 24, 2011, petitioners filed their “Motion for Reconsideration of Resolution, dated February 9, 2011”[43] and averred that they had duly filed their appellants’ brief via registered mail on October 13, 2010 to which the post office issued Registry Receipt No. 1000. Petitioners submitted, as proof, a photocopy of the purported Affidavit of Proof of Service which appears to have been attached to their appellants’ brief. A close examination of the affidavit would reveal that at the bottom portion thereof appears to be a photocopy of Registry Receipt No. 1000.[44]

Instead of resolving the motion for reconsideration, the CA issued a Resolution[45] dated June 13, 2011, which directed respondent to file his comment or opposition to said motion. Respondent complied by filing a Comment[46] which contained the following averments:

On October 21, 2020, defendant-appellee received a copy of plaintiffs-appellants’ Brief which was sent by registered mail on October 13, 2010.
On December 17, 2010, defendant-appellee filed his brief by registered mail.
However, defendant-appellee is not certain whether plaintiffs-appellants had filed their Brief in the Court of Appeals.
 
3.1
If the record in the above-entitled case shows that indeed plaintiffs-appellants had filed their Brief, then the motion for reconsideration should be granted and this case be decided on the merits.
3.2
However, if the record in the above-entitled case does not show that indeed plaintiffs-appellants had filed their Brief, then plaintiffs-appellants must be required to submit to this Court the Registry Return Card of Registry Receipt No. 1000 in order to determine whether plaintiffs-appellants’ Brief was really filed in this Court or not.[47]
The CA noted respondent’s Comment,[48] and two months thereafter, issued the now assailed Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration, holding as follows:

In this case, there is no Appellant’s Brief actually on file. Plaintiffs-appellants failed to exert effort to see to it that their brief was received by the Court of Appeals. Besides, plaintiffs-appellants did not even file their brief, albeit belatedly, but at least simultaneously with their motion for reconsideration.[49]

Based on the above chronology of the events, it is not difficult to discern why the CA resolved to dismiss petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.

Firstly, the CA merely followed the letter of Sec. 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules which grants it the authority to dismiss an appeal for failure to file and serve the appellant’s brief.[50]

Secondly, as previously discussed, petitioners failed to sufficiently demonstrate that they filed the requisite pleading by complying with Sec. 12 of Rule 13.

Lastly, the CA pointed out that despite the months that had passed before it issued the challenged Resolution, petitioners did not bother to file or re-submit, even belatedly, a copy of their Appellants’ Brief.

The CA aptly emphasized that petitioners should have exercised diligence and exerted efforts in ascertaining that it has properly received the document they filed by registered mail. Due diligence in filing the required pleading does not end with the mere deposit of the same to the post office for mailing, most especially in this case, where petitioners have been apprised of the fact of non receipt by the CA. This Court is even perplexed as to why petitioners’ counsel chose to be stubborn and insist that they had filed the brief instead of simply furnishing the CA with another copy thereof. Such would have changed the course of this case, as the CA could have judiciously exercised its discretion by admitting petitioners’ brief, and eventually decide the same based on the merits.

Notwithstanding the authority granted by Sec. 1(e) of Rule 50, as well as the circumstances which convinced the CA to dismiss petitioners’ appeal, the Court holds that it committed grave abuse of discretion in doing so.

The dismissal of an appeal based on failure to file an appellant’s brief should be guided by the principles laid down in The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium v. Court of Appeals[51] (The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium), to wit:

(1)
The general rule is for the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal when no appellant’s brief is filed within the reglementary period prescribed by the rules;
(2)
The power conferred upon the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal is discretionary and directory and not ministerial or mandatory;
(3)
The failure of an appellant to file his brief within the reglementary period does not have the effect of causing the automatic dismissal of the appeal;
(4)
In case of late filing, the appellate court has the power to still allow the appeal; however, for the proper exercise of the court’s leniency it is imperative that:
(a)
the circumstances obtaining warrant the court’s liberality;
(b)
that strong considerations of equity justify an exception to the procedural rule in the interest of substantial justice;
(c)
no material injury has been suffered by the appellee by the delay;
(d)
there is no contention that the appellees’ cause was prejudiced;
(e)
at least there is no motion to dismiss filed.
(5)
In case of delay, the lapse must be for a reasonable period; and
(6)
Inadvertence of counsel cannot be considered as an adequate excuse as to call for the appellate court’s indulgence except:
(a)
where the reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law;
(b)
when application of the rule will result in outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property; or
(c)
where the interests of justice so require.[52] (Emphases supplied)
Clearly, the CA exercises discretionary power to dismiss an appeal when an appellant’s brief has not been timely filed. Based on the same discretion, the CA may allow the belated filing of the appellant’s brief, as long as: (1) it is duly warranted by the circumstances; (2) there appears to be strong considerations of equity in the interest of substantial justice; (3) the appellee will not suffer any material injury caused by the delay; (4) there is no contention that the appellees’ cause was prejudiced; or (5) the respondent did not file any motion to dismiss.

The circumstances obtaining before the CA provide sufficient basis to allow a belated submission of the appellants’ brief.

Foremost, the CA failed to notice that respondent admitted in his Comment that he received a copy of the appellants’ brief on October 21, 2010. Said pleading was sent by registered mail on October 13, 2010.[53] It is worth noting that the date of the registered mail coincides with the date appearing on Registry Receipt No. 1000 which petitioners claim to have been issued by the post office for the appellants’ brief intended for the CA. Also, the date of the mailing was done before October 16, 2010, the last day of the extension prayed for by petitioners.

More importantly, the CA failed to consider the fact that respondent was able to file an Appellee’s Brief which, under Sec. 8, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules, shall be filed within 45 days from receipt of the appellant’s brief. Respondent’s filing of the appellee’s brief sufficiently indicates that petitioners have properly served upon him a copy of the appellants’ brief. Else stated, respondent could not have drafted and filed his brief if he was not furnished a copy of the appellants’ brief.

With the service of the appellants’ brief to respondent, it would be absurd to presume that petitioners did not file the same. To reiterate, filing and service go hand-in-hand and must be considered together in determining whether the pleading was filed.[54]

Furthermore, respondent did not appear to have been prejudiced or suffered material injury by virtue of the non-filing of the appellants’ brief. The Court even finds as commendable, respondent’s candor and sense of fairness, when he admitted receiving appellants’ brief and even provided the date when it was sent through registered mail. He even exhorted the CA to require petitioners to submit the registry return card to determine whether they have indeed made the requisite filing.[55]

Indeed, the Court has ruled that the failure to file an appellant’s brief, although not jurisdictional, results in the abandonment of the appeal which may be the cause for its dismissal.[56] However, The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium recognizes that failure to timely file the appellant’s brief is not a cause for automatic dismissal of the appeal, and that the CA has discretionary authority to allow its belated filing when warranted.

It is well-established that rules of procedure, especially those prescribing the time within which certain acts must be done, are absolutely indispensable to the prevention of needless delays and to the orderly and speedy discharge of business. Procedural rules are tools meant to facilitate the adjudication of cases. They may be relaxed, but such relaxation in the interest of justice was never intended to be a license for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity.[57] The Court will not hesitate to be liberal in its interpretation and application of the rules, but only under the most exceptional circumstances.

Indubitably, the instant case is not one that should receive a strict application of the rules. Although petitioners may be faulted for their shortcomings, the preceding circumstances may be considered in determining whether they were remiss in filing the required pleading. These should have prompted the CA to observe more prudence in treating petitioners’ appeal, by simply requiring the latter to submit their appellants’ brief. For such lack of prudence, the CA had, lamentably, gravely abused its discretion.

The finding of grave abuse of discretion by the CA would have resulted in remanding this case to provide the latter an opportunity to resolve it based on the merits. However, to save time and in the interest of justice, the Court finds it proper to resolve the instant case.
 

Sec. 44 of Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 141[58] does not require the applicant to be of legal age and an actual resident of the land subject of the free patent application.
 
Petitioners argue in the main that a free patent cannot be validly issued on the contested land in favor of a minor who did not reside thereon.

The Court is not persuaded. While respondent may have been a minor at the time the free patent was issued to him, there appears to be no legal impediment in the issuance of such title.

The requirements for filing an application for free patent are laid down by Sec. 44 of CA No. 141 which originally provides that:

Section 44. Any natural-born citizen of the Philippines who since July fourth, nineteen hundred and twenty-six or prior thereto, has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, a tract or tracts of agricultural public lands subject to disposition, or who shall have paid the real estate tax thereon while the same has not been occupied by any person shall be entitled, under the provisions of this chapter, to have a free patent issued to him for such tract or tracts of such land not to exceed twenty-four hectares.

Clear from Sec. 44 that there were only two requirements that must be satisfied in filing an application for a free patent: (1) that the applicant is natural-born citizen of the Philippines; and (2) that since July 4, 1926, the applicant or his/her predecessors-in-interest have continuously occupied and cultivated the public agricultural land, or have paid real estate tax thereon.

At the time that respondent was granted a free patent, Sec. 44 was amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3872.[59] However, R.A. No. 3872 only introduced an additional paragraph to Sec. 44 which read as follows:

Section 44. x x x

A member of the national cultural minorities who has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-­interest, a tract or tracts of land, whether disposable or not since July 4, 1955, shall be entitled to the right granted in the preceding paragraph of this section: Provided, That at the time he files his free patent application he is not the owner of any real estate secured or disposable under this provision of the Public Land Law.

Several decades thereafter, the first paragraph of Sec. 44 was further amended by R.A. No. 6940.[60] Still, Sec. 44 does not provide for an age limit to applicants of free patent as the amendment introduced by R.A. No. 6940 reads as follows:

Sec. 44. Any natural-born citizen of the Philippines who is not the owner of more than twelve (12) hectares and who, for at least thirty (30) years prior to the effectivity of this amendatory Act, has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in­-interest a tract or tracts of agricultural public lands subject to disposition, who shall have paid the real estate tax thereon while the same has not been occupied by any person shall be entitled, under the provisions of this Chapter, to have a free patent issued to him for such tract or tracts of such land not to exceed twelve (12) hectares.

Verily, applications for free patent, whether it be under the original text of Sec. 44 or its amendments, do not provide for age limitations unlike in the other provisions in CA No. 141.[61] Hence, petitioners’ challenge against the free patent issued to respondent while he was a minor lacks legal support.

As regards the contention that respondent was not residing on the subject property which invalidates the free patent issued to him, again, petitioners are mistaken.

Aside from citizenship, Sec. 44 only requires continuous occupation and cultivation of the land either by the applicant or through the predecessors-in-interest. “Occupation” is not the same as “residence.” Occupation is not even synonymous with “possession,” the latter being broader in scope while the former delimits the all-encompassing effect of constructive possession.[62] Residence, in civil actions, refers to a place of abode, whether permanent or temporary, and differs from domicile which denotes a fixed permanent residence to which when there is absence, one has the intention of returning.[63]

Accordingly, the term “occupation and cultivation” as used in Sec. 44 does not refer to residence. Occupation and cultivation of the realty for the prescribed period grants an individual with a right to apply for a free patent under CA No. 141.[64]

It is basic rule in statutory construction that where the law does not distinguish, neither should the Court.[65] Sec. 44 of CA No. 141 did not lay down any qualification as to the age and residence of the free patent applicant. Hence, petitioners’ insistence to annul respondent’s title is devoid of any legal basis.
 

Respondent’s free patent has become indefeasible; The action for reconveyance has already prescribed.
 
It is settled that once a patent is registered and the corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land covered by it ceases to be part of the public domain and becomes private property, and the Torrens Title issued pursuant to the patent becomes indefeasible upon the expiration of one year from the date of issuance of such patent.[66] Thereafter, the remaining remedy is to file an action for reconveyance. However, an action for reconveyance and cancellation of title prescribes in 10 years from the time of the issuance of the Torrens title over the property.[67]

In the case at bench, respondent’s title, Free Patent No. 557040, was issued on January 25, 1974, and registered with the Office of the Register of Deeds in General Santos City on April 18, 1974.[68] Evidently, the free patent issued to respondent had already become indefeasible after the expiration of one year from the date its issuance.

Thus, when petitioners filed their complaint on August 28, 2006,[69] or 32 years after the issuance of the free patent, the latter was already incontrovertible. Consequently, petitioners’ action for recovery of ownership has been barred by prescription.
 

Petitioners failed to prove that the subject property was reserved and declared as an ancestral land.
 
Finally, petitioners insist that the subject property is a private ancestral land and therefore not part of public land which can be disposed by virtue of a free patent. For this reason, respondent’s free patent is null and void.[70]

Again, the argument lacks merit.

It is worth noting that petitioners had consistently relied and anchored their claims on CA No. 141, as well as P.D. No. 152, which amended certain provisions of CA No. 141, despite the effectivity of R.A. No. 8371[71] or “The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997” (IPRA) at the time they filed their complaint.[72] The IPRA specifically governs the rights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands and domains.[73] The IPRA defines ancestral lands, as follows:

SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. – x x x

x x x x

b) Ancestral Lands – Subject to Section 56 hereof, [refer to lands] occupied, possessed and utilized by individuals, families and clans who are members of the ICCs/IPs since time immemorial, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, under claims of individual or traditional group ownership, continuously, to the present except when interrupted by war, force majeure or displacement by force, deceit, stealth, or as a consequence of government projects and other voluntary dealings entered into by government and private individuals/corporations including, but not limited to, residential lots, rice terraces or paddies, private forests, swidden farms and tree lots; x x x.

At any rate, any person seeking relief under CA No. 141 admits that the property being applied for is public land.[74] CA No. 141 or the Public Land Act allows the disposition of public lands through confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles, which may be done either judicially or through the issuance of a free patent.[75] The second paragraph of Sec. 44 of CA No. 141, as amended by R.A. No. 3872, even expressly provides that indigenous peoples may apply for free patent over such realty which they have continuously cultivated and occupied since July 4, 1955.

Relatedly, Chapter III, Sec. 12[76] of the IPRA and its Implementing Rules and Regulations[77] even expressly provide for an option to secure a certificate of title under CA No. 141, as amended, over individually-owned ancestral lands which are classified as alienable and disposable agricultural lands. Thus, petitioners’ insistence that the subject realty is not part of disposable public land, but a private ancestral land, does not hold water.

Additionally, under Sec. 84 of CA No. 141, lands possessed by indigenous peoples[78] will have to be declared by the President through a proclamation, as reserved for their exclusive use. The same may also be granted to them individually, by virtue of a title or gratuitous patent, and which cannot be more than four hectares. Similarly, the rights of indigenous peoples over their ancestral lands may be formally recognized under the IPRA, through the issuance of certificates of ancestral land titles (CALT).[79] Proofs of claims to ancestral lands include the testimony under oath of elders of the community and other documents directly or indirectly attesting to the possession or occupation of the areas since time immemorial by the individual or corporate claimants in the concept of owners which shall be any of the authentic documents enumerated under Sec. 52(d) of the IPRA Law, including tax declarations and proofs of payment of taxes,[80] such as:

1)
Written accounts of the ICCs/IPs customs and traditions;
2)
Written accounts of the ICCs/IPs political structure and institution;
3)
Pictures showing long term occupation such as those of old improvements, burial grounds, sacred places and old villages;
4)
Historical accounts, including pacts and agreements concerning boundaries entered into by the ICCs/IPs concerned with other ICCs/IPs;
5)
Survey plans and sketch maps;
6)
Anthropological data;
7)
Genealogical surveys;
8)
Pictures and descriptive histories of traditional communal forests and hunting grounds;
9)
Pictures and descriptive histories of traditional landmarks such as mountains, rivers, creeks, ridges, hills, terraces and the like; and
10)
Write-ups of names and places derived from the native dialect of the community.[81]
In Lamsis v. Dong-e,[82] the Court ruled that the application for the issuance of a CALT is akin to a registration proceeding. Thus, titling does not vest ownership upon the applicant but only recognizes ownership that has already vested in the applicant by virtue of his and his predecessor-in-­interest’s possession of the property since time immemorial.[83] Although it is settled that certificates of title are not conclusive evidence of ownership, it is however the best proof of ownership of a piece of land.

In here, there was no indication of any kind that the subject parcel of land had been previously reserved and proclaimed as ancestral land. Neither was it shown that at the very least, an application for ancestral land claim was filed over the same. Apart from their bare allegations, petitioners did not offer any other proof to support their claim that the subject property was indeed an ancestral land.

In sum, petitioners failed to present proof that they possess the requisite right to reconveyance and possession of the subject realty. Hence, while the CA was found to have gravely abused its discretion when it instantly dismissed their appeal for failure to file their Appellants’ Brief, the Court still affirms the dismissal of their appeal for being unmeritorious.
 

Petitioners are not entitled to a TRO and/or WPI.
 
Provisional or ancillary remedies serve to protect actual existing rights and maintain the status quo of things. A TRO and a WPI both constitute temporary measures availed of during the pendency of the action. They are, by nature, ancillary because they are mere incidents in and are dependent upon the result of the main action.[84] They are preservative remedies for the protection of substantive rights or interests, and, hence, not a cause of action in itself, but merely adjunct to a main suit.[85]

The grant or denial of a TRO or an injunctive writ rests on the sound discretion of the court taking cognizance of the case, since the assessment and evaluation of evidence towards that end involves findings of facts left to the said court for its conclusive determination.[86] The issuance thereof is considered an extraordinary or transcendent remedy and a strong arm of equity. As such, the power to issue a writ is done with utmost caution, prudence, and deliberation, and should be exercised reasonably and sparingly only in exceptional circumstances.[87] In every application for provisional injunctive relief, the applicant must establish the actual and existing right sought to be protected. The applicant must also establish the urgency of a writ’s issuance to prevent grave and irreparable injury. Failure to do so will warrant the court’s denial of the application,[88] as in this case.

Petitioners need not substantiate their claim with complete and conclusive evidence since only prima facie evidence or a sampling is required “to give the court an idea of the justification for the preliminary injunction pending the decision of the case on the merits.”[89] However, their bare allegations in this petition were insufficient to warrant the issuance of a TRO or WPI. In view of their unsubstantiated claims and the lack of merit of the instant petition, their prayer for such reliefs must perforce be denied.

WHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying due course to and dismissing petitioners’ appeal based on technicality.

The Resolutions dated February 9, 2011 and December 6, 2011 by the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CV No. 02203-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that petitioners’ appeal is GIVEN DUE COURSE, but the same is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

The urgent prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction is hereby DENIED.

SO ORDERED.

Hernando, Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","Petitioners, all Muslim-Filipinos and claiming to be members of the National Cultural Communities of the Philippines, filed a complaint for recovery of ownership, possession and damages, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction (WPI), and receivership against Oscar D. Enojado (respondent) before the Regional Trial Court of General Santos City, Branch 23 (RTC) which was docketed as Civil Case No. 7623. They alleged that their deceased father, Kukungan Timbao (Timbao), was the owner, possessor, and occupant of a 5.25-hectare agricultural land located at Purok Abtalael, Barangay San Isidro, General Santos City and covered by Plan PSU-179955. However, during the Ilaga-Blackshirt conflicts in the 1970s, their father and the members of his family were forced to vacate the said ancestral land. Since the evacuation and after their father’s death, a certain Felix Enojado (Felix) gained possession over the subject agricultural land.[4]
When relative peace was re-established in the area, petitioners wanted to return to the subject property, but Felix and his wife, Rosario Enojado (Rosario), informed them that the same was already registered in the name of their son, herein respondent, under OCT No. P-2887.[5]

Petitioners thus filed a civil action for recovery of ownership and possession against respondent, claiming that: 1) the certificate of title is null and void because respondent was still a minor in 1974 when he applied for free patent; 2) the parcel of land is an ancestral land which petitioners inherited from their father; 3) petitioners, as members of a cultural minority, did not convey the contested realty to respondent; and 4) the title issued to respondent violated paragraph 1 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 152,[6] and therefore null and void.[7]

Respondent, on the other hand, admitted that he was a minor at the time of his application for free patent and that Timbao was the original owner, possessor, and occupant of the subject property. He countered, among others, that: 1) petitioners’ action for recovery has already prescribed because the title issued to him had become indefeasible; 2) petitioners are estopped from questioning the transfer of property since their father had validly sold the same to his mother, Rosario; and 3) after such transfer, Rosario executed an Affidavit of Waiver of Rights over the said realty in his favor.[8]","Undaunted, petitioners now seek relief before the Court via a Petition for Certiorari, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA for dismissing their appeal based on a technicality. They likewise assail the validity of the free patent issued to respondent, contending that it was void because respondent was then a minor and did not reside in the contested realty.[18]
By way of Comment,[19] respondent posits that petitioners chose a wrong remedy, having filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 instead of a petition for review under Rule 45. He contends that assuming the CA had indeed erred in dismissing petitioners’ appeal and denying their motion for reconsideration, it merely committed an error of judgment which is not correctible by certiorari.[20] Petitioners also did not attach a certification from the Office of the Postmaster of Tacurong City to prove that they had deposited a copy of the Appellants’ Brief with the post office.[21]

In their Reply,[22] petitioners insist on the correctness of their remedy, and maintain that the CA should have been more considerate and, should have instead, required them to re-submit their brief which was unfortunately lost by the Post Office of Tacurong City.[23] Since the loss of the pleading was beyond their control, petitioners opine that the CA acted with grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed their appeal.[24]","In its March 14, 2008 Order,[9] the RTC dismissed the complaint, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, finding the affirmative defenses of the defendants to have been duly proved and with merit, this case is hereby ordered DISMISSED. There being no evidence presented to prove the counterclaims of the defendant, the same is also DISMISSED.

SO ORDERED.[10]

The RTC ruled that respondent had duly proven that: 1) the subject property was sold by petitioners’ parents to Rosario based on a Transfer of Rights and Sale of Improvements; and 2) that Rosario executed an Affidavit of Waiver of Rights covering the said realty in respondent’s favor.[11] It also held that the heirs’ rights and action to recover ownership and possession of the subject property had already prescribed since the Torrens title issued on the basis of the free patent had become indefeasible and incontrovertible one year after its issuance and registration.[12]

Aggrieved by the said order, petitioners appealed before the CA.

In its February 9, 2011 Resolution, the CA denied due course and dismissed petitioners’ appeal for failure to file an Appellant’s Brief. The CA disposed:
In view of the Judicial Records Division (JRD) verification report dated February 1, 2011 that no Appellant’s Brief has yet been filed by plaintiffs-appellants, the instant appeal is DENIED DUE COURSE and is hereby DISMISSED pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Revised Rules of Court.

SO ORDERED.[13]

On Motion for Reconsideration,[14] petitioners claimed to have filed their Appellant’s Brief through registered mail. They averred that their counsel had filed the said pleading through registered mail as shown by Registry Receipt No. 1000.[15] To prove their filing, petitioners submitted a photocopy of an Affidavit of Service for the said pleading where pasted at the bottom was the said registry receipt.[16] In its December 6, 2011 Resolution, the CA denied petitioners’ motion after finding that they do not have said pleading on file. It also faulted petitioners for failing to ensure that the CA had received their pleading, and to submit, albeit belatedly or at least simultaneously with their motion for reconsideration, a copy of their Appellants’ Brief.[17]

The petition is partly meritorious.
 
The CA may dismiss an appeal for failure to serve and file an appellant’s brief; Petitioners failed to prove filing of the Appellants’ Brief to the CA.
 
It must be stated at the outset that the right to appeal is neither a natural right nor a part of due process. It is merely a statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of law.[25] One who seeks to avail of the right to appeal must comply strictly with the requirements of the rules, otherwise, it often leads to the loss of such right.[26]

Except when a record of appeal is required, Sec. 3,[27] Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (1997 Rules) provides that an ordinary appeal from the RTC shall be taken within 15 days from notice of judgment or final order appealed from. Upon the perfection of appeal, it is the duty of the clerk of court to verify the correctness and completeness of the records that will be transmitted to the appellate court.[28] The appellant is thereafter duty-bound to file seven copies of the appellant’s brief with the court, within 45 days from receipt of the notice of the clerk that all the evidence, oral and documentary, are attached to the record, with proof of service of two copies thereof upon the appellee.[29]

On the other hand, Sec. 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules authorizes the CA to dismiss the appeal, motu proprio or upon motion of the appellee, for failure of the appellant to serve and file the appellant’s brief within the reglementary period. Pertinently, filing and service of pleadings refer to two different acts. Sec. 2, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules defines filing as the act of presenting the pleading or other paper to the clerk of court. On the other hand, service is the act of providing a party with a copy of the pleading or paper concerned. Although they pertain to different acts, filing and service go hand-in-hand and must be considered together when determining whether the pleading, motion, or any other paper was filed within the applicable reglementary period.[30]

Corollary, Sec. 12, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules states that the filing of the pleading shall be proved in the following manner:

Section 12. Proof of filing. — The filing of a pleading or paper shall be proved by its existence in the record of the case. If it is not in the record, but is claimed to have been filed personally, the filing shall be proved by the written or stamped acknowledgment of its filing by the clerk of court on a copy of the same; if filed by registered mail, by the registry receipt and by the affidavit of the person who did the mailing, containing a full statement of the date and place of depositing the mail in the post office in a sealed envelope addressed to the court, with postage fully prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after ten (10) days if not delivered. (Emphases supplied)

Principally, a pleading is deemed filed if the same exists in the records of the case. Otherwise, it may be proved depending on the manner by which it was filed. If filing was done personally, it may be proved through the acknowledgment made by the clerk of court on the party’s receiving copy. However, in the case of filing by registered mail, two documents should be presented to prove the same: (1) the registry receipt and (2) the affidavit of the person who mailed the pleading. Sec. 12 also specifically enumerates the required contents of the said affidavit: a full statement of the date and place of depositing the mail in the post office in a sealed envelope addressed to the court, with postage fully prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after 10 days if not delivered.

The Court agrees with the CA that there was no such pleading in their records. Nonetheless, petitioners have been consistent in claiming that they filed their Appellants’ Brief by registered mail. Pursuant to Sec. 12, they are burdened to prove such filing by presenting a copy of the registry receipt and the affidavit of the person who mailed the said pleading. Unfortunately, they failed to discharge their burden.

While petitioners were able to submit a copy of Registry Receipt No. 1000 which was purportedly issued by the post office when they deposited a copy of their Appellants’ Brief intended for the CA, they however have failed to submit an affidavit pursuant to Sec. 12. A simple perusal of the affidavit they attached to their motion would reveal that it pertained to the service of the pleading to respondent, and not its filing with the CA. Patently, this is not the affidavit contemplated by Sec. 12.

Moreover, the distinction between the act of filing and service would move this Court to rule that the submission of the said affidavit does not amount to substantial compliance with Sec. 12. To reiterate, petitioners are bound to prove that they filed their appellants’ brief by depositing the same in a sealed envelope addressed to the CA, instead of their service of the pleading to respondent. However, petitioners’ affidavit only proved their service of the subject pleading to respondent, and not the filing of the same to the CA. In this regard, the CA had sufficient basis to dismiss petitioners’ appeal and subsequently deny their motion for reconsideration.
 

Certiorari shall lie against the CA for instantly dismissing petitioners’ appeal.
 
Regardless of petitioners’ failure to meet the conditions under Sec. 12 of Rule 13, the Court agrees with them that the CA gravely abused its discretion in dismissing their appeal.

To recall, petitioners seek recourse to this Court pursuant to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, Sec. 1 of which states:

Section 1. Petition for certiorari. — When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annul ling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.

Evidently, the party filing a petition for certiorari must not merely allege, but be able to prove that the concerned court or tribunal acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. In National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation v. Tarobal,[31] the Court ruled that:

The doctrine is that certiorari will issue only to correct errors of jurisdiction and that no error or mistake committed by a court will be corrected by certiorari unless said court acted without jurisdiction or in excess thereof or with such grave abuse of discretion as would amount to lack of jurisdiction. The writ is available only for these purposes and not to correct errors of procedure or mistake in the findings or conclusions of the judge. It is strictly confined to the determination of the propriety of the trial court’s jurisdiction whether it has jurisdiction over the case and if so, whether the exercise of its jurisdiction has or has not been attended by grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[32]

Alquiza v. Alquiza[33] explained that the appellate court exercises not only judgment, but most importantly, discretion when it decides to dismiss an appeal based on failure of the appellant to file a brief or to explain such failure.[34] In employing such discretion, the appellate court shall consider the circumstances obtaining in the case, particularly, the demands of substantial justice. If an appeal has been dismissed, the appellate court also has sufficient discretion to reinstate the same, provided, there is good and sufficient cause obtaining in the case:

Granting that the power or discretion to reinstate an appeal that had been dismissed is included in or implied from the power or discretion to dismiss an appeal, still such power or discretion must be exercised upon a showing of good and sufficient cause, in like manner as the power or discretion vested in the appellate court to allow extensions of time for the filing of briefs. There must be such a showing which would call for, prompt and justify its exercise. Otherwise, it cannot and must not be upheld.[35]

Petitioners have constantly insisted having filed their brief through registered mail, which they now claim to have been lost.[36] They likewise point to the Affidavit of Proof of Service and Registry Receipt No. 1000 to prove that they indeed submitted the subject pleading.

To resolve this matter, the Court has no recourse but to go over the records and lay down the timeline related to the filing, or non-filing, of the subject brief.

On July 23, 2010, the CA, thru its Judicial Records Division, required the parties to submit their respective briefs within the reglementary period as provided by Secs. 7 to 9, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules.[37] On September 15, 2010, petitioners’ counsel filed a Motion for Extension[38] of 30 days from the initial deadline of September 16, 2010, or until October 16, 2010, within which to file the appellants’ brief.

It appears that on December 29, 2010,[39] the CA received respondent’s Appellee’s Brief dated December 17, 2010. In paragraph 1 of the said Brief, respondent alleged that “[t]he statement of facts and case made by plaintiffs­-appellants in their brief is so inaccurate and unsupported by the records of the case x x x.”[40]

On February 1, 2011, the Judicial Records Division submitted a Verification Report[41] stating that “No appellant’s brief filed per docket book entry as of 2/1/11.” For this reason, the CA was constrained to dismiss the appeal on February 9, 2011 pursuant to Sec. 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules. Petitioners’ counsel received a copy of the said resolution on February 22, 2011.[42] Two days thereafter, or on February 24, 2011, petitioners filed their “Motion for Reconsideration of Resolution, dated February 9, 2011”[43] and averred that they had duly filed their appellants’ brief via registered mail on October 13, 2010 to which the post office issued Registry Receipt No. 1000. Petitioners submitted, as proof, a photocopy of the purported Affidavit of Proof of Service which appears to have been attached to their appellants’ brief. A close examination of the affidavit would reveal that at the bottom portion thereof appears to be a photocopy of Registry Receipt No. 1000.[44]

Instead of resolving the motion for reconsideration, the CA issued a Resolution[45] dated June 13, 2011, which directed respondent to file his comment or opposition to said motion. Respondent complied by filing a Comment[46] which contained the following averments:

On October 21, 2020, defendant-appellee received a copy of plaintiffs-appellants’ Brief which was sent by registered mail on October 13, 2010.
On December 17, 2010, defendant-appellee filed his brief by registered mail.
However, defendant-appellee is not certain whether plaintiffs-appellants had filed their Brief in the Court of Appeals.
 
3.1
If the record in the above-entitled case shows that indeed plaintiffs-appellants had filed their Brief, then the motion for reconsideration should be granted and this case be decided on the merits.
3.2
However, if the record in the above-entitled case does not show that indeed plaintiffs-appellants had filed their Brief, then plaintiffs-appellants must be required to submit to this Court the Registry Return Card of Registry Receipt No. 1000 in order to determine whether plaintiffs-appellants’ Brief was really filed in this Court or not.[47]
The CA noted respondent’s Comment,[48] and two months thereafter, issued the now assailed Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration, holding as follows:

In this case, there is no Appellant’s Brief actually on file. Plaintiffs-appellants failed to exert effort to see to it that their brief was received by the Court of Appeals. Besides, plaintiffs-appellants did not even file their brief, albeit belatedly, but at least simultaneously with their motion for reconsideration.[49]

Based on the above chronology of the events, it is not difficult to discern why the CA resolved to dismiss petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.

Firstly, the CA merely followed the letter of Sec. 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules which grants it the authority to dismiss an appeal for failure to file and serve the appellant’s brief.[50]

Secondly, as previously discussed, petitioners failed to sufficiently demonstrate that they filed the requisite pleading by complying with Sec. 12 of Rule 13.

Lastly, the CA pointed out that despite the months that had passed before it issued the challenged Resolution, petitioners did not bother to file or re-submit, even belatedly, a copy of their Appellants’ Brief.

The CA aptly emphasized that petitioners should have exercised diligence and exerted efforts in ascertaining that it has properly received the document they filed by registered mail. Due diligence in filing the required pleading does not end with the mere deposit of the same to the post office for mailing, most especially in this case, where petitioners have been apprised of the fact of non receipt by the CA. This Court is even perplexed as to why petitioners’ counsel chose to be stubborn and insist that they had filed the brief instead of simply furnishing the CA with another copy thereof. Such would have changed the course of this case, as the CA could have judiciously exercised its discretion by admitting petitioners’ brief, and eventually decide the same based on the merits.

Notwithstanding the authority granted by Sec. 1(e) of Rule 50, as well as the circumstances which convinced the CA to dismiss petitioners’ appeal, the Court holds that it committed grave abuse of discretion in doing so.

The dismissal of an appeal based on failure to file an appellant’s brief should be guided by the principles laid down in The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium v. Court of Appeals[51] (The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium), to wit:

(1)
The general rule is for the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal when no appellant’s brief is filed within the reglementary period prescribed by the rules;
(2)
The power conferred upon the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal is discretionary and directory and not ministerial or mandatory;
(3)
The failure of an appellant to file his brief within the reglementary period does not have the effect of causing the automatic dismissal of the appeal;
(4)
In case of late filing, the appellate court has the power to still allow the appeal; however, for the proper exercise of the court’s leniency it is imperative that:
(a)
the circumstances obtaining warrant the court’s liberality;
(b)
that strong considerations of equity justify an exception to the procedural rule in the interest of substantial justice;
(c)
no material injury has been suffered by the appellee by the delay;
(d)
there is no contention that the appellees’ cause was prejudiced;
(e)
at least there is no motion to dismiss filed.
(5)
In case of delay, the lapse must be for a reasonable period; and
(6)
Inadvertence of counsel cannot be considered as an adequate excuse as to call for the appellate court’s indulgence except:
(a)
where the reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law;
(b)
when application of the rule will result in outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property; or
(c)
where the interests of justice so require.[52] (Emphases supplied)
Clearly, the CA exercises discretionary power to dismiss an appeal when an appellant’s brief has not been timely filed. Based on the same discretion, the CA may allow the belated filing of the appellant’s brief, as long as: (1) it is duly warranted by the circumstances; (2) there appears to be strong considerations of equity in the interest of substantial justice; (3) the appellee will not suffer any material injury caused by the delay; (4) there is no contention that the appellees’ cause was prejudiced; or (5) the respondent did not file any motion to dismiss.

The circumstances obtaining before the CA provide sufficient basis to allow a belated submission of the appellants’ brief.

Foremost, the CA failed to notice that respondent admitted in his Comment that he received a copy of the appellants’ brief on October 21, 2010. Said pleading was sent by registered mail on October 13, 2010.[53] It is worth noting that the date of the registered mail coincides with the date appearing on Registry Receipt No. 1000 which petitioners claim to have been issued by the post office for the appellants’ brief intended for the CA. Also, the date of the mailing was done before October 16, 2010, the last day of the extension prayed for by petitioners.

More importantly, the CA failed to consider the fact that respondent was able to file an Appellee’s Brief which, under Sec. 8, Rule 44 of the 1997 Rules, shall be filed within 45 days from receipt of the appellant’s brief. Respondent’s filing of the appellee’s brief sufficiently indicates that petitioners have properly served upon him a copy of the appellants’ brief. Else stated, respondent could not have drafted and filed his brief if he was not furnished a copy of the appellants’ brief.

With the service of the appellants’ brief to respondent, it would be absurd to presume that petitioners did not file the same. To reiterate, filing and service go hand-in-hand and must be considered together in determining whether the pleading was filed.[54]

Furthermore, respondent did not appear to have been prejudiced or suffered material injury by virtue of the non-filing of the appellants’ brief. The Court even finds as commendable, respondent’s candor and sense of fairness, when he admitted receiving appellants’ brief and even provided the date when it was sent through registered mail. He even exhorted the CA to require petitioners to submit the registry return card to determine whether they have indeed made the requisite filing.[55]

Indeed, the Court has ruled that the failure to file an appellant’s brief, although not jurisdictional, results in the abandonment of the appeal which may be the cause for its dismissal.[56] However, The Government of the Kingdom of Belgium recognizes that failure to timely file the appellant’s brief is not a cause for automatic dismissal of the appeal, and that the CA has discretionary authority to allow its belated filing when warranted.

It is well-established that rules of procedure, especially those prescribing the time within which certain acts must be done, are absolutely indispensable to the prevention of needless delays and to the orderly and speedy discharge of business. Procedural rules are tools meant to facilitate the adjudication of cases. They may be relaxed, but such relaxation in the interest of justice was never intended to be a license for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity.[57] The Court will not hesitate to be liberal in its interpretation and application of the rules, but only under the most exceptional circumstances.

Indubitably, the instant case is not one that should receive a strict application of the rules. Although petitioners may be faulted for their shortcomings, the preceding circumstances may be considered in determining whether they were remiss in filing the required pleading. These should have prompted the CA to observe more prudence in treating petitioners’ appeal, by simply requiring the latter to submit their appellants’ brief. For such lack of prudence, the CA had, lamentably, gravely abused its discretion.

The finding of grave abuse of discretion by the CA would have resulted in remanding this case to provide the latter an opportunity to resolve it based on the merits. However, to save time and in the interest of justice, the Court finds it proper to resolve the instant case.
 

Sec. 44 of Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 141[58] does not require the applicant to be of legal age and an actual resident of the land subject of the free patent application.
 
Petitioners argue in the main that a free patent cannot be validly issued on the contested land in favor of a minor who did not reside thereon.

The Court is not persuaded. While respondent may have been a minor at the time the free patent was issued to him, there appears to be no legal impediment in the issuance of such title.

The requirements for filing an application for free patent are laid down by Sec. 44 of CA No. 141 which originally provides that:

Section 44. Any natural-born citizen of the Philippines who since July fourth, nineteen hundred and twenty-six or prior thereto, has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, a tract or tracts of agricultural public lands subject to disposition, or who shall have paid the real estate tax thereon while the same has not been occupied by any person shall be entitled, under the provisions of this chapter, to have a free patent issued to him for such tract or tracts of such land not to exceed twenty-four hectares.

Clear from Sec. 44 that there were only two requirements that must be satisfied in filing an application for a free patent: (1) that the applicant is natural-born citizen of the Philippines; and (2) that since July 4, 1926, the applicant or his/her predecessors-in-interest have continuously occupied and cultivated the public agricultural land, or have paid real estate tax thereon.

At the time that respondent was granted a free patent, Sec. 44 was amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3872.[59] However, R.A. No. 3872 only introduced an additional paragraph to Sec. 44 which read as follows:

Section 44. x x x

A member of the national cultural minorities who has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in-­interest, a tract or tracts of land, whether disposable or not since July 4, 1955, shall be entitled to the right granted in the preceding paragraph of this section: Provided, That at the time he files his free patent application he is not the owner of any real estate secured or disposable under this provision of the Public Land Law.

Several decades thereafter, the first paragraph of Sec. 44 was further amended by R.A. No. 6940.[60] Still, Sec. 44 does not provide for an age limit to applicants of free patent as the amendment introduced by R.A. No. 6940 reads as follows:

Sec. 44. Any natural-born citizen of the Philippines who is not the owner of more than twelve (12) hectares and who, for at least thirty (30) years prior to the effectivity of this amendatory Act, has continuously occupied and cultivated, either by himself or through his predecessors-in­-interest a tract or tracts of agricultural public lands subject to disposition, who shall have paid the real estate tax thereon while the same has not been occupied by any person shall be entitled, under the provisions of this Chapter, to have a free patent issued to him for such tract or tracts of such land not to exceed twelve (12) hectares.

Verily, applications for free patent, whether it be under the original text of Sec. 44 or its amendments, do not provide for age limitations unlike in the other provisions in CA No. 141.[61] Hence, petitioners’ challenge against the free patent issued to respondent while he was a minor lacks legal support.

As regards the contention that respondent was not residing on the subject property which invalidates the free patent issued to him, again, petitioners are mistaken.

Aside from citizenship, Sec. 44 only requires continuous occupation and cultivation of the land either by the applicant or through the predecessors-in-interest. “Occupation” is not the same as “residence.” Occupation is not even synonymous with “possession,” the latter being broader in scope while the former delimits the all-encompassing effect of constructive possession.[62] Residence, in civil actions, refers to a place of abode, whether permanent or temporary, and differs from domicile which denotes a fixed permanent residence to which when there is absence, one has the intention of returning.[63]

Accordingly, the term “occupation and cultivation” as used in Sec. 44 does not refer to residence. Occupation and cultivation of the realty for the prescribed period grants an individual with a right to apply for a free patent under CA No. 141.[64]

It is basic rule in statutory construction that where the law does not distinguish, neither should the Court.[65] Sec. 44 of CA No. 141 did not lay down any qualification as to the age and residence of the free patent applicant. Hence, petitioners’ insistence to annul respondent’s title is devoid of any legal basis.
 

Respondent’s free patent has become indefeasible; The action for reconveyance has already prescribed.
 
It is settled that once a patent is registered and the corresponding certificate of title is issued, the land covered by it ceases to be part of the public domain and becomes private property, and the Torrens Title issued pursuant to the patent becomes indefeasible upon the expiration of one year from the date of issuance of such patent.[66] Thereafter, the remaining remedy is to file an action for reconveyance. However, an action for reconveyance and cancellation of title prescribes in 10 years from the time of the issuance of the Torrens title over the property.[67]

In the case at bench, respondent’s title, Free Patent No. 557040, was issued on January 25, 1974, and registered with the Office of the Register of Deeds in General Santos City on April 18, 1974.[68] Evidently, the free patent issued to respondent had already become indefeasible after the expiration of one year from the date its issuance.

Thus, when petitioners filed their complaint on August 28, 2006,[69] or 32 years after the issuance of the free patent, the latter was already incontrovertible. Consequently, petitioners’ action for recovery of ownership has been barred by prescription.
 

Petitioners failed to prove that the subject property was reserved and declared as an ancestral land.
 
Finally, petitioners insist that the subject property is a private ancestral land and therefore not part of public land which can be disposed by virtue of a free patent. For this reason, respondent’s free patent is null and void.[70]

Again, the argument lacks merit.

It is worth noting that petitioners had consistently relied and anchored their claims on CA No. 141, as well as P.D. No. 152, which amended certain provisions of CA No. 141, despite the effectivity of R.A. No. 8371[71] or “The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997” (IPRA) at the time they filed their complaint.[72] The IPRA specifically governs the rights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands and domains.[73] The IPRA defines ancestral lands, as follows:

SEC. 3. Definition of Terms. – x x x

x x x x

b) Ancestral Lands – Subject to Section 56 hereof, [refer to lands] occupied, possessed and utilized by individuals, families and clans who are members of the ICCs/IPs since time immemorial, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, under claims of individual or traditional group ownership, continuously, to the present except when interrupted by war, force majeure or displacement by force, deceit, stealth, or as a consequence of government projects and other voluntary dealings entered into by government and private individuals/corporations including, but not limited to, residential lots, rice terraces or paddies, private forests, swidden farms and tree lots; x x x.

At any rate, any person seeking relief under CA No. 141 admits that the property being applied for is public land.[74] CA No. 141 or the Public Land Act allows the disposition of public lands through confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles, which may be done either judicially or through the issuance of a free patent.[75] The second paragraph of Sec. 44 of CA No. 141, as amended by R.A. No. 3872, even expressly provides that indigenous peoples may apply for free patent over such realty which they have continuously cultivated and occupied since July 4, 1955.

Relatedly, Chapter III, Sec. 12[76] of the IPRA and its Implementing Rules and Regulations[77] even expressly provide for an option to secure a certificate of title under CA No. 141, as amended, over individually-owned ancestral lands which are classified as alienable and disposable agricultural lands. Thus, petitioners’ insistence that the subject realty is not part of disposable public land, but a private ancestral land, does not hold water.

Additionally, under Sec. 84 of CA No. 141, lands possessed by indigenous peoples[78] will have to be declared by the President through a proclamation, as reserved for their exclusive use. The same may also be granted to them individually, by virtue of a title or gratuitous patent, and which cannot be more than four hectares. Similarly, the rights of indigenous peoples over their ancestral lands may be formally recognized under the IPRA, through the issuance of certificates of ancestral land titles (CALT).[79] Proofs of claims to ancestral lands include the testimony under oath of elders of the community and other documents directly or indirectly attesting to the possession or occupation of the areas since time immemorial by the individual or corporate claimants in the concept of owners which shall be any of the authentic documents enumerated under Sec. 52(d) of the IPRA Law, including tax declarations and proofs of payment of taxes,[80] such as:

1)
Written accounts of the ICCs/IPs customs and traditions;
2)
Written accounts of the ICCs/IPs political structure and institution;
3)
Pictures showing long term occupation such as those of old improvements, burial grounds, sacred places and old villages;
4)
Historical accounts, including pacts and agreements concerning boundaries entered into by the ICCs/IPs concerned with other ICCs/IPs;
5)
Survey plans and sketch maps;
6)
Anthropological data;
7)
Genealogical surveys;
8)
Pictures and descriptive histories of traditional communal forests and hunting grounds;
9)
Pictures and descriptive histories of traditional landmarks such as mountains, rivers, creeks, ridges, hills, terraces and the like; and
10)
Write-ups of names and places derived from the native dialect of the community.[81]
In Lamsis v. Dong-e,[82] the Court ruled that the application for the issuance of a CALT is akin to a registration proceeding. Thus, titling does not vest ownership upon the applicant but only recognizes ownership that has already vested in the applicant by virtue of his and his predecessor-in-­interest’s possession of the property since time immemorial.[83] Although it is settled that certificates of title are not conclusive evidence of ownership, it is however the best proof of ownership of a piece of land.

In here, there was no indication of any kind that the subject parcel of land had been previously reserved and proclaimed as ancestral land. Neither was it shown that at the very least, an application for ancestral land claim was filed over the same. Apart from their bare allegations, petitioners did not offer any other proof to support their claim that the subject property was indeed an ancestral land.

In sum, petitioners failed to present proof that they possess the requisite right to reconveyance and possession of the subject realty. Hence, while the CA was found to have gravely abused its discretion when it instantly dismissed their appeal for failure to file their Appellants’ Brief, the Court still affirms the dismissal of their appeal for being unmeritorious.
 

Petitioners are not entitled to a TRO and/or WPI.
 
Provisional or ancillary remedies serve to protect actual existing rights and maintain the status quo of things. A TRO and a WPI both constitute temporary measures availed of during the pendency of the action. They are, by nature, ancillary because they are mere incidents in and are dependent upon the result of the main action.[84] They are preservative remedies for the protection of substantive rights or interests, and, hence, not a cause of action in itself, but merely adjunct to a main suit.[85]

The grant or denial of a TRO or an injunctive writ rests on the sound discretion of the court taking cognizance of the case, since the assessment and evaluation of evidence towards that end involves findings of facts left to the said court for its conclusive determination.[86] The issuance thereof is considered an extraordinary or transcendent remedy and a strong arm of equity. As such, the power to issue a writ is done with utmost caution, prudence, and deliberation, and should be exercised reasonably and sparingly only in exceptional circumstances.[87] In every application for provisional injunctive relief, the applicant must establish the actual and existing right sought to be protected. The applicant must also establish the urgency of a writ’s issuance to prevent grave and irreparable injury. Failure to do so will warrant the court’s denial of the application,[88] as in this case.

Petitioners need not substantiate their claim with complete and conclusive evidence since only prima facie evidence or a sampling is required “to give the court an idea of the justification for the preliminary injunction pending the decision of the case on the merits.”[89] However, their bare allegations in this petition were insufficient to warrant the issuance of a TRO or WPI. In view of their unsubstantiated claims and the lack of merit of the instant petition, their prayer for such reliefs must perforce be denied.

WHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying due course to and dismissing petitioners’ appeal based on technicality.

The Resolutions dated February 9, 2011 and December 6, 2011 by the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CV No. 02203-MIN are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that petitioners’ appeal is GIVEN DUE COURSE, but the same is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

The urgent prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction is hereby DENIED.

SO ORDERED.

FELIX NATHANIEL “ANGEL” VILLANUEVA MANALO II, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



GESMUNDO, C.J.:
The Court resolves the instant Appeal by Certiorari[1] filed by petitioner Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II (petitioner) seeking to reverse and set aside the August 30, 2019 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 159024, which upheld the November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution[3] of Branch 84 and the October 30, 2018 Omnibus Order[4] of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City in the following cases:
Criminal Case No. Q-17-03230-CR for Direct Assault with Frustrated Murder;
Criminal Case No. Q-17-03231-CR for Violation of Section 28(b) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunitions); and
Criminal Case Nos. Q-17-03232-33-CR for Violation of Sec. 28(g) and (h) of R.A. No. 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunitions).
Essentially, petitioner disagrees with the November 20, 2017 RTC Joint Resolution which: (1) granted the Motion to Admit Attached Amended Information;[5] (2) admitted the Amended Information;[6] and (3) denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail,[7] and the October 30, 2018 RTC Omnibus Order which denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration.[8]



On March 2, 2017 at around 6:00 a.m., police officers conducted a search in petitioner’s house located inside the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) Compound[9] by virtue of a Search Warrant[10] issued by then Presiding Judge (now CA Associate Justice) Angelene Mary W. Quimpo-Sale wherein they found several unlicensed firearms and ammunition. As a consequence, the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Quezon City conducted an inquest and issued a Resolution[11] on March 3, 2017 which, due to the finding of probable cause, recommended the filing of an Information for violation of R.A. No. 10591[12] against petitioner and other persons who were his companions at the time of the search warrant’s implementation. In the same Resolution, petitioner and his companions were ordered to be released “subject to the approval of the Inquest Chief.”[13]


The OCP charged petitioner before the RTC with Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition under Sec. 28(b)[14] of R.A. No. 10591 in an Information,[15] the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about the 2nd day of March 2017, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, without any authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his custody and control the following small arms or Class A light weapons, to wit:

a) one (1) M-16 Colt Ar 15 rifle with serial number 4952780
b) one (1) M1 carbine with serial number 4161809
c) one (1) 12 gauge Action shotgun with serial number 116534

without first having secured the necessary license/permit issued by the proper authorities.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[16]

Here, the OCP made a “no bail recommend[ation]”[17] leading the petitioner to file a Motion for Reinvestigation[18] on March 15, 2017 wherein he prayed for the RTC to issue an Order referring his case back to the OCP for preliminary investigation and to allow him to adduce evidence in his defense. To reinforce his prayer for reinvestigation, petitioner filed a Motion to Fix Bail on September 5, 2017, praying for the RTC to disregard the prosecution’s “no bail” recommendation and to fix the bail amount for his provisional liberty.[19]

On September 14, 2017, the OCP – before the RTC could act on petitioner’s motions for reinvestigation and for the fixing of bail – issued another Resolution[20] finding no reason to disturb its previous Resolution finding probable cause to charge petitioner with violation of R.A. No. 10591.[21]

Meanwhile, on October 6, 2017, Police Chief Inspector Jun G. Fortunato, one of the prosecution’s witnesses and the officer primarily previously authorized by the RTC to implement the subject Search Warrant,[22] filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration (of the Resolution dated 14 September 2017)[23] before the OCP to issue a Resolution: (1) finding the existence of conspiracy between petitioner and his companions; (2) charging petitioner and his companions of Violation of Sec. 28(e)[24] in relation to Sec. 28(b) of R.A. No. 10591; (3) charging petitioner and his companions with the complex crime of Direct Assault with Frustrated Murder under the Revised Penal Code; and (4) directing the trial prosecutor to cause the amendment of all Informations filed pursuant to the OCP’s March 3, 2017 Resolution.[25]

On October 9, 2017, the OCP filed with the RTC a Motion to Admit Attached Amended Information together with an Amended Information which added the phrase “IN REL. TO SEC. 28(e)” to the original “Section 28(b)” charge of R.A. No. 10591 as well as the phrase “Loaded with seven (7) live ammunitions” after the phrase “one (1) 12 gauge Action shotgun with serial number 116534.”[26]

On November 20, 2017, the RTC, Branch 84, through Presiding Judge Luisito G. Cortez (Judge Cortez) promulgated Joint Resolution (Motion to Fix Bail and Motion to Admit Amended Information) which, among others, denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail and admitted the prosecution’s Amended Information. The dispositive portion of the Joint Resolution reads:

WHEREFORE, in the light of the forgoing considerations, the Court resolves as follows:

DENIES the “Motion to Fix Bail” filed by accused Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II and Victor Era[ñ]o Manalo Hemedes, through counsel, dated September 4, 2017;
GRANTS the “Motion to Admit Attached Amended Information” filed by the public prosecutor dated October 9, 2017;
ADMITS the Amended Information filed by the public prosecutor dated October 9, 2017; and [sic]
SET the arraignment and [p]re-trial of accused JONATHAN S. LEDESMA, FELIX NATHANIEL VILLANUEVA MANALO II a.k.a. “ANGEL” and VICTOR ERA[Ñ]O “JEM” MANALO HEMEDEZ on December 6, 2017 at 10:00 o’clock in the morning to be conducted at Metro Manila District Jail Courtroom at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City[;]
ORDERS the Jail [W]arden, Jose Gemeb C. Taol of MMDJ, Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City to prepare the court room for trial on said date and time[; and]
ORDERS the Branch Clerk of Court of this court to notify all parties, their counsels and witnesses of the venue of trial of these cases.
SO ORDERED.[27]

In the said Joint Resolution, the RTC reasoned that: (1) Sec. 14,[28] Rule 110 of the Rules of Court allows the prosecution to amend or substitute a complaint or information already filed with the trial court, either in form or in substance, at any time before the accused enters his or her plea; unless the amendment will downgrade or drop the accused in the new complaint or information;[29] (2) the Amended Information shows that the same bears City Prosecutor Donald T. Lee’s (City Prosecutor Lee) signature indicating his approval of petitioner’s indictment; and that Office Order No. 44,[30] which delegated the approving authority to Deputy City Prosecutor/Chief Inquest Division Rogelio A. Velasco (Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco) is valid;[31] and (3) petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right as he is charged with a capital offense.[32]

On November 21, 2017, petitioner filed a Manifestation[33] that the prosecution had allegedly tampered and altered the original October 9, 2017 Amended Information which did not contain the signature and approval of City Prosecutor Lee and therefore, the same amended initiatory pleading is void pursuant to People v. Garfin[34] which is the prevailing doctrine. He pointed out that the new Amended Information which now bears City Prosecutor Lee’s signature and approval was only submitted to the RTC on October 9, 2017.[35]

On December 4, 2017, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Joint Resolution dated November 20, 2017) seeking to reverse the RTC’s November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution, deny the prosecution’s Amended Information, and grant his Motion to Fix Bail.

On even date, petitioner also filed a Motion to Inhibit[36] against Judge Cortez for allegedly being selective in the appreciation of evidence.[37]

On December 20, 2017, the RTC, through Judge Cortez, issued a Joint Order[38] granting petitioner’s Motion to Inhibit.

On February 23, 2018, petitioner filed another Motion to Inhibit[39] against Presiding Judge Juris S. Dilinila-Callanta (Judge Dilinila-Callanta) as she allegedly posted a copy of Pasugo (a magazine maintained and published by Iglesia ni Cristo whose Executive Minister is petitioner’s sibling) outside the court’s door.[40]

On April 12, 2018, the RTC, through Judge Dilinila-Callanta, promulgated a Resolution[41] granting petitioner’s Motion to Inhibit causing the case to again be re-raffled to Presiding Judge Alfonso C. Ruiz II (Judge Ruiz).[42]

On October 30, 2018, the RTC, Branch 216, through Judge Ruiz, issued an Omnibus Oder with the decretal portion which reads:

WHEREFORE, the court rules as follows:

deny the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Joint Resolution dated November 20, 2017) dated December 4, 2017 filed by accused Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II;
grant the Motion to Disqualify Private Prosecutor dated July 27, 2018 filed by accused Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II and Victor Era[ñ]o Manalo Hemedez. The law firm of Angara Abella Concepcion Regala & Cruz and/or any of its lawyers is disqualified to act as private prosecutors in the present case, and is prohibited from further prosecuting the present criminal cases; and
deny the Motion to Disqualify Private Prosecutor dated September 11, 2018 filed by accused Jonathan Ledesma, Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II, and Victor Era[ñ]o “Jem” Manalo Hemedez.
Set this case for arraignment on November 23, 2018 at 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon at Quezon City Jail Annex Courtroom at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City.

SO ORDERED.[43]

Here, the RTC ratiocinated among others that: (1) the belated submission of the Amended Information bearing the City Prosecutor’s signature does not invalidate the same pleading reiterating that “the prosecution was well within their [sic] right to amend the information before a plea is entered;”[44] (2) petitioner was no longer entitled to bail as a matter of right in view of the admission of the valid Amended Information charging him of a capital offense;[45] (3) this Court, in People v. Bon,[46] had held that the amendatory effect of R.A. No. 9346[47] only extends “to the application of death penalty but not to the definition or classification of crimes.”[48]



On January 7, 2019, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari[49] before the CA seeking to: (1) set aside the RTC’s November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution, which denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail and admitted the prosecution’s Amended Information; and (2) modify the October 30, 2018 Omnibus Order, insofar as it granted the prosecution’s October 9, 2017 Motion to Admit Amended Information.[50]
On August 30, 2019, the CA rendered a Decision, the fallo of which reads:

WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition is DISMISSED. The assailed Joint Resolution dated November 20, 2017 and the Omnibus Order dated October 30, 2018, issued by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 84, and Branch 216, respectively, in Criminal Case No. Q-17-03230-CR for Direct Assault with Murder; Criminal Case No. Q-17-03231-CR for Violation of Sec. 28 (b) of RA 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition); and Criminal Case No. Q-17-03232-33-CR for Violation of Sec. 28 (g) and (h) of RA 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition) are hereby AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[51]

In its Decision, the CA explained that: (1) the Amended Information’s defect – lack of City Prosecutor Lee’s signature and approval – was cured when the prosecution submitted a cured version before petitioner’s arraignment as it is allowed by the Rules of Court;[52] and (2) petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right because the prescribed penalty under the offense for which he was charged – Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 – is reclusion perpetua to death.[53]



Petitioner essentially argues that: (1) he is entitled to bail as a matter of right because the prescribed penalty under the original Information charging him with Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition under Sec. 28(b) of R.A. No. 10591 is reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua – a divisible penalty below the threshold of what constitutes a capital offense;[54] (2) he is entitled to bail as a matter of right since even under the Amended Information, the imposable penalty cannot be qualified anymore in view of R.A. No. 9346 which suspended the penalty of death;[55] (3) the Amended Information – which charged him for violation of Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 with the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death – is defective for lack of prior written authority or approval of City Prosecutor Lee;[56] (4) Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco had no authority to approve, disapprove or modify the original Information because City Prosecutor Lee merely delegated such power to him only insofar as the conduct of inquests is concerned;[57] (5) the prosecution allegedly removed and tampered with the Amended Information surreptitiously as its original version only contained Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco’s signature, which was eventually replaced with another version containing City Prosecutor Lee’s signature;[58] and (6) the lack of a prior written authority in the Amended Information cannot be cured by the belated signing of City Prosecutor Lee as such requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional in nature.[59]
The prosecution, through the Office of the Solicitor General, counter­-argues that: (1) the prosecution is allowed to make substantial amendments to an Information already filed with the courts as a matter of right pursuant to Sec. 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court;[60] (2) the first version of the Amended Information signed and approved by Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco – before its second version containing City Prosecutor Lee’s signature – is valid in view of Office Order No. 44;[61] (3) City Prosecutor Lee signed and approved the second version of the Amended Information prior to petitioner’s arraignment;[62] (4) the RTC correctly denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail as he was validly charged with violation of Sec. 28(b) in relation to Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 – a non-bailable offense for having the prescribed penalty of reclusion perpetua to death;[63] (5) the original Information charging petitioner with a non-bailable offense is no longer applicable as it had been superseded by the Amended Information;[64] (6) modifying circumstances are not considered in mala prohibita crimes “because the law intends to discourage the commission of the act specially prohibited;”[65] (7) R.A. No. 9346 does not prevent the penalty from being raised a degree higher;[66] (8) the ruling in People v. Valdez[67] – wherein aggravating circumstances should not be considered for purposes of bail – does not apply because the presence of live ammunition in an unlicensed firearm is a qualifying circumstance;[68] and (9) the rule of lenity does not apply since the provisions of R.A. No. 10591 regarding the prescribed penalties are free from ambiguity and do not need to be interpreted.[69]



I.

Whether the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the RTC’s part for upholding the validity of the Amended Information charging petitioner with a capital offense.
II.

Whether the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the RTC’s part for holding that petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right.


Preliminary Considerations:
Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the appellate court and this Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court a quo.[70] Although jurisprudence has provided several exceptions to this rule, exceptions must be alleged, substantiated, and proved by the parties so this court may evaluate and review the facts of the case.[71]

Verily, it is essential to characterize the questions raised in a petition under Rule 45 in order to determine whether an appeal through this mode deserves the attention of this Court. A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.[72]

In this case, petitioner did not dispute the RTC’s factual findings in the latter’s November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution and October 30, 2018 Omnibus Order. What he assails are: (1) the validity of the Amended Information for being previously filed without City Prosecutor Lee’s approving signature; and (2) his supposedly wrongful denial to post bail as a matter of right – both issues which involve only the application of law and pertinent jurisprudence. With the aforementioned adjudicative parameters in place, the Court now proceeds to determine whether the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC for: (1) admitting and upholding the validity of the Amended Information; and (2) declaring that petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right.

Substantive Considerations:

Before the Court can determine whether petitioner is entitled to bail as a matter of right, there is a need to determine whether the Amended Information could be valid basis for indictment. In this regard, the Court evinces its observation that both the original Information[73] and the original copy of the Amended Information[74] do not contain City Prosecutor Lee’s approval and signature. It was only when Prosecutor Nilo A. Peñaflor filed his Reply (to the Accused’s Opposition Re: Motion to Admit Amended Information Dated 19 October 2017)[75] that a second copy of the Amended Information[76] bearing City Prosecutor Lee’s conformity in the form of a signed approval was submitted to the RTC. To determine the Amended Information’s validity, there is a need to re-examine Sec. 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court which reads:

Section 14. Amendment or substitution. — A complaint or information may be amended, in form or in substance, without leave of court, at any time before the accused enters his plea. After the plea and during the trial, a formal amendment may only be made with leave of court and when it can be done without causing prejudice to the rights of the accused.

However, any amendment before plea, which downgrades the nature of the offense charged in or excludes any accused from the complaint or information, can be made only upon motion by the prosecutor, with notice to the offended party and with leave of court. The court shall state its reasons in resolving the motion and copies of its order shall be furnished all parties, especially the offended party.

If it appears at any time before judgment that a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense, the court shall dismiss the original complaint or information upon the filing of a new one charging the proper offense in accordance with [S]ection 19, Rule 119, provided the accused shall not be placed in double jeopardy. The court may require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the trial. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Since the arraignment had not yet been conducted by the RTC as shown in the records, petitioner’s insistence of invalidity as regards the second copy of the Amended Information containing City Prosecutor Lee’s approval and signature is an exercise in futility. Both formal and substantial amendments to a Complaint or Information may be done by the prosecution “at any time before the accused enters his plea” even “without leave of court.” Before arraignment, no substantive right of petitioner had been violated as he is yet to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. It is only when he has been informed of such nature and cause of accusation during arraignment that substantial amendments to the Complaint or Information cannot be done. Thus, the prosecution is given the right to amend the Information, regardless of its nature, so long as the amendment is sought before the accused enters his plea.[77]

More importantly, the Court en banc had already ruled in People v. Villa Gomez[78] (Villa Gomez), that the lack of signature and approval on the part of the chief state, provincial or city prosecutor only amounts to a formal – not substantial – defect, as it does not affect the trial court’s jurisdiction of either the nature of the case or the person of the accused. Understandably, petitioner had relied on previous pronouncements of this Court to support his arguments that the Amended Information was invalid as those were the doctrines controlling at that time. And although judicial decisions (such as Villa Gomez) may only be applied prospectively,[79] petitioner cannot rely on this Court’s previous rulings treating the lack of a city prosecutor’s approval and signature on the face of the Information as a substantial jurisdictional defect. Jurisprudence, in our system of government, cannot be considered as an independent source of law — it cannot create law.[80] Consequently, petitioner cannot rely on past rulings as it is not a matter of substantive law which creates substantive rights.

As to the issue of bail, petitioner is not entitled to the same remedy as a matter of right. The ruling in Valdez[81] – where bail was granted as a matter of right for a complex crime charge because the “prescribed” penalty ranges from reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua – does not apply to petitioner’s case. Valdez applied the in dubio pro reo principle because reclusion temporal – the lowest imposable penalty in the range of the prescribed penalty – is a bailable offense. Since the Information charging him with violation of Sec. 28(b) in relation to Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 – a “non-bailable”[82] offense having the prescribed penalty of reclusion perpetua to death – is not invalid, petitioner may only be entitled to bail if he satisfactorily presents evidence that the evidence of guilt against him is not strong.

As a result, the determination in this case as to whether the evidence of guilt is strong is a matter of judicial discretion. The trial court has the prerogative to exercise judicial discretion, unless, such discretion is laced with grave abuse.[83] By grave abuse of discretion is meant, such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.[84] In other words, mere abuse of discretion is not enough – it must be grave.[85] In this case, the CA did not err in concluding that the RTC did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecution to amend the Information before petitioner had entered his plea.

WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition is DENIED. Accordingly, the August 30, 2019 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-­G.R. SP No. 159024 is AFFIRMED.

No pronouncement as to costs.

SO ORDERED.

Hernando, Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","On March 2, 2017 at around 6:00 a.m., police officers conducted a search in petitioner’s house located inside the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) Compound[9] by virtue of a Search Warrant[10] issued by then Presiding Judge (now CA Associate Justice) Angelene Mary W. Quimpo-Sale wherein they found several unlicensed firearms and ammunition. As a consequence, the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Quezon City conducted an inquest and issued a Resolution[11] on March 3, 2017 which, due to the finding of probable cause, recommended the filing of an Information for violation of R.A. No. 10591[12] against petitioner and other persons who were his companions at the time of the search warrant’s implementation. In the same Resolution, petitioner and his companions were ordered to be released “subject to the approval of the Inquest Chief.”[13]

Petitioner essentially argues that: (1) he is entitled to bail as a matter of right because the prescribed penalty under the original Information charging him with Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition under Sec. 28(b) of R.A. No. 10591 is reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua – a divisible penalty below the threshold of what constitutes a capital offense;[54] (2) he is entitled to bail as a matter of right since even under the Amended Information, the imposable penalty cannot be qualified anymore in view of R.A. No. 9346 which suspended the penalty of death;[55] (3) the Amended Information – which charged him for violation of Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 with the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death – is defective for lack of prior written authority or approval of City Prosecutor Lee;[56] (4) Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco had no authority to approve, disapprove or modify the original Information because City Prosecutor Lee merely delegated such power to him only insofar as the conduct of inquests is concerned;[57] (5) the prosecution allegedly removed and tampered with the Amended Information surreptitiously as its original version only contained Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco’s signature, which was eventually replaced with another version containing City Prosecutor Lee’s signature;[58] and (6) the lack of a prior written authority in the Amended Information cannot be cured by the belated signing of City Prosecutor Lee as such requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional in nature.[59]
The prosecution, through the Office of the Solicitor General, counter­-argues that: (1) the prosecution is allowed to make substantial amendments to an Information already filed with the courts as a matter of right pursuant to Sec. 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court;[60] (2) the first version of the Amended Information signed and approved by Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco – before its second version containing City Prosecutor Lee’s signature – is valid in view of Office Order No. 44;[61] (3) City Prosecutor Lee signed and approved the second version of the Amended Information prior to petitioner’s arraignment;[62] (4) the RTC correctly denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail as he was validly charged with violation of Sec. 28(b) in relation to Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 – a non-bailable offense for having the prescribed penalty of reclusion perpetua to death;[63] (5) the original Information charging petitioner with a non-bailable offense is no longer applicable as it had been superseded by the Amended Information;[64] (6) modifying circumstances are not considered in mala prohibita crimes “because the law intends to discourage the commission of the act specially prohibited;”[65] (7) R.A. No. 9346 does not prevent the penalty from being raised a degree higher;[66] (8) the ruling in People v. Valdez[67] – wherein aggravating circumstances should not be considered for purposes of bail – does not apply because the presence of live ammunition in an unlicensed firearm is a qualifying circumstance;[68] and (9) the rule of lenity does not apply since the provisions of R.A. No. 10591 regarding the prescribed penalties are free from ambiguity and do not need to be interpreted.[69]","I.

Whether the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the RTC’s part for upholding the validity of the Amended Information charging petitioner with a capital offense.
II.

Whether the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the RTC’s part for holding that petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right.","The OCP charged petitioner before the RTC with Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition under Sec. 28(b)[14] of R.A. No. 10591 in an Information,[15] the accusatory portion of which reads:
That on or about the 2nd day of March 2017, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, without any authority of law, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his custody and control the following small arms or Class A light weapons, to wit:

a) one (1) M-16 Colt Ar 15 rifle with serial number 4952780
b) one (1) M1 carbine with serial number 4161809
c) one (1) 12 gauge Action shotgun with serial number 116534

without first having secured the necessary license/permit issued by the proper authorities.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[16]

Here, the OCP made a “no bail recommend[ation]”[17] leading the petitioner to file a Motion for Reinvestigation[18] on March 15, 2017 wherein he prayed for the RTC to issue an Order referring his case back to the OCP for preliminary investigation and to allow him to adduce evidence in his defense. To reinforce his prayer for reinvestigation, petitioner filed a Motion to Fix Bail on September 5, 2017, praying for the RTC to disregard the prosecution’s “no bail” recommendation and to fix the bail amount for his provisional liberty.[19]

On September 14, 2017, the OCP – before the RTC could act on petitioner’s motions for reinvestigation and for the fixing of bail – issued another Resolution[20] finding no reason to disturb its previous Resolution finding probable cause to charge petitioner with violation of R.A. No. 10591.[21]

Meanwhile, on October 6, 2017, Police Chief Inspector Jun G. Fortunato, one of the prosecution’s witnesses and the officer primarily previously authorized by the RTC to implement the subject Search Warrant,[22] filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration (of the Resolution dated 14 September 2017)[23] before the OCP to issue a Resolution: (1) finding the existence of conspiracy between petitioner and his companions; (2) charging petitioner and his companions of Violation of Sec. 28(e)[24] in relation to Sec. 28(b) of R.A. No. 10591; (3) charging petitioner and his companions with the complex crime of Direct Assault with Frustrated Murder under the Revised Penal Code; and (4) directing the trial prosecutor to cause the amendment of all Informations filed pursuant to the OCP’s March 3, 2017 Resolution.[25]

On October 9, 2017, the OCP filed with the RTC a Motion to Admit Attached Amended Information together with an Amended Information which added the phrase “IN REL. TO SEC. 28(e)” to the original “Section 28(b)” charge of R.A. No. 10591 as well as the phrase “Loaded with seven (7) live ammunitions” after the phrase “one (1) 12 gauge Action shotgun with serial number 116534.”[26]

On November 20, 2017, the RTC, Branch 84, through Presiding Judge Luisito G. Cortez (Judge Cortez) promulgated Joint Resolution (Motion to Fix Bail and Motion to Admit Amended Information) which, among others, denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail and admitted the prosecution’s Amended Information. The dispositive portion of the Joint Resolution reads:

WHEREFORE, in the light of the forgoing considerations, the Court resolves as follows:

DENIES the “Motion to Fix Bail” filed by accused Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II and Victor Era[ñ]o Manalo Hemedes, through counsel, dated September 4, 2017;
GRANTS the “Motion to Admit Attached Amended Information” filed by the public prosecutor dated October 9, 2017;
ADMITS the Amended Information filed by the public prosecutor dated October 9, 2017; and [sic]
SET the arraignment and [p]re-trial of accused JONATHAN S. LEDESMA, FELIX NATHANIEL VILLANUEVA MANALO II a.k.a. “ANGEL” and VICTOR ERA[Ñ]O “JEM” MANALO HEMEDEZ on December 6, 2017 at 10:00 o’clock in the morning to be conducted at Metro Manila District Jail Courtroom at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City[;]
ORDERS the Jail [W]arden, Jose Gemeb C. Taol of MMDJ, Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City to prepare the court room for trial on said date and time[; and]
ORDERS the Branch Clerk of Court of this court to notify all parties, their counsels and witnesses of the venue of trial of these cases.
SO ORDERED.[27]

In the said Joint Resolution, the RTC reasoned that: (1) Sec. 14,[28] Rule 110 of the Rules of Court allows the prosecution to amend or substitute a complaint or information already filed with the trial court, either in form or in substance, at any time before the accused enters his or her plea; unless the amendment will downgrade or drop the accused in the new complaint or information;[29] (2) the Amended Information shows that the same bears City Prosecutor Donald T. Lee’s (City Prosecutor Lee) signature indicating his approval of petitioner’s indictment; and that Office Order No. 44,[30] which delegated the approving authority to Deputy City Prosecutor/Chief Inquest Division Rogelio A. Velasco (Deputy City Prosecutor Velasco) is valid;[31] and (3) petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right as he is charged with a capital offense.[32]

On November 21, 2017, petitioner filed a Manifestation[33] that the prosecution had allegedly tampered and altered the original October 9, 2017 Amended Information which did not contain the signature and approval of City Prosecutor Lee and therefore, the same amended initiatory pleading is void pursuant to People v. Garfin[34] which is the prevailing doctrine. He pointed out that the new Amended Information which now bears City Prosecutor Lee’s signature and approval was only submitted to the RTC on October 9, 2017.[35]

On December 4, 2017, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Joint Resolution dated November 20, 2017) seeking to reverse the RTC’s November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution, deny the prosecution’s Amended Information, and grant his Motion to Fix Bail.

On even date, petitioner also filed a Motion to Inhibit[36] against Judge Cortez for allegedly being selective in the appreciation of evidence.[37]

On December 20, 2017, the RTC, through Judge Cortez, issued a Joint Order[38] granting petitioner’s Motion to Inhibit.

On February 23, 2018, petitioner filed another Motion to Inhibit[39] against Presiding Judge Juris S. Dilinila-Callanta (Judge Dilinila-Callanta) as she allegedly posted a copy of Pasugo (a magazine maintained and published by Iglesia ni Cristo whose Executive Minister is petitioner’s sibling) outside the court’s door.[40]

On April 12, 2018, the RTC, through Judge Dilinila-Callanta, promulgated a Resolution[41] granting petitioner’s Motion to Inhibit causing the case to again be re-raffled to Presiding Judge Alfonso C. Ruiz II (Judge Ruiz).[42]

On October 30, 2018, the RTC, Branch 216, through Judge Ruiz, issued an Omnibus Oder with the decretal portion which reads:

WHEREFORE, the court rules as follows:

deny the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Joint Resolution dated November 20, 2017) dated December 4, 2017 filed by accused Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II;
grant the Motion to Disqualify Private Prosecutor dated July 27, 2018 filed by accused Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II and Victor Era[ñ]o Manalo Hemedez. The law firm of Angara Abella Concepcion Regala & Cruz and/or any of its lawyers is disqualified to act as private prosecutors in the present case, and is prohibited from further prosecuting the present criminal cases; and
deny the Motion to Disqualify Private Prosecutor dated September 11, 2018 filed by accused Jonathan Ledesma, Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Villanueva Manalo II, and Victor Era[ñ]o “Jem” Manalo Hemedez.
Set this case for arraignment on November 23, 2018 at 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon at Quezon City Jail Annex Courtroom at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City.

SO ORDERED.[43]

Here, the RTC ratiocinated among others that: (1) the belated submission of the Amended Information bearing the City Prosecutor’s signature does not invalidate the same pleading reiterating that “the prosecution was well within their [sic] right to amend the information before a plea is entered;”[44] (2) petitioner was no longer entitled to bail as a matter of right in view of the admission of the valid Amended Information charging him of a capital offense;[45] (3) this Court, in People v. Bon,[46] had held that the amendatory effect of R.A. No. 9346[47] only extends “to the application of death penalty but not to the definition or classification of crimes.”[48]

On January 7, 2019, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari[49] before the CA seeking to: (1) set aside the RTC’s November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution, which denied petitioner’s Motion to Fix Bail and admitted the prosecution’s Amended Information; and (2) modify the October 30, 2018 Omnibus Order, insofar as it granted the prosecution’s October 9, 2017 Motion to Admit Amended Information.[50]
On August 30, 2019, the CA rendered a Decision, the fallo of which reads:

WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition is DISMISSED. The assailed Joint Resolution dated November 20, 2017 and the Omnibus Order dated October 30, 2018, issued by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 84, and Branch 216, respectively, in Criminal Case No. Q-17-03230-CR for Direct Assault with Murder; Criminal Case No. Q-17-03231-CR for Violation of Sec. 28 (b) of RA 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition); and Criminal Case No. Q-17-03232-33-CR for Violation of Sec. 28 (g) and (h) of RA 10591 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition) are hereby AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[51]

In its Decision, the CA explained that: (1) the Amended Information’s defect – lack of City Prosecutor Lee’s signature and approval – was cured when the prosecution submitted a cured version before petitioner’s arraignment as it is allowed by the Rules of Court;[52] and (2) petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right because the prescribed penalty under the offense for which he was charged – Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 – is reclusion perpetua to death.[53]

Preliminary Considerations:
Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the appellate court and this Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court a quo.[70] Although jurisprudence has provided several exceptions to this rule, exceptions must be alleged, substantiated, and proved by the parties so this court may evaluate and review the facts of the case.[71]

Verily, it is essential to characterize the questions raised in a petition under Rule 45 in order to determine whether an appeal through this mode deserves the attention of this Court. A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.[72]

In this case, petitioner did not dispute the RTC’s factual findings in the latter’s November 20, 2017 Joint Resolution and October 30, 2018 Omnibus Order. What he assails are: (1) the validity of the Amended Information for being previously filed without City Prosecutor Lee’s approving signature; and (2) his supposedly wrongful denial to post bail as a matter of right – both issues which involve only the application of law and pertinent jurisprudence. With the aforementioned adjudicative parameters in place, the Court now proceeds to determine whether the CA erred in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC for: (1) admitting and upholding the validity of the Amended Information; and (2) declaring that petitioner is not entitled to bail as a matter of right.

Substantive Considerations:

Before the Court can determine whether petitioner is entitled to bail as a matter of right, there is a need to determine whether the Amended Information could be valid basis for indictment. In this regard, the Court evinces its observation that both the original Information[73] and the original copy of the Amended Information[74] do not contain City Prosecutor Lee’s approval and signature. It was only when Prosecutor Nilo A. Peñaflor filed his Reply (to the Accused’s Opposition Re: Motion to Admit Amended Information Dated 19 October 2017)[75] that a second copy of the Amended Information[76] bearing City Prosecutor Lee’s conformity in the form of a signed approval was submitted to the RTC. To determine the Amended Information’s validity, there is a need to re-examine Sec. 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court which reads:

Section 14. Amendment or substitution. — A complaint or information may be amended, in form or in substance, without leave of court, at any time before the accused enters his plea. After the plea and during the trial, a formal amendment may only be made with leave of court and when it can be done without causing prejudice to the rights of the accused.

However, any amendment before plea, which downgrades the nature of the offense charged in or excludes any accused from the complaint or information, can be made only upon motion by the prosecutor, with notice to the offended party and with leave of court. The court shall state its reasons in resolving the motion and copies of its order shall be furnished all parties, especially the offended party.

If it appears at any time before judgment that a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense, the court shall dismiss the original complaint or information upon the filing of a new one charging the proper offense in accordance with [S]ection 19, Rule 119, provided the accused shall not be placed in double jeopardy. The court may require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the trial. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Since the arraignment had not yet been conducted by the RTC as shown in the records, petitioner’s insistence of invalidity as regards the second copy of the Amended Information containing City Prosecutor Lee’s approval and signature is an exercise in futility. Both formal and substantial amendments to a Complaint or Information may be done by the prosecution “at any time before the accused enters his plea” even “without leave of court.” Before arraignment, no substantive right of petitioner had been violated as he is yet to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. It is only when he has been informed of such nature and cause of accusation during arraignment that substantial amendments to the Complaint or Information cannot be done. Thus, the prosecution is given the right to amend the Information, regardless of its nature, so long as the amendment is sought before the accused enters his plea.[77]

More importantly, the Court en banc had already ruled in People v. Villa Gomez[78] (Villa Gomez), that the lack of signature and approval on the part of the chief state, provincial or city prosecutor only amounts to a formal – not substantial – defect, as it does not affect the trial court’s jurisdiction of either the nature of the case or the person of the accused. Understandably, petitioner had relied on previous pronouncements of this Court to support his arguments that the Amended Information was invalid as those were the doctrines controlling at that time. And although judicial decisions (such as Villa Gomez) may only be applied prospectively,[79] petitioner cannot rely on this Court’s previous rulings treating the lack of a city prosecutor’s approval and signature on the face of the Information as a substantial jurisdictional defect. Jurisprudence, in our system of government, cannot be considered as an independent source of law — it cannot create law.[80] Consequently, petitioner cannot rely on past rulings as it is not a matter of substantive law which creates substantive rights.

As to the issue of bail, petitioner is not entitled to the same remedy as a matter of right. The ruling in Valdez[81] – where bail was granted as a matter of right for a complex crime charge because the “prescribed” penalty ranges from reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua – does not apply to petitioner’s case. Valdez applied the in dubio pro reo principle because reclusion temporal – the lowest imposable penalty in the range of the prescribed penalty – is a bailable offense. Since the Information charging him with violation of Sec. 28(b) in relation to Sec. 28(e) of R.A. No. 10591 – a “non-bailable”[82] offense having the prescribed penalty of reclusion perpetua to death – is not invalid, petitioner may only be entitled to bail if he satisfactorily presents evidence that the evidence of guilt against him is not strong.

D E C I S I O N



INTING, J.:
Before the Court is an appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated January 15, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13666. The CA affirmed the Decision[3] dated June 5, 2019, of Branch 164, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasig City in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG that found Nhelmar Mendiola y Martin alias “Honda” (accused-appellant Nhelmar), Noel Mendiola y Ponce alias “Noel” (accused-appellant Noel), and Glen Ramos y Akiatan alias “Glen” (accused-appellant Glen) (collectively, accused-appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5,[4] Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165,[5] otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002,” as amended. The CA also affirmed accused-appellant Noel’s conviction in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG for violation of Section 11,[6] Article II of the same law.

The instant case stemmed from two separate Informations in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG which charged accused-appellants with Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs; and Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG which charged accused-appellant Noel with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs. The accusatory portions of the two Informations state:

Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG

On or about September 27, 2015, in Pasig City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, conspiring and confederating together and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another, not being lawfully authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver, and give away to PO3 Jun Mataverde, a member of [the] Philippine National Police, who acted as police poseur buyer, one (1) double self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing 1050.68[7] grams of white crystalline substance, which was found positive to the test for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, in violation of said law.

Contrary to law.[8]

Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG

On or about September 27, 2015, in Pasig City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, not being lawfully authorized to possess any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and under his custody and control one (1) double self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing 979.07 grams of white crystalline substance, which was found positive to the test of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, in violation of said law.

Contrary to law.[9]

Upon arraignment, accused-appellants entered a plea of “Not Guilty” to the respective charges.[10]

Trial ensued.



The prosecution established that on September 27, 2015, at around 5:00 a.m., a male confidential informant (CI) went to the Regional Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (RAID-SOTG) at Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, Taguig City, and reported that a certain person known as “Honda” (later identified as accused-appellant Nhelmar) and his cohorts were involved in the rampant selling of illegal drugs in Pasig City. The CI informed Police Inspector Michael Yap (P/Insp. Yap) that they set a deal at 8:00 p.m. at the parking lot of Jollibee, Ortigas Extension, Brgy. Rosario, Pasig City. Thus, Police Chief Inspector Roberto Razon (PCI Razon) instructed P/Insp. Yap to form a buy-bust team.[11]

The team was composed of the following: P/Insp. Yap; Police Officer 3 Junjun Mataverde[12] (PO3 Mataverde), the poseur-buyer; Senior Police Officer 2 Nirbert E. Porlucas (SPO2 Porlucas), the arresting officer; and PO3 Neil Dumlao[13] (PO3 Dumlao) and SPO3 Rolando Aligier, Jr.[14] (SPO3 Aligier), the back-up officers.[15] P/Insp. Yap instructed the CI to arrange a transaction with the group of “Honda” and introduce PO3 Mataverde as a buyer of one kilogram of shabu. The buy-bust team coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and prepared the marked money. Afterwards, the team proceeded to the target area.[16]

At the target area, around 8:00 p.m., a green Honda Civic sedan with plate no. LDD-814 and a black Honda Civic sedan with plate no. UUY-594 arrived. A man (later identified as accused-appellant Nhelmar) alighted from the black Honda Civic. The CI approached accused-appellant Nhelmar and immediately introduced PO3 Mataverde as the buyer of shabu. Accused-appellant Nhelmar then called his companions who were inside the green Honda Civic. He instructed one of his companions, a long-haired male person (later identified as accused-appellant Glen) to get the striped plastic bag containing one kilogram of shabu from the passenger seat of the black Honda Civic. Meanwhile, the other cohort, an older man (later identified as accused-appellant Noel) uttered: “Ako na maglu-look out para sigurado.”[17]

Accused-appellant Glen took out the striped plastic bag from the black Honda Civic and handed it to PO3 Mataverde, who then opened it and saw inside a self-sealing plastic bag containing white crystalline substance suspected to be shabu. In exchange, PO3 Mataverde gave to accused-appellant Nhelmar a brown envelope containing the marked money. While accused-appellant Nhelmar was opening the brown envelope, PO3 Mataverde executed the pre-arranged signal. In no time, SPO2 Porlucas and PO3 Dumlao immediately rushed to the scene and assisted PO3 Mataverde in arresting all of the accused-appellants.[18]

SPO2 Porlucas then subjected accused-appellant Nhelmar to a body frisk. He confiscated from the latter’s possession one .38 caliber gun with five pieces of ammunition. PO3 Mataverde, on the other hand, apprehended accused-appellant Noel inside the green car and confiscated from him one black bag with one self-sealing plastic bag containing suspected shabu.[19]

After the police officers informed accused-appellants of their constitutional rights, they conducted the marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized items at the place of arrest in the presence of several witnesses. PO3 Mataverde marked the seized items as follows: (1) the red and white striped plastic bag with the markings “JRM/NMM 9/27/15,” (referring to his initials, the initials of accused-appellant Nhelmar, and the date of seizure) and its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, with the markings “JRM/NMM-A 9/27/15;” and (2) the black bag with the markings “JRM/NMP 9/27/15,” (his initials, the initials of accused-appellant Noel, and date of seizure), and its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, with the markings “JRM/NMP-1 9/27/15.” Meanwhile, SPO2 Porlucas marked the .38 caliber gun with the markings “NP/NMM 9/27/15” and the five pieces of live ammunition with “NP/NMM-1 9/27/15” to “NP/NMM-5 9/27/15.”[20]

PO3 Mataverde then conducted the inventory in the presence of the following: accused-appellants; Jun Mestica[21] (Mestica), media representative of Remate Tonite; and Barangay Kagawad Henry Dela Cruz (Kagawad Dela Cruz).[22]

The following also witnessed the conduct of the inventory: representatives from other media outlets, such as ABS-CBN, GMA Network, and TV5; SPO3 Aligier, the assigned investigator; PCI Razon; Director General Joel Pagdilao (Gen. Pagdilao) of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO); and Secretary Mel Senen Sarmiento (Secretary Sarmiento) of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).[23]

During the inventory at the place of arrest, the team took photographs of the seized items and accused-appellants.[24]

Thereafter, the police officers brought accused-appellants and the seized items to Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, for documentation.[25] SPO3 Aligier then prepared the necessary documents for the investigation. After the investigation, PO3 Mataverde turned over the marked and sealed seized items to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory. PCI Alejandro De Guzman (PCI De Guzman) received the marked and sealed seized specimen, the Request for Laboratory Examination, and the Chain of Custody Form. Upon receipt of the specimens, he immediately conducted physical, chemical, and confirmatory tests to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. In the Chemistry Report No. D-394-15 dated September 28, 2015, PCI De Guzman concluded that the contents of the two self-sealing transparent plastic bags tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. Similarly, in Chemistry Report No. DT-504-15 to DT-506-15, the test result showed that accused-appellant Glen tested positive for use of dangerous drugs.[26]

After the examination, PCI De Guzman placed his own markings and signature on the marked and sealed seized items. He then turned over the documents and the marked, sealed seized drugs to the evidence custodian.[27]

On February 29, 2016, PCI De Guzman personally retrieved the relevant documents and the marked and sealed seized items from the evidence custodian and presented them to the trial court.[28]

During trial, the prosecution and the defense stipulated that PCI De Guzman can identify the specimens which he subjected to qualitative examination through his own marking and signature.[29]



In defense, accused-appellants denied the accusations against them. For his part, accused-appellant Noel insisted that between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. of September 26, 2015, he and his wife Marivic Mendiola (Marivic) left their house to go to Divisoria on board a green Honda Civic. Before they proceeded to Divisoria, they fetched their son, accused-appellant Nhelmar, from his house. Accused-appellant Noel then left his car at accused-appellant Nhelmar’s house and used the latter’s black Honda Civic instead.[30]

At around 7:00 a.m., while they were in the area of Recto, Manila, three cars parked behind their car. Suddenly, several men alighted from their respective cars and approached accused-appellant Noel and his family. For no reason at all, the men arrested and handcuffed them. After a while, one of the armed men brought another man in handcuffs, who turned out to be accused-appellant Glen. The men brought all of them to Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.[31]

Accused-appellant Glen testified that on September 26, 2015, at around 7:30 a.m., he was at Sta. Cruz, Manila to fetch his common-law wife when armed men suddenly accosted him. They handcuffed him and forced him to board a white car. Later, they brought him to Camp Bagong Diwa.[32]



In the Decision[33] dated June 5, 2019, the RTC convicted all accused-appellants of violation of Section 5 of RA 9165 in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG. It sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and ordered them to pay a fine of P500,000.00 each. It likewise convicted accused-appellant Noel of violation of Section 11 of RA 9165 in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG. It sentenced him to suffer life imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of P500,000.00.[34]

Aggrieved, accused-appellants appealed to the CA.[35]



In the assailed Decision,[36] the CA affirmed in toto the RTC Decision convicting the accused-appellants.[37]

Hence, the instant appeal.[38]



Whether the CA correctly affirmed the conviction of accused-appellants.



The Court resolves to dismiss the appeal.

In Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG, the prosecution satisfactorily established the following elements of Illegal Sale of shabu: “(1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.”[39]

The pieces of evidence showed that accused-appellants conspired in selling and delivering a self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing 1050.68 grams of shabu to PO3 Mataverde in exchange for the marked money prepared by the buy-bust team. Thus, the sale of shabu was consummated, and all the elements constituting the illegal sale of dangerous drugs were present.

PO3 Mataverde identified accused-appellants as the persons who sold to him the subject illegal drugs after receiving the marked money.[40]

Likewise, in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG, the prosecution established the following elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs: “(1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.”[41]

After PO3 Mataverde apprehended accused-appellant Noel, he saw one black bag with one self-sealing plastic bag containing white crystalline substance. Later, the white crystalline substance was found to be shabu weighing 979.07 grams.[42] In other words, accused-appellant Noel was caught red-handed in possession of a significant amount of shabu without showing any proof that he was duly authorized to possess the drug. It is beyond doubt that the finding of illegal drugs in the vehicle occupied by a person raises the presumption of knowledge and possession thereof which, standing alone, is sufficient to convict the possessor.[43] Accused-appellant Noel failed to rebut this presumption. In addition, PO3 Mataverde positively identified accused-appellant Noel as the person from whom they recovered the bag of shabu weighing 979.07 grams.[44] Clearly, accused-appellant Noel is also guilty of Illegal Possession of Drugs.

Moreover, the buy-bust team complied with all the requirements provided in Section 21 of RA 9165.

The buy-bust operation that led to the arrest of accused-appellants was successfully conducted on September 27, 2015, or after the amendments to RA 9165 under RA 10640,[45] which became effective on August 7, 2014.[46] RA 10640 provides that the inventory and photographing be done in the presence of the accused from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as an elected public official and a representative of either the National Prosecution Service or the media.[47]

Here, records reveal that the police officers conducted the marking, inventory, and photographing at the place of arrest and in the presence of accused-appellants, media representative Mestica, Kagawad Dela Cruz, representatives from other media outlets such as ABS-CBN, GMA Network, and TV5, PCI Razon, assigned investigator SPO3 Aligier, NCRPO Regional Director Gen. Pagdilao, and DILG Secretary Sarmiento. The law enforcers further established that media representative Mestica and Kagawad Dela Cruz were near the place of arrest and readily available to witness the marking and inventory of the seized items.[48] The witnesses were present thereat and witnessed the marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized items and the actual proceedings conducted by the buy-bust team.

In Nisperos v. People[49] (Nisperos), the Court En Banc highlighted that the mandatory witnesses must be at or near the place of apprehension, or readily available thereat, to witness the immediately ensuing inventory. In the case at bench, the law enforcers evidently complied with the requirements emphasized by the Court in Nisperos.

It is likewise undisputed that at the place of arrest, PO3 Mataverde marked the red and white striped plastic bag with his initials “JRM”, the initials of the accused-appellant Nhelmar “NMM”, and the date “9/27/15.” Similarly, he marked its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, as “JRM/NMN-A 9/27/15.” He also marked the black bag with his initials and the initials of accused-appellant Noel, “JRM/NMP 9/27/15,” and its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, as “JRM/NMP-1 9/27/15.” The team took photographs of the seized items, and of the actual marking and inventory.[50]

It is evident that the police officers complied with the rules on marking, inventory, and photographing; and the witness requirements as mandated in Section 21 of RA 9165.

It is likewise beyond doubt that the rule on the chain of custody was observed by the buy-bust team and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.

“To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.”[51] The rule on chain of custody is in accordance with Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, series of 2002.[52]

In People v. Sipin,[53] the Court reiterated the links that must be established in the chain of custody in a buy-bust operation, to wit: (1) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officers; (2) the turnover of the illegal drug seized to the investigating officer; (3) the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and (4) the turnover and submission of the illegal drug from the forensic chemist to the court.[54]

Here, immediately after the marking and inventory at the place of arrest, SPO3 Aligier prepared the necessary documents and conducted an investigation of the seized items.[55] After the investigation, PO3 Mataverde turned over the marked and sealed seized items to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.[56]

PCI De Guzman, the forensic chemist, personally received the marked and sealed seized items, and the required documents (request for laboratory examination and chain of custody form). Upon receipt, he immediately conducted physical, chemical, and confirmatory tests thereof to determine the presence of dangerous drugs.[57] After examination, the specimens tested positive for shabu. Thereafter, PCI De Guzman placed his own markings and signature on the marked and sealed seized items. Then, he turned over the documents, and the marked and sealed seized items to the evidence custodian. Also, the prosecution and the defense stipulated that PCI De Guzman can identify the specimens which he subjected to qualitative examination through his own marking and signature.[58]

On February 29, 2016, PCI De Guzman personally retrieved from the evidence custodian the relevant documents, and the same marked (with his own markings and signatures) and sealed seized items; he presented them to the trial court.[59] To be sure, the records indicated that the illegal drugs confiscated during the buy-bust operation were segregated, marked, inventoried, kept, and delivered in such a way that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved until their presentation and identification in open court.

From the foregoing pieces of evidence, the buy-bust team had established all the links in the chain of custody. The chain of custody was not broken from the time of marking and inventory, to the examination in the laboratory, up to the presentation of the packs of shabu to the court. To prove all the links in the chain of custody, the law enforcers executed and presented the Inventory of Seized/Confiscated Item/Property, Chain of Custody Form, and the photographs taken during the marking and inventory.[60]

Besides, accused-appellants failed to present any evidence to show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the shabu presented at the trial had been compromised at some point.[61] On the contrary, the body of evidence adduced by the prosecution supports the conclusion that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved and safeguarded through an unbroken chain of custody.

Finally, the defense of denial is viewed with disfavor as a general rule because of the ease with which an accused can concoct it to suit his defense. Denial partakes of the nature of evidence that is both negative and self-serving; thus, it cannot be given more credence than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify clearly and lend credibility as to the various aspects of the crime committed.[62] As negative defenses, bare denials and accusations of frame-up, generally, cannot prevail over the affirmative testimonies of truthful witnesses.[63]

The foregoing principle applies in prosecutions for violations of RA 9165, especially those originating from buy-bust operations.[64] As the Court held in People v. Pasion:[65]

In such cases, the testimonies of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operations are generally accorded full faith and credit, in view of the presumption of regularity in the performance of public duties. Hence, when lined up against an unsubstantiated denial or claim of frame-up, the testimonies of the officers who caught the accused red-handed are given more weight and usually prevail.

In order to overcome the presumption of regularity, jurisprudence teaches Us that there must be clear and convincing evidence that the police officers did not properly perform their duties or that they were prompted with ill motive.[66] (Underscoring in the original)

Thus, in the absence of evidence of ill motive on the part of law enforcers to impute such serious crime against the accused-appellants that would deprive their liberty for a lifetime, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, as well as the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, shall prevail over accused-appellants’ self-serving claim of having been framed-up.[67]

As regards the penalty, the Court finds it proper to increase the fine imposed considering the quantity of shabu seized from accused-appellants. Thus, in addition to life imprisonment, a fine of P1,000,000.00 should be imposed against each of the accused-appellants in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG. Also, a fine of P1,000,000.00 should be imposed against accused-appellant Noel in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG.

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated January 15, 2021, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13666 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION:

1.
In Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG, accused-appellants Nhelmar Mendiola y Martin alias “Honda,” Noel Mendiola y Ponce alias “Noel,” and Glen Ramos y Akiatan alias “Glen,” are found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. Each of them is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of P1,000,000.00; and
2.
In Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG, accused-appellant Noel Mendiola y Ponce alias “Noel” is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine of P1,000,000.00.
SO ORDERED.

Caguioa (Chairperson), J., see concurring opinion.","Before the Court is an appeal[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated January 15, 2021, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13666. The CA affirmed the Decision[3] dated June 5, 2019, of Branch 164, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasig City in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG that found Nhelmar Mendiola y Martin alias “Honda” (accused-appellant Nhelmar), Noel Mendiola y Ponce alias “Noel” (accused-appellant Noel), and Glen Ramos y Akiatan alias “Glen” (accused-appellant Glen) (collectively, accused-appellants) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5,[4] Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165,[5] otherwise known as the “Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002,” as amended. The CA also affirmed accused-appellant Noel’s conviction in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG for violation of Section 11,[6] Article II of the same law.
The Antecedents

The instant case stemmed from two separate Informations in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG which charged accused-appellants with Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs; and Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG which charged accused-appellant Noel with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs. The accusatory portions of the two Informations state:

Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG

On or about September 27, 2015, in Pasig City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, conspiring and confederating together and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another, not being lawfully authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver, and give away to PO3 Jun Mataverde, a member of [the] Philippine National Police, who acted as police poseur buyer, one (1) double self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing 1050.68[7] grams of white crystalline substance, which was found positive to the test for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, in violation of said law.

Contrary to law.[8]

Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG

On or about September 27, 2015, in Pasig City, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, not being lawfully authorized to possess any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and under his custody and control one (1) double self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing 979.07 grams of white crystalline substance, which was found positive to the test of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, in violation of said law.

Contrary to law.[9]

Upon arraignment, accused-appellants entered a plea of “Not Guilty” to the respective charges.[10]

Trial ensued.

The prosecution established that on September 27, 2015, at around 5:00 a.m., a male confidential informant (CI) went to the Regional Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Group (RAID-SOTG) at Camp Bagong Diwa, Bicutan, Taguig City, and reported that a certain person known as “Honda” (later identified as accused-appellant Nhelmar) and his cohorts were involved in the rampant selling of illegal drugs in Pasig City. The CI informed Police Inspector Michael Yap (P/Insp. Yap) that they set a deal at 8:00 p.m. at the parking lot of Jollibee, Ortigas Extension, Brgy. Rosario, Pasig City. Thus, Police Chief Inspector Roberto Razon (PCI Razon) instructed P/Insp. Yap to form a buy-bust team.[11]

The team was composed of the following: P/Insp. Yap; Police Officer 3 Junjun Mataverde[12] (PO3 Mataverde), the poseur-buyer; Senior Police Officer 2 Nirbert E. Porlucas (SPO2 Porlucas), the arresting officer; and PO3 Neil Dumlao[13] (PO3 Dumlao) and SPO3 Rolando Aligier, Jr.[14] (SPO3 Aligier), the back-up officers.[15] P/Insp. Yap instructed the CI to arrange a transaction with the group of “Honda” and introduce PO3 Mataverde as a buyer of one kilogram of shabu. The buy-bust team coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and prepared the marked money. Afterwards, the team proceeded to the target area.[16]

At the target area, around 8:00 p.m., a green Honda Civic sedan with plate no. LDD-814 and a black Honda Civic sedan with plate no. UUY-594 arrived. A man (later identified as accused-appellant Nhelmar) alighted from the black Honda Civic. The CI approached accused-appellant Nhelmar and immediately introduced PO3 Mataverde as the buyer of shabu. Accused-appellant Nhelmar then called his companions who were inside the green Honda Civic. He instructed one of his companions, a long-haired male person (later identified as accused-appellant Glen) to get the striped plastic bag containing one kilogram of shabu from the passenger seat of the black Honda Civic. Meanwhile, the other cohort, an older man (later identified as accused-appellant Noel) uttered: “Ako na maglu-look out para sigurado.”[17]

Accused-appellant Glen took out the striped plastic bag from the black Honda Civic and handed it to PO3 Mataverde, who then opened it and saw inside a self-sealing plastic bag containing white crystalline substance suspected to be shabu. In exchange, PO3 Mataverde gave to accused-appellant Nhelmar a brown envelope containing the marked money. While accused-appellant Nhelmar was opening the brown envelope, PO3 Mataverde executed the pre-arranged signal. In no time, SPO2 Porlucas and PO3 Dumlao immediately rushed to the scene and assisted PO3 Mataverde in arresting all of the accused-appellants.[18]

SPO2 Porlucas then subjected accused-appellant Nhelmar to a body frisk. He confiscated from the latter’s possession one .38 caliber gun with five pieces of ammunition. PO3 Mataverde, on the other hand, apprehended accused-appellant Noel inside the green car and confiscated from him one black bag with one self-sealing plastic bag containing suspected shabu.[19]

After the police officers informed accused-appellants of their constitutional rights, they conducted the marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized items at the place of arrest in the presence of several witnesses. PO3 Mataverde marked the seized items as follows: (1) the red and white striped plastic bag with the markings “JRM/NMM 9/27/15,” (referring to his initials, the initials of accused-appellant Nhelmar, and the date of seizure) and its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, with the markings “JRM/NMM-A 9/27/15;” and (2) the black bag with the markings “JRM/NMP 9/27/15,” (his initials, the initials of accused-appellant Noel, and date of seizure), and its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, with the markings “JRM/NMP-1 9/27/15.” Meanwhile, SPO2 Porlucas marked the .38 caliber gun with the markings “NP/NMM 9/27/15” and the five pieces of live ammunition with “NP/NMM-1 9/27/15” to “NP/NMM-5 9/27/15.”[20]

PO3 Mataverde then conducted the inventory in the presence of the following: accused-appellants; Jun Mestica[21] (Mestica), media representative of Remate Tonite; and Barangay Kagawad Henry Dela Cruz (Kagawad Dela Cruz).[22]

The following also witnessed the conduct of the inventory: representatives from other media outlets, such as ABS-CBN, GMA Network, and TV5; SPO3 Aligier, the assigned investigator; PCI Razon; Director General Joel Pagdilao (Gen. Pagdilao) of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO); and Secretary Mel Senen Sarmiento (Secretary Sarmiento) of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).[23]

During the inventory at the place of arrest, the team took photographs of the seized items and accused-appellants.[24]

Thereafter, the police officers brought accused-appellants and the seized items to Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, for documentation.[25] SPO3 Aligier then prepared the necessary documents for the investigation. After the investigation, PO3 Mataverde turned over the marked and sealed seized items to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory. PCI Alejandro De Guzman (PCI De Guzman) received the marked and sealed seized specimen, the Request for Laboratory Examination, and the Chain of Custody Form. Upon receipt of the specimens, he immediately conducted physical, chemical, and confirmatory tests to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. In the Chemistry Report No. D-394-15 dated September 28, 2015, PCI De Guzman concluded that the contents of the two self-sealing transparent plastic bags tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. Similarly, in Chemistry Report No. DT-504-15 to DT-506-15, the test result showed that accused-appellant Glen tested positive for use of dangerous drugs.[26]

After the examination, PCI De Guzman placed his own markings and signature on the marked and sealed seized items. He then turned over the documents and the marked, sealed seized drugs to the evidence custodian.[27]

On February 29, 2016, PCI De Guzman personally retrieved the relevant documents and the marked and sealed seized items from the evidence custodian and presented them to the trial court.[28]

During trial, the prosecution and the defense stipulated that PCI De Guzman can identify the specimens which he subjected to qualitative examination through his own marking and signature.[29]

In defense, accused-appellants denied the accusations against them. For his part, accused-appellant Noel insisted that between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. of September 26, 2015, he and his wife Marivic Mendiola (Marivic) left their house to go to Divisoria on board a green Honda Civic. Before they proceeded to Divisoria, they fetched their son, accused-appellant Nhelmar, from his house. Accused-appellant Noel then left his car at accused-appellant Nhelmar’s house and used the latter’s black Honda Civic instead.[30]

At around 7:00 a.m., while they were in the area of Recto, Manila, three cars parked behind their car. Suddenly, several men alighted from their respective cars and approached accused-appellant Noel and his family. For no reason at all, the men arrested and handcuffed them. After a while, one of the armed men brought another man in handcuffs, who turned out to be accused-appellant Glen. The men brought all of them to Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.[31]

Accused-appellant Glen testified that on September 26, 2015, at around 7:30 a.m., he was at Sta. Cruz, Manila to fetch his common-law wife when armed men suddenly accosted him. They handcuffed him and forced him to board a white car. Later, they brought him to Camp Bagong Diwa.[32]",Whether the CA correctly affirmed the conviction of accused-appellants.,"In the Decision[33] dated June 5, 2019, the RTC convicted all accused-appellants of violation of Section 5 of RA 9165 in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG. It sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and ordered them to pay a fine of P500,000.00 each. It likewise convicted accused-appellant Noel of violation of Section 11 of RA 9165 in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG. It sentenced him to suffer life imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of P500,000.00.[34]

Aggrieved, accused-appellants appealed to the CA.[35]

The Ruling of the CA

In the assailed Decision,[36] the CA affirmed in toto the RTC Decision convicting the accused-appellants.[37]

Hence, the instant appeal.[38]

The Court resolves to dismiss the appeal.

In Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG, the prosecution satisfactorily established the following elements of Illegal Sale of shabu: “(1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.”[39]

The pieces of evidence showed that accused-appellants conspired in selling and delivering a self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing 1050.68 grams of shabu to PO3 Mataverde in exchange for the marked money prepared by the buy-bust team. Thus, the sale of shabu was consummated, and all the elements constituting the illegal sale of dangerous drugs were present.

PO3 Mataverde identified accused-appellants as the persons who sold to him the subject illegal drugs after receiving the marked money.[40]

Likewise, in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG, the prosecution established the following elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs: “(1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.”[41]

After PO3 Mataverde apprehended accused-appellant Noel, he saw one black bag with one self-sealing plastic bag containing white crystalline substance. Later, the white crystalline substance was found to be shabu weighing 979.07 grams.[42] In other words, accused-appellant Noel was caught red-handed in possession of a significant amount of shabu without showing any proof that he was duly authorized to possess the drug. It is beyond doubt that the finding of illegal drugs in the vehicle occupied by a person raises the presumption of knowledge and possession thereof which, standing alone, is sufficient to convict the possessor.[43] Accused-appellant Noel failed to rebut this presumption. In addition, PO3 Mataverde positively identified accused-appellant Noel as the person from whom they recovered the bag of shabu weighing 979.07 grams.[44] Clearly, accused-appellant Noel is also guilty of Illegal Possession of Drugs.

Moreover, the buy-bust team complied with all the requirements provided in Section 21 of RA 9165.

The buy-bust operation that led to the arrest of accused-appellants was successfully conducted on September 27, 2015, or after the amendments to RA 9165 under RA 10640,[45] which became effective on August 7, 2014.[46] RA 10640 provides that the inventory and photographing be done in the presence of the accused from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as an elected public official and a representative of either the National Prosecution Service or the media.[47]

Here, records reveal that the police officers conducted the marking, inventory, and photographing at the place of arrest and in the presence of accused-appellants, media representative Mestica, Kagawad Dela Cruz, representatives from other media outlets such as ABS-CBN, GMA Network, and TV5, PCI Razon, assigned investigator SPO3 Aligier, NCRPO Regional Director Gen. Pagdilao, and DILG Secretary Sarmiento. The law enforcers further established that media representative Mestica and Kagawad Dela Cruz were near the place of arrest and readily available to witness the marking and inventory of the seized items.[48] The witnesses were present thereat and witnessed the marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized items and the actual proceedings conducted by the buy-bust team.

In Nisperos v. People[49] (Nisperos), the Court En Banc highlighted that the mandatory witnesses must be at or near the place of apprehension, or readily available thereat, to witness the immediately ensuing inventory. In the case at bench, the law enforcers evidently complied with the requirements emphasized by the Court in Nisperos.

It is likewise undisputed that at the place of arrest, PO3 Mataverde marked the red and white striped plastic bag with his initials “JRM”, the initials of the accused-appellant Nhelmar “NMM”, and the date “9/27/15.” Similarly, he marked its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, as “JRM/NMN-A 9/27/15.” He also marked the black bag with his initials and the initials of accused-appellant Noel, “JRM/NMP 9/27/15,” and its content, which is one self-sealing transparent plastic bag containing shabu, as “JRM/NMP-1 9/27/15.” The team took photographs of the seized items, and of the actual marking and inventory.[50]

It is evident that the police officers complied with the rules on marking, inventory, and photographing; and the witness requirements as mandated in Section 21 of RA 9165.

It is likewise beyond doubt that the rule on the chain of custody was observed by the buy-bust team and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.

“To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.”[51] The rule on chain of custody is in accordance with Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, series of 2002.[52]

In People v. Sipin,[53] the Court reiterated the links that must be established in the chain of custody in a buy-bust operation, to wit: (1) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officers; (2) the turnover of the illegal drug seized to the investigating officer; (3) the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and (4) the turnover and submission of the illegal drug from the forensic chemist to the court.[54]

Here, immediately after the marking and inventory at the place of arrest, SPO3 Aligier prepared the necessary documents and conducted an investigation of the seized items.[55] After the investigation, PO3 Mataverde turned over the marked and sealed seized items to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.[56]

PCI De Guzman, the forensic chemist, personally received the marked and sealed seized items, and the required documents (request for laboratory examination and chain of custody form). Upon receipt, he immediately conducted physical, chemical, and confirmatory tests thereof to determine the presence of dangerous drugs.[57] After examination, the specimens tested positive for shabu. Thereafter, PCI De Guzman placed his own markings and signature on the marked and sealed seized items. Then, he turned over the documents, and the marked and sealed seized items to the evidence custodian. Also, the prosecution and the defense stipulated that PCI De Guzman can identify the specimens which he subjected to qualitative examination through his own marking and signature.[58]

On February 29, 2016, PCI De Guzman personally retrieved from the evidence custodian the relevant documents, and the same marked (with his own markings and signatures) and sealed seized items; he presented them to the trial court.[59] To be sure, the records indicated that the illegal drugs confiscated during the buy-bust operation were segregated, marked, inventoried, kept, and delivered in such a way that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved until their presentation and identification in open court.

From the foregoing pieces of evidence, the buy-bust team had established all the links in the chain of custody. The chain of custody was not broken from the time of marking and inventory, to the examination in the laboratory, up to the presentation of the packs of shabu to the court. To prove all the links in the chain of custody, the law enforcers executed and presented the Inventory of Seized/Confiscated Item/Property, Chain of Custody Form, and the photographs taken during the marking and inventory.[60]

Besides, accused-appellants failed to present any evidence to show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the shabu presented at the trial had been compromised at some point.[61] On the contrary, the body of evidence adduced by the prosecution supports the conclusion that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved and safeguarded through an unbroken chain of custody.

Finally, the defense of denial is viewed with disfavor as a general rule because of the ease with which an accused can concoct it to suit his defense. Denial partakes of the nature of evidence that is both negative and self-serving; thus, it cannot be given more credence than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify clearly and lend credibility as to the various aspects of the crime committed.[62] As negative defenses, bare denials and accusations of frame-up, generally, cannot prevail over the affirmative testimonies of truthful witnesses.[63]

The foregoing principle applies in prosecutions for violations of RA 9165, especially those originating from buy-bust operations.[64] As the Court held in People v. Pasion:[65]

In such cases, the testimonies of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operations are generally accorded full faith and credit, in view of the presumption of regularity in the performance of public duties. Hence, when lined up against an unsubstantiated denial or claim of frame-up, the testimonies of the officers who caught the accused red-handed are given more weight and usually prevail.

In order to overcome the presumption of regularity, jurisprudence teaches Us that there must be clear and convincing evidence that the police officers did not properly perform their duties or that they were prompted with ill motive.[66] (Underscoring in the original)

Thus, in the absence of evidence of ill motive on the part of law enforcers to impute such serious crime against the accused-appellants that would deprive their liberty for a lifetime, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, as well as the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, shall prevail over accused-appellants’ self-serving claim of having been framed-up.[67]

As regards the penalty, the Court finds it proper to increase the fine imposed considering the quantity of shabu seized from accused-appellants. Thus, in addition to life imprisonment, a fine of P1,000,000.00 should be imposed against each of the accused-appellants in Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG. Also, a fine of P1,000,000.00 should be imposed against accused-appellant Noel in Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG.

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated January 15, 2021, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 13666 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION:

1.
In Criminal Case No. 20724-D-PSG, accused-appellants Nhelmar Mendiola y Martin alias “Honda,” Noel Mendiola y Ponce alias “Noel,” and Glen Ramos y Akiatan alias “Glen,” are found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. Each of them is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of P1,000,000.00; and
2.
In Criminal Case No. 20725-D-PSG, accused-appellant Noel Mendiola y Ponce alias “Noel” is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. He is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine of P1,000,000.00.
SO ORDERED.

[ G.R. No. 251463. August 02, 2023 ]
GRANDSPAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. FRANKLIN BAKER, INC. AND ADVANCE ENGINEERING CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



GAERLAN, J.:
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed to assail the Decision[2] dated March 15, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated January 15, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 110751. Said rulings of the CA modified (but basically affirmed) the Orders dated December 13, 2017[4] and March 7, 2018[5] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 66 in Civil Case No. R-MKT-17-01339-CV. Said Orders of the trial court essentially dismissed Grandspan Development Corporation’s (petitioner) Complaint[6] for Sum of Money against Franklin Baker, Inc. (FBI) and Advance Engineering Corporation (AEC; collectively, respondents) on the ground of the said trial court’s lack of jurisdiction over the case.


Respondents entered into a Construction Contract[7] notarized on July 8, 2015 (with Contract No. FBI-ICC-03) for the construction of the Integrated Coconut Products Processing Plant located in Barangay Darong, Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur. The terms of the said Construction Contract specified that FBI agreed to award the construction of the plant to AEC, an independent and legitimate job contractor, for the total contract price of P465 million. Article VIII[8] of the Construction Contract allowed AEC to assign any component of the scope of work to a subcontractor with FBI’s consent, whilst Article XVI[9] thereof had the following stipulation on dispute resolution:
In any event any dispute shall arise between the Parties with respect to any of the terms and conditions of the CONTRACT, the duly authorized representatives of the Parties shall meet as promptly as practicable after notice of such dispute to resolve in good faith such dispute.

Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising from or in relation to the CONTRACT shall first be settled amicably between the Parties, and if the Parties fail thereat, by arbitration in accordance with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. Arbitration Rules. The arbitration panel shall be composed of three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall designate an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators designated shall select a third arbitrator who will act as the presiding arbitrator. The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and executory unless properly set aside by a competent court on grounds allowed by law. The costs of arbitration shall be divided between the Parties. The arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in Makati City, Philippines, unless the nature of the hearing and the evidence sought to be presented will require the conduct of arbitral proceedings other than the aforesaid venue [sic].[10]

AEC did in fact subcontract to petitioner the provision of labor, materials, tools, equipment, technical supervision, testing, and commissioning of certain structural works on the plant through a Subcontractor’s Agreement[11] dated June 9, 2015.[12] The total contract price payable to petitioner for performance of the subcontracted services was P59,875,046.52, and critically, Item 29 of the Subcontractor’s Agreement stated the following:

29. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE. This Contract shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. If any disagreement or dispute arises between the parties, regarding the work subject matter of this sub-contract or from the interpretation of the contract and the documents appended thereto, and the parties are unable to resolve the disagreement between themselves, the same shall be submitted for arbitration by either party to the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission applying the Construction Industry Arbitration Law of the Philippines. The Arbitration process shall not constitute a reason for the SUB-CONTRACTOR to suspend construction of the work nor shall it affect the contract period/duration.[13]

In its Complaint filed before the trial court on April 25, 2017, petitioner alleged that the total revised contract price for the subcontracted services had ballooned to P97,843,917.00 (as of November 2016),[14] with AEC having only paid P44,975,009.30 as of October 3, 2016.[15] This supposedly left an unpaid balance of P53,206,359.76, exclusive of accompanying interest.[16] The Complaint indicates that petitioner sent its final demand to both Respondents on November 29, 2016.[17] Petitioner also apparently impleaded FBI pursuant to Article 1729 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 386, otherwise known as the “Civil Code of the Philippines,” viz.:

Article 1729. Those who put their labor upon or furnish materials for a piece of work undertaken by the contractor have an action against the owner up to the amount owing from the latter to the contractor at the time the claim is made. However, the following shall not prejudice the laborers, employees and furnishers of materials:

(1) Payments made by the owner to the contractor before they are due;

(2) Renunciation by the contractor of any amount due him from the owner.

This Article is subject to the provisions of special laws. (Emphasis, italics, and underscoring supplied)

FBI duly filed its Motion to Dismiss,[18] which outlined among other grounds the fact that jurisdiction over the case properly lied with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. (PDRCI) in accordance with Article XVI of the Construction Contract. Moreover, FBI argued that petitioner failed to prove that the former did indeed owe a sum of money relative to the construction to AEC, which the latter asserts is a condition precedent for the applicability of Article 1729 of the Civil Code.

AEC also duly filed its Answer,[19] which asserted a cross-claim against FBI for the latter’s unpaid balance relative to the Construction Contract totaling P258,612,291.24,[20] and critically invoked Item 29 of its Subcontractor’s Agreement with petitioner for the dismissal of the latter’s Complaint. In effect, AEC invoked the primary, exclusive, and original jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC).


In its Order dated December 13, 2017, the RTC dismissed both the Complaint and AEC’s cross-claim without prejudice, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Dismiss Cross Claim are hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, the instant case and the cross claim of defendant AEC are hereby DISMISSED without prejudice.

SO ORDERED.[21]

The trial court reasoned that both the Construction Contract between respondents and the Subcontractor’s Agreement between AEC and petitioner precluded the jurisdiction of the regular courts due to the primary jurisdiction of arbitral bodies duly stipulated by the parties. Said the trial court: “[t]he only sound conclusion is that as of this juncture, this Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim as well as the cross­claim. The parties must first undergo arbitration as agreed upon in their respective contracts.”[22]

Petitioner duly filed its Motion for Reconsideration,[23] invoking the lack of privity of contract it has vis-à-vis respondents’ Construction Contract, as well as the primacy of Article 1729 of the Civil Code over the Subcontractor’s Agreement. Simply put, petitioner asserted that even if the provisions of Item 29 of the Subcontractor’s Agreement are clear, petitioner could still sue respondents before the regular courts.

In its Order dated March 7, 2018, the trial court effectively denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration in the following manner:

WHEREFORE, considering that this Court has no jurisdiction over construction disputes, the parties are directed to initiate the proper arbitration proceedings before the CIAC to resolve their respective construction disputes.

In the meantime, the proceedings in the instant case are hereby suspended until the CIAC has made a final determination on the following construction disputes:

Liability, if any, of defendant AEC to the Plaintiff under their Sub-Contractor Agreement;
Liability, if any, of defendant AEC to defendant FBI under their Construction Contract; and/or
Liability, if any, of defendant FBI to defendant AEC under their Construction Contract.
SO ORDERED.[24]

Aggrieved, petitioner appealed the aforementioned Orders to the CA.



In its Decision dated March 15, 2019, the CA dismissed petitioner’s appeal, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISSED. The assailed Orders dated December 13, 2017 and March 7, 2018 issued by the RTC of Makati City, Branch 66 in Civil Case No. R-MKT-17-01339-CV are accordingly MODIFIED in that the RTC is directed to dismiss the case and refer the construction dispute/s among GDC, AEC and FBI to arbitration before the CIAC.

SO ORDERED.[25]

The appellate court basically reasoned that the arbitration clauses in both the Construction Contract between respondents and the Subcontractor’s Agreement between petitioner and AEC prevailed over the general provisions of Article 1729 of the Civil Code. Additionally, Rule 17.7 of A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC,[26] otherwise known as the “Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution” (ADR), authorizes a trial court to “issue an order directing the inclusion in arbitration of those parties who are bound by the arbitration agreement directly or by reference thereto.” Trial courts are further authorized by the said rule to dismiss cases and make referrals to the CIAC arbitration even if “[n]ot all of the parties to the civil action are bound by the arbitration agreement and referral to arbitration would result in multiplicity of suits.” Thus, the CA ruled that the RTC should have ordered the referral to the CIAC along with its dismissal of the case.

Petitioner duly filed its Motion for Reconsideration,[27] which insisted anew that Article 1729 of the Civil Code prevailed over the arbitration clauses, and that it had no privity of contract vis-à-vis respondents’ Construction Contract. Petitioner clarified that its action against respondents was simply a money claim cognizable before the regular courts, not a construction dispute cognizable before the CIAC.

In its Resolution dated January 15, 2020, the CA denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration in the following manner:

All told, the plaintiff-appellant GDC failed to convince Us to reconsider Our Decision dated March 15, 2019. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration dated April 16, 2019 filed by plaintiff-appellant is DENIED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.[28]

Hence, the instant petition.



Petitioner basically reiterates its argument that Article 1729 of the Civil Code gives it a right of action against respondents before the regular courts, despite the arbitration clauses in both the Construction Contract and the Subcontractor’s Agreement. Said Article 1729 of the Civil Code, to petitioner, is deemed written into the said agreements, and should prevail over the arbitration clauses in terms of vesting jurisdiction with the regular courts.
In its Comment/Opposition,[29] FBI cited the relatively recent case of Tourism Infrastructure & Enterprise Zone Authority v. Global-V Builders Co.,[30] which reiterated the Court’s ruling in Hutama-Rsea Joint Operations, Inc. v. Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corp.,[31] that the mere existence of an arbitration clause in a construction contract would already and automatically vest the CIAC with jurisdiction over the related dispute. FBI also asserts that relative to petitioner’s invocation of Article 1729 of the Civil Code, any of the farmer’s liability to the latter under said provision is still premised on the determination of any amount due AEC from FBI. This could only be determined in proper proceedings before the CIAC.

AEC’s right to file its comment was deemed waived by the Court in its Resolution dated March 29, 2023.


For the Court’s adjudication are the following two issues:
1)
Whether petitioner’s Complaint against AEC is subject to the CIAC jurisdiction; and
2)
Whether petitioner could validly implead FBI in the same complaint pursuant to Article 1729 of the Civil Code
At this stage, the Court deems it important to note that the propriety of the trial court’s dismissal of ABC’s cross-claim against FBI could no longer be raised as an issue, since AEC failed to file its comment. Moreover, said cross-claim is actually irrelevant to the instant petition and without prejudice to AEC’s participation in the CIAC arbitration proceedings, as will be discussed below.



The instant petition merits a denial.
Anent the first issue, there is neither doubt nor dispute that petitioner and AEC entered into their Subcontractor’s Agreement, which indeed contained an arbitration clause as embodied in the said Agreement’s Item 29. Section 4 of Executive Order No. (E.O.) 1008, which created the CIAC, provides the following:

Section 4. Jurisdiction. – The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.

The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include, but is not limited to, violations of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of the terms of agreement; interpretation and/or application of contractual time and delays; maintenance and defects; payment default of employer or contractor and changes in contract cost.

Excluded from the coverage of this law are disputes arising from employer-employee relationships, which shall continue to be covered by the Labor Code of the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)

Said requirement is also reflected in Rule 2, Section 2.3 of the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration, which mandates that “[f]or the CIAC to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must be bound by an arbitration agreement in their contract or subsequently agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.” There being a clear, unambiguous, valid, and subsisting stipulation for the CIAC arbitration here between petitioner and ABC, the trial court was thus correct and justified in dismissing the Complaint with respect to AEC and referring the same to the CIAC pursuant to Rule 17 of the Special Rules of Court on ADR.

The crux of the matter, however, lies in the Court’s resolution of the second issue, i.e., the correctness of the appellate court’s affirmation of the trial court’s interpretation of Article 1729 of the Civil Code – as juxtaposed with the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudential precedents on the CIAC jurisdiction. Verily, the question is put to bear: Was petitioner’s impleading of FBI in the Complaint below anchored on any legal basis?

Jurisprudence provides a guide as to the intent behind the said Civil Code provision. In Velasco v. Court of Appeals,[32] the Court said thus:

x x x The intention of the latter provision is to protect the laborers and the materialmen from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous contractors and from possible connivance between owners and contractors. Thus, a constructive vinculum or contractual privity is created by this provision, by way of exception to the principle underlying Article 1311[33] [of the Civil Code] between the owner, on the one hand, and those who furnish labor and/or materials, on the other.[34]

In JL Investment & Development, Inc. v. Tendon Philippines, Inc.,[35] the Court explained the direct and solidary liability created by Article 1729 of the Civil Code and imposed upon both the owner of a piece of work and the contractor in favor of a subcontractor who supplied materials and labor for the creation of the said piece of work, viz.:

This provision imposes a direct liability on an owner of a piece of work in favor of suppliers of materials (and laborers) hired by the contractor “up to the amount owing from the [owner] to the contractor at the time the claim is made.” Thus, to this extent, the owner’s liability is solidary with the contractor, if both are sued together. By creating a constructive vinculum between suppliers of materials (and laborers), on the one hand, and the owner of a piece of work, on the other hand, as an exception to the rule on privity of contracts, Article 1729 protects suppliers of materials (and laborers) from unscrupulous contractors and possible connivance between owners and contractors. As the Court of Appeals correctly ruled, the supplier’s cause of action under this provision, reckoned from the time of judicial or extra-judicial demand, subsists so long as any amount remains owing from the owner to the contractor. Only full payment of the agreed contract price serves as a defense against the supplier’s claim.[36] (Citations omitted)

Also, in Noell Whessoe, Inc. v. Independent Testing Consultants, Inc.,[37] the Court noted that the only defense that can defeat a claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code is when the subcontractor has already been fully paid for services rendered, to wit:

However, Article 1729, while serving as an exception to the general rule on the privity of contracts, likewise provides for an exception to this exception. The contractor is solidarily liable with the owner and subcontractor for any liabilities against a supplier despite the absence of contract between the contractor and supplier, except when the subcontractor has already been fully paid for its services.[38] (Italics in the original)

Applying the foregoing principle to the instant petition, FBI’s only defense would have been that it had already paid AEC in full under their Construction Contract. However, in its Motion to Dismiss, FBI asserted that the burden of proving said full payment fell on petitioner – an assertion to which the Court most assiduously disagrees.

Since Article 1729 of the Civil Code is in the nature of a solidary obligation, the defense of payment is actually a matter of evidence that rests on the debtor invoking it – not on the creditor filing a claim against a solidary obligor. In Bognot v. RRI Lending Corp.,[39] the Court held thus:

Jurisprudence tells us that one who pleads payment has the burden of proving it; the burden rests on the defendant to prove payment, rather than on the plaintiff to prove non-payment. Indeed, once the existence of an indebtedness is duly established by evidence, the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment rests on the debtor.[40]

At this point, the Court must emphasize that there is neither statutory nor jurisprudential basis for FBI’s assertion that there must first be a determination that it owes AEC any amount before petitioner could file its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code. Properly speaking, it is incumbent upon FBI to assert that it has no more amount due AEC as a defense – not the other way around, whereby petitioner is unduly burdened with proving the fact of said remaining balance precisely because it has no privity of contract relative to the agreement between FBI and AEC under their Construction Contract. Common sense and sound equity dictate that petitioner should not be made to prove FBI’s indebtedness to AEC, but instead that FBI be on guard in defending itself by positively asserting and proving that it had already paid AEC in full, or at least up to the amount that petitioner was due at the time of the filing of the Complaint. Otherwise, Article 1729 – as a veritable and equitable protection crafted precisely for entities like petitioner – would essentially become nothing more than hollow words and dead letter. Verily, interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat.

This brings up the next critical question: Was Article 1729 of the Civil Code effectively amended or repealed by the jurisdiction of the CIAC?

Although E.O. No. 1008 has a general boilerplate repealing clause (i.e., Section 23[41] thereof), there is no specific mention of either the Civil Code or Article 1729 thereof in the entire E.O. In Mecano v. Commission on Audit,[42] the Court discussed the nature of such general repealing provisions when it dealt with a conflict between the old and the new (and currently subsisting) Administrative Codes, viz.:

The question that should be asked is: What is the nature of this repealing clause? It is certainly not an express repealing clause because it fails to identify or designate the act or acts that are intended to be repealed. Rather, it is an example of a general repealing provision, as stated in Opinion No. 73, s. 1991. It is a clause which predicates the intended repeal under the condition that a substantial conflict must be found in existing and prior acts. The failure to add a specific repealing clause indicates that the intent was not to repeal any existing law, unless an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy exists in terms of the new and old laws.[43] (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)

The Court also expounded in the said case the doctrine of repeal by implication, to wit:

Repeal by implication proceeds on the premise that where a statute of later date clearly reveals an intention on the part of the legislature to abrogate a prior act on the subject, that intention must be given effect. Hence, before there can be a repeal, there must be a clear showing on the part of the lawmaker that the intent in enacting the new law was to abrogate the old one. The intention to repeal must be clear and manifest; otherwise, at least, as a general rule, the later act is to be construed as a continuation of, and not a substitute for, the first act and will continue so far as the two acts are the same from the time of the first enactment.

There are two categories of repeal by implication. The first is where provisions in the two acts on the same subject matter are in an irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one. The second is if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate to repeal the earlier law.

Implied repeal by irreconcilable inconsistency takes place when the two statutes cover the same subject matter; they are so clearly inconsistent and incompatible with each other that they cannot be reconciled or harmonized; and both cannot be given effect, that is, that one law cannot be enforced without nullifying the other.[44] (Citations omitted, emphasis and underscore supplied)

As for the doctrine of amendment by implication, the eminent commentator Ruben E. Agpalo (Agpalo) has consistently stated, thus:

An amendment by implication is neither presumed nor favored. On the contrary, every statute should be harmonized with other laws on the same subject, in the absence of a clear inconsistency between them. The legislative intent to amend a prior law on the same subject is usually shown by a statement in the later act that any provision of law which is inconsistent therewith is modified accordingly. The absence of such a provision in the statute does not, however, mean that the subsequent law may no longer operate to amend or modify a prior act on the same subject; it so operates as long as there is an irreconcilable repugnancy between them.

There is an implied amendment where a part of a prior statute embracing the same subject as the later act may not be enforced without nullifying the pertinent provision of the latter, in which event, the prior act is deemed amended or modified to the extent of the repugnancy.[45]

Indeed, Article 1729 of the Civil Code and Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008 both relate to actions and disputes relative to liabilities for unpaid services, materials, and labor in construction contracts. Thus, they are statutory provisions in pari materia. Agpalo elucidates thus on how to properly construe such statutory provisions, viz.:

The rule is that a statute should be so construed not only to be consistent with itself but also to harmonize with other laws on the same subject matter, as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system. The rule is expressed in the maxim, interpretare et concordare leges legibus est optimus interpretandi modus, or every statute must be so construed and harmonized with other statutes as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. Consistency in statutes as in executive issuances is of prime importance, and, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, all laws are presumed to be consistent with each other. Where it is possible to do so, it is the duty of courts, in the construction of statutes, to harmonize and reconcile them, and to adopt a construction of a statutory provision which harmonizes and reconciles it with other statutory provisions.

Stated differently, every statute should be construed in such a way that will harmonize it with existing laws. To interpret and to do it in such a way as to harmonize laws with laws is the best mode of interpretation.[46] (Citations omitted)

Agpalo goes on:

Statutes in pari materia should be construed together to attain the purpose of an express national policy. For the assumption is that whenever the legislature enacts a law, it has in mind the previous statutes relating to the same subject matter, and in the absence of any express repeal or amendment, the new statute is deemed enacted in accord with the legislative policy embodied in those prior statutes. Provisions in an act which are omitted in another act relative to the same subject matter will be applied in a proceeding under the other act, when not inconsistent with its purpose. Prior statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be compared with the new provisions, and if possible by reasonable construction, both to be construed that effect is given to every provision of each. Statutes in pari materia, although in apparent conflict, are as far as reasonably possible construed to be in harmony with each other. Similarly, every new statute should be construed in connection those already existing in relation to the same subject matter and all should be made to harmonize and stand together, if they can be done by any fair and reasonable interpretation. Interpretare et concordare leges legibus, est optimus interpretandi modus, which means that the best method of interpretation is that which makes laws consistent with other laws. Accordingly, courts of justice, when confronted with apparently conflicting statutes, should endeavor to reconcile them instead of declaring outright the invalidity of one against the other. Courts should harmonize them, if this is possible, because they are equally the handiwork of the same legislature.[47] (Citations omitted, emphases supplied)

Finally, and to belabor the point further, Agpalo combines the principles of construing statutes in pari materia with the doctrines of implied repeal and amendment, to wit:

In cases involving harmonization of two or more laws relating to the same subject matter, the usual question is whether the later act has impliedly amended or repealed the earlier statute. A statute will not, however, be construed as repealing [a] prior act or acts on the same subject in the absence of words to that effect, unless there is an irreconcilable repugnancy between them or unless the new law is evidently intended to supersede all prior acts on the matter and to comprise itself the sole and complete system of legislation on the subject. The rule in this connection is that in case of doubt, the doubt will be resolved against implied amendment or repeal and in favor of harmonization of all laws on the subject. And assuming that there is an implied amendment, the latter [sic] statute should be so construed as to modify the prior law on the subject no further than may be necessary to effect the specific purpose of the latter [sic] enactment.[48] (Citations omitted, emphases supplied)

Indeed, the Court sees no reason to conclude that it was the President’s intention in 1985, when he promulgated E.O. No. 1008, to do away with the statutory protection afforded to suppliers of labor and materials for a piece of work as embodied in Article 1729 of the Civil Code. In keeping with the aforementioned principles of statutory construction, the Court deems it proper to construe the provision on CIAC’s jurisdiction in harmony with Article 1729 of the Civil Code, since both provisions can indeed exist and operate in harmony together.

To operationalize this vis-à-vis the instant petition, the Court recognizes that indeed, petitioner has a valid right under Article 1729 of the Civil Code to proceed against both respondents for the satisfaction of AEC’s remaining liabilities under the Subcontractor’s Agreement. However, how petitioner may proceed with said claim must be seen to have been modified accordingly by the CIAC’s jurisdiction.

This is because petitioner, as subcontractor, is an assignee of the Construction Contract. Even if Article VIII of the Construction Contract between FBI and AEC necessitates the written consent of FBI (as owner) before any assignment of any component of the scope of works could be done by AEC, there is no allegation here of FBI’s lack of consent. Thus, FBI is deemed to have admitted to consenting to AEC’s subcontracting to petitioner. In relation to petitioner’s status as an assignee of the Construction Contract, the commentator Custodio O. Parlade notes the following in two of his seminal treatises, viz.:

The assignment of a construction contract containing an arbitration clause, executed by a contractor in favor of its subcontractor with the approval of the owner, had the effect of making the subcontractor the owner’s contractor, bound by the terms and conditions of the assigned contract. The construction contract contained an arbitration clause under which the owner agreed that disputes arising from the contract shall be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration agreement provided, however, that it shall [be] applicable to, and may be invoked only by, a foreign contractor, the original contractor being a foreign company. The Commission interpreted the assignment to be limited to the construction contract excluding its arbitration clause as the subcontractor was not a foreign company.[49] (Emphasis supplied)

The Court sees no reason why this interpretation should not be applied to the instant petition. ln fact, this would amply facilitate how petitioner could enforce its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code whilst keeping to the letter and spirit of the CIAC’s jurisdiction under E.O. No. 1008. Verily, this means that petitioner is effectively subrogated in AEC’s place to invoke the arbitration clause of the original Construction Contract. Even if the Construction Contract’s arbitration clause explicitly refers to PDRCI as the arbitral body, Rule 4, Section 4.1 of the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration is also explicit, viz.:

Section 4.1. Submission to CIAC jurisdiction. – An arbitration clause in a construction contract or a submission to arbitration of a construction dispute shall be deemed an agreement to submit an existing or future controversy to CIAC jurisdiction, notwithstanding the reference to a different arbitration institution or arbitral body in such contract or submission.[50]

Thus, petitioner effectively still had to invoke the CIAC’s jurisdiction relative to its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code. This is also in keeping with the maxim that any doubt should be resolved and liberally construed in favor of arbitration or arbitrability, as emphasized by the Court in LM Power Engineering Corp. v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc.[51] and Camp John Hay Development Corp. v. Charter Chemical & Coating Corp.[52] The Court also sees this as the wiser route for petitioner’s claims against respondents, since severing the claims from each other, i.e., with one being tried before a regular court and the other being adjudicated by the CIAC, would be an unduly burdensome instance of splitting causes of action. It would thus be better in the interest of justice for the CIAC to jointly rule on the solidary liabilities of both respondents, with the parties having every right to appeal the same.

In any case, the CIAC’s plenary jurisdiction over the construction dispute at bar prevails due to the fact that petitioner’s claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code against FBI arose in relation to, and ultimately on account of, the Subcontractor’s Agreement with AEC. Without said Subcontractor’s Agreement, petitioner would have no cause of action at all against FBI. The very terms of Item 29 of the Subcontractor’s Agreement are clear: “any dispute arising from the Subcontractor’s Agreement is first cognizable before the CIAC.” Thus, with the claim being one that emanates directly from a breach of the Subcontractor’s Agreement itself, the CIAC properly has primary, exclusive, and original jurisdiction over petitioner’s cause of action against FBI under Article 1729 of the Civil Code – even if, and especially because, petitioner has no privity of contract with FBI. Moreover, Section 35 of R.A. No. 9285, otherwise known as the “Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004,” provides for the plenary and all-encompassing coverage of construction industry-related disputes arising among parties such as project owners, contractors, and subcontractors, viz.:

Section 35. Coverage of the Law. – Construction disputes which fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) shall include those between or among parties to, or who are otherwise bound by, an arbitration agreement, directly or by reference, whether such parties are project owner, contractor, subcontractor, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer of an insurance policy in a construction project.

The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is “commercial” pursuant to Section 21 of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)

Again, in order to harmonize this with Article 1729 of the Civil Code and Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008, the Court deems it wise to view this as a veritable jurisdictional “magnet” that pulls in even claims put forth by subcontractors against project owners – even if there be no contractual privity between them. As long as the project owner’s agreement with the contractor provides for (or leads to) the CIAC’s arbitral jurisdiction, and as long as the subcontractor’s agreement also provides for the same, the CIAC then has arbitral jurisdiction over claims made by the subcontractor against both the project owner and the contractor.

In effect, the trial court was thus correct in its dismissal of petitioner’s Complaint, and the appellate court was thus also correct in amending the dispositive portion of the trial court’s Order in order to expressly refer the case to the CIAC. Petitioner cannot proceed independently against FBI before a regular court in enforcing its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code. Petitioner has to sue respondents before the CIAC in order to be satisfied with the remaining balance it is due for services rendered, just as AEC has the right to present its claim before the CIAC against FBI for any remaining balance relative to their Construction Contract. Again, the CIAC has jurisdiction over all these claims due to the agreements of the parties and common jurisdictional sense.

WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit, and accordingly, the Decision dated March 15, 2019 and the Resolution dated January 15, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110751 are hereby AFFIRMED.
 
SO ORDERED.

Caguioa, (Chairperson), Inting, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.

Petitioner basically reiterates its argument that Article 1729 of the Civil Code gives it a right of action against respondents before the regular courts, despite the arbitration clauses in both the Construction Contract and the Subcontractor’s Agreement. Said Article 1729 of the Civil Code, to petitioner, is deemed written into the said agreements, and should prevail over the arbitration clauses in terms of vesting jurisdiction with the regular courts.
In its Comment/Opposition,[29] FBI cited the relatively recent case of Tourism Infrastructure & Enterprise Zone Authority v. Global-V Builders Co.,[30] which reiterated the Court’s ruling in Hutama-Rsea Joint Operations, Inc. v. Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corp.,[31] that the mere existence of an arbitration clause in a construction contract would already and automatically vest the CIAC with jurisdiction over the related dispute. FBI also asserts that relative to petitioner’s invocation of Article 1729 of the Civil Code, any of the farmer’s liability to the latter under said provision is still premised on the determination of any amount due AEC from FBI. This could only be determined in proper proceedings before the CIAC.

AEC’s right to file its comment was deemed waived by the Court in its Resolution dated March 29, 2023.","Respondents entered into a Construction Contract[7] notarized on July 8, 2015 (with Contract No. FBI-ICC-03) for the construction of the Integrated Coconut Products Processing Plant located in Barangay Darong, Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur. The terms of the said Construction Contract specified that FBI agreed to award the construction of the plant to AEC, an independent and legitimate job contractor, for the total contract price of P465 million. Article VIII[8] of the Construction Contract allowed AEC to assign any component of the scope of work to a subcontractor with FBI’s consent, whilst Article XVI[9] thereof had the following stipulation on dispute resolution:
In any event any dispute shall arise between the Parties with respect to any of the terms and conditions of the CONTRACT, the duly authorized representatives of the Parties shall meet as promptly as practicable after notice of such dispute to resolve in good faith such dispute.

Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising from or in relation to the CONTRACT shall first be settled amicably between the Parties, and if the Parties fail thereat, by arbitration in accordance with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. Arbitration Rules. The arbitration panel shall be composed of three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall designate an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators designated shall select a third arbitrator who will act as the presiding arbitrator. The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and executory unless properly set aside by a competent court on grounds allowed by law. The costs of arbitration shall be divided between the Parties. The arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in Makati City, Philippines, unless the nature of the hearing and the evidence sought to be presented will require the conduct of arbitral proceedings other than the aforesaid venue [sic].[10]

AEC did in fact subcontract to petitioner the provision of labor, materials, tools, equipment, technical supervision, testing, and commissioning of certain structural works on the plant through a Subcontractor’s Agreement[11] dated June 9, 2015.[12] The total contract price payable to petitioner for performance of the subcontracted services was P59,875,046.52, and critically, Item 29 of the Subcontractor’s Agreement stated the following:

29. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE. This Contract shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. If any disagreement or dispute arises between the parties, regarding the work subject matter of this sub-contract or from the interpretation of the contract and the documents appended thereto, and the parties are unable to resolve the disagreement between themselves, the same shall be submitted for arbitration by either party to the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission applying the Construction Industry Arbitration Law of the Philippines. The Arbitration process shall not constitute a reason for the SUB-CONTRACTOR to suspend construction of the work nor shall it affect the contract period/duration.[13]

In its Complaint filed before the trial court on April 25, 2017, petitioner alleged that the total revised contract price for the subcontracted services had ballooned to P97,843,917.00 (as of November 2016),[14] with AEC having only paid P44,975,009.30 as of October 3, 2016.[15] This supposedly left an unpaid balance of P53,206,359.76, exclusive of accompanying interest.[16] The Complaint indicates that petitioner sent its final demand to both Respondents on November 29, 2016.[17] Petitioner also apparently impleaded FBI pursuant to Article 1729 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 386, otherwise known as the “Civil Code of the Philippines,” viz.:

Article 1729. Those who put their labor upon or furnish materials for a piece of work undertaken by the contractor have an action against the owner up to the amount owing from the latter to the contractor at the time the claim is made. However, the following shall not prejudice the laborers, employees and furnishers of materials:

(1) Payments made by the owner to the contractor before they are due;

(2) Renunciation by the contractor of any amount due him from the owner.

This Article is subject to the provisions of special laws. (Emphasis, italics, and underscoring supplied)

FBI duly filed its Motion to Dismiss,[18] which outlined among other grounds the fact that jurisdiction over the case properly lied with the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. (PDRCI) in accordance with Article XVI of the Construction Contract. Moreover, FBI argued that petitioner failed to prove that the former did indeed owe a sum of money relative to the construction to AEC, which the latter asserts is a condition precedent for the applicability of Article 1729 of the Civil Code.

AEC also duly filed its Answer,[19] which asserted a cross-claim against FBI for the latter’s unpaid balance relative to the Construction Contract totaling P258,612,291.24,[20] and critically invoked Item 29 of its Subcontractor’s Agreement with petitioner for the dismissal of the latter’s Complaint. In effect, AEC invoked the primary, exclusive, and original jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC).","For the Court’s adjudication are the following two issues:
1)
Whether petitioner’s Complaint against AEC is subject to the CIAC jurisdiction; and
2)
Whether petitioner could validly implead FBI in the same complaint pursuant to Article 1729 of the Civil Code
At this stage, the Court deems it important to note that the propriety of the trial court’s dismissal of ABC’s cross-claim against FBI could no longer be raised as an issue, since AEC failed to file its comment. Moreover, said cross-claim is actually irrelevant to the instant petition and without prejudice to AEC’s participation in the CIAC arbitration proceedings, as will be discussed below.","In its Order dated December 13, 2017, the RTC dismissed both the Complaint and AEC’s cross-claim without prejudice, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Dismiss Cross Claim are hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, the instant case and the cross claim of defendant AEC are hereby DISMISSED without prejudice.

SO ORDERED.[21]

The trial court reasoned that both the Construction Contract between respondents and the Subcontractor’s Agreement between AEC and petitioner precluded the jurisdiction of the regular courts due to the primary jurisdiction of arbitral bodies duly stipulated by the parties. Said the trial court: “[t]he only sound conclusion is that as of this juncture, this Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim as well as the cross­claim. The parties must first undergo arbitration as agreed upon in their respective contracts.”[22]

Petitioner duly filed its Motion for Reconsideration,[23] invoking the lack of privity of contract it has vis-à-vis respondents’ Construction Contract, as well as the primacy of Article 1729 of the Civil Code over the Subcontractor’s Agreement. Simply put, petitioner asserted that even if the provisions of Item 29 of the Subcontractor’s Agreement are clear, petitioner could still sue respondents before the regular courts.

In its Order dated March 7, 2018, the trial court effectively denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration in the following manner:

WHEREFORE, considering that this Court has no jurisdiction over construction disputes, the parties are directed to initiate the proper arbitration proceedings before the CIAC to resolve their respective construction disputes.

In the meantime, the proceedings in the instant case are hereby suspended until the CIAC has made a final determination on the following construction disputes:

Liability, if any, of defendant AEC to the Plaintiff under their Sub-Contractor Agreement;
Liability, if any, of defendant AEC to defendant FBI under their Construction Contract; and/or
Liability, if any, of defendant FBI to defendant AEC under their Construction Contract.
SO ORDERED.[24]

Aggrieved, petitioner appealed the aforementioned Orders to the CA.

In its Decision dated March 15, 2019, the CA dismissed petitioner’s appeal, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISSED. The assailed Orders dated December 13, 2017 and March 7, 2018 issued by the RTC of Makati City, Branch 66 in Civil Case No. R-MKT-17-01339-CV are accordingly MODIFIED in that the RTC is directed to dismiss the case and refer the construction dispute/s among GDC, AEC and FBI to arbitration before the CIAC.

SO ORDERED.[25]

The appellate court basically reasoned that the arbitration clauses in both the Construction Contract between respondents and the Subcontractor’s Agreement between petitioner and AEC prevailed over the general provisions of Article 1729 of the Civil Code. Additionally, Rule 17.7 of A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC,[26] otherwise known as the “Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution” (ADR), authorizes a trial court to “issue an order directing the inclusion in arbitration of those parties who are bound by the arbitration agreement directly or by reference thereto.” Trial courts are further authorized by the said rule to dismiss cases and make referrals to the CIAC arbitration even if “[n]ot all of the parties to the civil action are bound by the arbitration agreement and referral to arbitration would result in multiplicity of suits.” Thus, the CA ruled that the RTC should have ordered the referral to the CIAC along with its dismissal of the case.

Petitioner duly filed its Motion for Reconsideration,[27] which insisted anew that Article 1729 of the Civil Code prevailed over the arbitration clauses, and that it had no privity of contract vis-à-vis respondents’ Construction Contract. Petitioner clarified that its action against respondents was simply a money claim cognizable before the regular courts, not a construction dispute cognizable before the CIAC.

In its Resolution dated January 15, 2020, the CA denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration in the following manner:

All told, the plaintiff-appellant GDC failed to convince Us to reconsider Our Decision dated March 15, 2019. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration dated April 16, 2019 filed by plaintiff-appellant is DENIED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.[28]

Hence, the instant petition.

The instant petition merits a denial.
Anent the first issue, there is neither doubt nor dispute that petitioner and AEC entered into their Subcontractor’s Agreement, which indeed contained an arbitration clause as embodied in the said Agreement’s Item 29. Section 4 of Executive Order No. (E.O.) 1008, which created the CIAC, provides the following:

Section 4. Jurisdiction. – The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.

The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include, but is not limited to, violations of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of the terms of agreement; interpretation and/or application of contractual time and delays; maintenance and defects; payment default of employer or contractor and changes in contract cost.

Excluded from the coverage of this law are disputes arising from employer-employee relationships, which shall continue to be covered by the Labor Code of the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)

Said requirement is also reflected in Rule 2, Section 2.3 of the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration, which mandates that “[f]or the CIAC to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must be bound by an arbitration agreement in their contract or subsequently agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.” There being a clear, unambiguous, valid, and subsisting stipulation for the CIAC arbitration here between petitioner and ABC, the trial court was thus correct and justified in dismissing the Complaint with respect to AEC and referring the same to the CIAC pursuant to Rule 17 of the Special Rules of Court on ADR.

The crux of the matter, however, lies in the Court’s resolution of the second issue, i.e., the correctness of the appellate court’s affirmation of the trial court’s interpretation of Article 1729 of the Civil Code – as juxtaposed with the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudential precedents on the CIAC jurisdiction. Verily, the question is put to bear: Was petitioner’s impleading of FBI in the Complaint below anchored on any legal basis?

Jurisprudence provides a guide as to the intent behind the said Civil Code provision. In Velasco v. Court of Appeals,[32] the Court said thus:

x x x The intention of the latter provision is to protect the laborers and the materialmen from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous contractors and from possible connivance between owners and contractors. Thus, a constructive vinculum or contractual privity is created by this provision, by way of exception to the principle underlying Article 1311[33] [of the Civil Code] between the owner, on the one hand, and those who furnish labor and/or materials, on the other.[34]

In JL Investment & Development, Inc. v. Tendon Philippines, Inc.,[35] the Court explained the direct and solidary liability created by Article 1729 of the Civil Code and imposed upon both the owner of a piece of work and the contractor in favor of a subcontractor who supplied materials and labor for the creation of the said piece of work, viz.:

This provision imposes a direct liability on an owner of a piece of work in favor of suppliers of materials (and laborers) hired by the contractor “up to the amount owing from the [owner] to the contractor at the time the claim is made.” Thus, to this extent, the owner’s liability is solidary with the contractor, if both are sued together. By creating a constructive vinculum between suppliers of materials (and laborers), on the one hand, and the owner of a piece of work, on the other hand, as an exception to the rule on privity of contracts, Article 1729 protects suppliers of materials (and laborers) from unscrupulous contractors and possible connivance between owners and contractors. As the Court of Appeals correctly ruled, the supplier’s cause of action under this provision, reckoned from the time of judicial or extra-judicial demand, subsists so long as any amount remains owing from the owner to the contractor. Only full payment of the agreed contract price serves as a defense against the supplier’s claim.[36] (Citations omitted)

Also, in Noell Whessoe, Inc. v. Independent Testing Consultants, Inc.,[37] the Court noted that the only defense that can defeat a claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code is when the subcontractor has already been fully paid for services rendered, to wit:

However, Article 1729, while serving as an exception to the general rule on the privity of contracts, likewise provides for an exception to this exception. The contractor is solidarily liable with the owner and subcontractor for any liabilities against a supplier despite the absence of contract between the contractor and supplier, except when the subcontractor has already been fully paid for its services.[38] (Italics in the original)

Applying the foregoing principle to the instant petition, FBI’s only defense would have been that it had already paid AEC in full under their Construction Contract. However, in its Motion to Dismiss, FBI asserted that the burden of proving said full payment fell on petitioner – an assertion to which the Court most assiduously disagrees.

Since Article 1729 of the Civil Code is in the nature of a solidary obligation, the defense of payment is actually a matter of evidence that rests on the debtor invoking it – not on the creditor filing a claim against a solidary obligor. In Bognot v. RRI Lending Corp.,[39] the Court held thus:

Jurisprudence tells us that one who pleads payment has the burden of proving it; the burden rests on the defendant to prove payment, rather than on the plaintiff to prove non-payment. Indeed, once the existence of an indebtedness is duly established by evidence, the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment rests on the debtor.[40]

At this point, the Court must emphasize that there is neither statutory nor jurisprudential basis for FBI’s assertion that there must first be a determination that it owes AEC any amount before petitioner could file its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code. Properly speaking, it is incumbent upon FBI to assert that it has no more amount due AEC as a defense – not the other way around, whereby petitioner is unduly burdened with proving the fact of said remaining balance precisely because it has no privity of contract relative to the agreement between FBI and AEC under their Construction Contract. Common sense and sound equity dictate that petitioner should not be made to prove FBI’s indebtedness to AEC, but instead that FBI be on guard in defending itself by positively asserting and proving that it had already paid AEC in full, or at least up to the amount that petitioner was due at the time of the filing of the Complaint. Otherwise, Article 1729 – as a veritable and equitable protection crafted precisely for entities like petitioner – would essentially become nothing more than hollow words and dead letter. Verily, interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat.

This brings up the next critical question: Was Article 1729 of the Civil Code effectively amended or repealed by the jurisdiction of the CIAC?

Although E.O. No. 1008 has a general boilerplate repealing clause (i.e., Section 23[41] thereof), there is no specific mention of either the Civil Code or Article 1729 thereof in the entire E.O. In Mecano v. Commission on Audit,[42] the Court discussed the nature of such general repealing provisions when it dealt with a conflict between the old and the new (and currently subsisting) Administrative Codes, viz.:

The question that should be asked is: What is the nature of this repealing clause? It is certainly not an express repealing clause because it fails to identify or designate the act or acts that are intended to be repealed. Rather, it is an example of a general repealing provision, as stated in Opinion No. 73, s. 1991. It is a clause which predicates the intended repeal under the condition that a substantial conflict must be found in existing and prior acts. The failure to add a specific repealing clause indicates that the intent was not to repeal any existing law, unless an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy exists in terms of the new and old laws.[43] (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)

The Court also expounded in the said case the doctrine of repeal by implication, to wit:

Repeal by implication proceeds on the premise that where a statute of later date clearly reveals an intention on the part of the legislature to abrogate a prior act on the subject, that intention must be given effect. Hence, before there can be a repeal, there must be a clear showing on the part of the lawmaker that the intent in enacting the new law was to abrogate the old one. The intention to repeal must be clear and manifest; otherwise, at least, as a general rule, the later act is to be construed as a continuation of, and not a substitute for, the first act and will continue so far as the two acts are the same from the time of the first enactment.

There are two categories of repeal by implication. The first is where provisions in the two acts on the same subject matter are in an irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one. The second is if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate to repeal the earlier law.

Implied repeal by irreconcilable inconsistency takes place when the two statutes cover the same subject matter; they are so clearly inconsistent and incompatible with each other that they cannot be reconciled or harmonized; and both cannot be given effect, that is, that one law cannot be enforced without nullifying the other.[44] (Citations omitted, emphasis and underscore supplied)

As for the doctrine of amendment by implication, the eminent commentator Ruben E. Agpalo (Agpalo) has consistently stated, thus:

An amendment by implication is neither presumed nor favored. On the contrary, every statute should be harmonized with other laws on the same subject, in the absence of a clear inconsistency between them. The legislative intent to amend a prior law on the same subject is usually shown by a statement in the later act that any provision of law which is inconsistent therewith is modified accordingly. The absence of such a provision in the statute does not, however, mean that the subsequent law may no longer operate to amend or modify a prior act on the same subject; it so operates as long as there is an irreconcilable repugnancy between them.

There is an implied amendment where a part of a prior statute embracing the same subject as the later act may not be enforced without nullifying the pertinent provision of the latter, in which event, the prior act is deemed amended or modified to the extent of the repugnancy.[45]

Indeed, Article 1729 of the Civil Code and Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008 both relate to actions and disputes relative to liabilities for unpaid services, materials, and labor in construction contracts. Thus, they are statutory provisions in pari materia. Agpalo elucidates thus on how to properly construe such statutory provisions, viz.:

The rule is that a statute should be so construed not only to be consistent with itself but also to harmonize with other laws on the same subject matter, as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system. The rule is expressed in the maxim, interpretare et concordare leges legibus est optimus interpretandi modus, or every statute must be so construed and harmonized with other statutes as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. Consistency in statutes as in executive issuances is of prime importance, and, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, all laws are presumed to be consistent with each other. Where it is possible to do so, it is the duty of courts, in the construction of statutes, to harmonize and reconcile them, and to adopt a construction of a statutory provision which harmonizes and reconciles it with other statutory provisions.

Stated differently, every statute should be construed in such a way that will harmonize it with existing laws. To interpret and to do it in such a way as to harmonize laws with laws is the best mode of interpretation.[46] (Citations omitted)

Agpalo goes on:

Statutes in pari materia should be construed together to attain the purpose of an express national policy. For the assumption is that whenever the legislature enacts a law, it has in mind the previous statutes relating to the same subject matter, and in the absence of any express repeal or amendment, the new statute is deemed enacted in accord with the legislative policy embodied in those prior statutes. Provisions in an act which are omitted in another act relative to the same subject matter will be applied in a proceeding under the other act, when not inconsistent with its purpose. Prior statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be compared with the new provisions, and if possible by reasonable construction, both to be construed that effect is given to every provision of each. Statutes in pari materia, although in apparent conflict, are as far as reasonably possible construed to be in harmony with each other. Similarly, every new statute should be construed in connection those already existing in relation to the same subject matter and all should be made to harmonize and stand together, if they can be done by any fair and reasonable interpretation. Interpretare et concordare leges legibus, est optimus interpretandi modus, which means that the best method of interpretation is that which makes laws consistent with other laws. Accordingly, courts of justice, when confronted with apparently conflicting statutes, should endeavor to reconcile them instead of declaring outright the invalidity of one against the other. Courts should harmonize them, if this is possible, because they are equally the handiwork of the same legislature.[47] (Citations omitted, emphases supplied)

Finally, and to belabor the point further, Agpalo combines the principles of construing statutes in pari materia with the doctrines of implied repeal and amendment, to wit:

In cases involving harmonization of two or more laws relating to the same subject matter, the usual question is whether the later act has impliedly amended or repealed the earlier statute. A statute will not, however, be construed as repealing [a] prior act or acts on the same subject in the absence of words to that effect, unless there is an irreconcilable repugnancy between them or unless the new law is evidently intended to supersede all prior acts on the matter and to comprise itself the sole and complete system of legislation on the subject. The rule in this connection is that in case of doubt, the doubt will be resolved against implied amendment or repeal and in favor of harmonization of all laws on the subject. And assuming that there is an implied amendment, the latter [sic] statute should be so construed as to modify the prior law on the subject no further than may be necessary to effect the specific purpose of the latter [sic] enactment.[48] (Citations omitted, emphases supplied)

Indeed, the Court sees no reason to conclude that it was the President’s intention in 1985, when he promulgated E.O. No. 1008, to do away with the statutory protection afforded to suppliers of labor and materials for a piece of work as embodied in Article 1729 of the Civil Code. In keeping with the aforementioned principles of statutory construction, the Court deems it proper to construe the provision on CIAC’s jurisdiction in harmony with Article 1729 of the Civil Code, since both provisions can indeed exist and operate in harmony together.

To operationalize this vis-à-vis the instant petition, the Court recognizes that indeed, petitioner has a valid right under Article 1729 of the Civil Code to proceed against both respondents for the satisfaction of AEC’s remaining liabilities under the Subcontractor’s Agreement. However, how petitioner may proceed with said claim must be seen to have been modified accordingly by the CIAC’s jurisdiction.

This is because petitioner, as subcontractor, is an assignee of the Construction Contract. Even if Article VIII of the Construction Contract between FBI and AEC necessitates the written consent of FBI (as owner) before any assignment of any component of the scope of works could be done by AEC, there is no allegation here of FBI’s lack of consent. Thus, FBI is deemed to have admitted to consenting to AEC’s subcontracting to petitioner. In relation to petitioner’s status as an assignee of the Construction Contract, the commentator Custodio O. Parlade notes the following in two of his seminal treatises, viz.:

The assignment of a construction contract containing an arbitration clause, executed by a contractor in favor of its subcontractor with the approval of the owner, had the effect of making the subcontractor the owner’s contractor, bound by the terms and conditions of the assigned contract. The construction contract contained an arbitration clause under which the owner agreed that disputes arising from the contract shall be submitted to arbitration. The arbitration agreement provided, however, that it shall [be] applicable to, and may be invoked only by, a foreign contractor, the original contractor being a foreign company. The Commission interpreted the assignment to be limited to the construction contract excluding its arbitration clause as the subcontractor was not a foreign company.[49] (Emphasis supplied)

The Court sees no reason why this interpretation should not be applied to the instant petition. ln fact, this would amply facilitate how petitioner could enforce its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code whilst keeping to the letter and spirit of the CIAC’s jurisdiction under E.O. No. 1008. Verily, this means that petitioner is effectively subrogated in AEC’s place to invoke the arbitration clause of the original Construction Contract. Even if the Construction Contract’s arbitration clause explicitly refers to PDRCI as the arbitral body, Rule 4, Section 4.1 of the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration is also explicit, viz.:

Section 4.1. Submission to CIAC jurisdiction. – An arbitration clause in a construction contract or a submission to arbitration of a construction dispute shall be deemed an agreement to submit an existing or future controversy to CIAC jurisdiction, notwithstanding the reference to a different arbitration institution or arbitral body in such contract or submission.[50]

Thus, petitioner effectively still had to invoke the CIAC’s jurisdiction relative to its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code. This is also in keeping with the maxim that any doubt should be resolved and liberally construed in favor of arbitration or arbitrability, as emphasized by the Court in LM Power Engineering Corp. v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc.[51] and Camp John Hay Development Corp. v. Charter Chemical & Coating Corp.[52] The Court also sees this as the wiser route for petitioner’s claims against respondents, since severing the claims from each other, i.e., with one being tried before a regular court and the other being adjudicated by the CIAC, would be an unduly burdensome instance of splitting causes of action. It would thus be better in the interest of justice for the CIAC to jointly rule on the solidary liabilities of both respondents, with the parties having every right to appeal the same.

In any case, the CIAC’s plenary jurisdiction over the construction dispute at bar prevails due to the fact that petitioner’s claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code against FBI arose in relation to, and ultimately on account of, the Subcontractor’s Agreement with AEC. Without said Subcontractor’s Agreement, petitioner would have no cause of action at all against FBI. The very terms of Item 29 of the Subcontractor’s Agreement are clear: “any dispute arising from the Subcontractor’s Agreement is first cognizable before the CIAC.” Thus, with the claim being one that emanates directly from a breach of the Subcontractor’s Agreement itself, the CIAC properly has primary, exclusive, and original jurisdiction over petitioner’s cause of action against FBI under Article 1729 of the Civil Code – even if, and especially because, petitioner has no privity of contract with FBI. Moreover, Section 35 of R.A. No. 9285, otherwise known as the “Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004,” provides for the plenary and all-encompassing coverage of construction industry-related disputes arising among parties such as project owners, contractors, and subcontractors, viz.:

Section 35. Coverage of the Law. – Construction disputes which fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (the “Commission”) shall include those between or among parties to, or who are otherwise bound by, an arbitration agreement, directly or by reference, whether such parties are project owner, contractor, subcontractor, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer of an insurance policy in a construction project.

The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is “commercial” pursuant to Section 21 of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)

Again, in order to harmonize this with Article 1729 of the Civil Code and Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008, the Court deems it wise to view this as a veritable jurisdictional “magnet” that pulls in even claims put forth by subcontractors against project owners – even if there be no contractual privity between them. As long as the project owner’s agreement with the contractor provides for (or leads to) the CIAC’s arbitral jurisdiction, and as long as the subcontractor’s agreement also provides for the same, the CIAC then has arbitral jurisdiction over claims made by the subcontractor against both the project owner and the contractor.

In effect, the trial court was thus correct in its dismissal of petitioner’s Complaint, and the appellate court was thus also correct in amending the dispositive portion of the trial court’s Order in order to expressly refer the case to the CIAC. Petitioner cannot proceed independently against FBI before a regular court in enforcing its claim under Article 1729 of the Civil Code. Petitioner has to sue respondents before the CIAC in order to be satisfied with the remaining balance it is due for services rendered, just as AEC has the right to present its claim before the CIAC against FBI for any remaining balance relative to their Construction Contract. Again, the CIAC has jurisdiction over all these claims due to the agreements of the parties and common jurisdictional sense.

WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit, and accordingly, the Decision dated March 15, 2019 and the Resolution dated January 15, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 110751 are hereby AFFIRMED.

THE COMMONER LENDING CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. RAFAEL BALANDRA, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



INTING, J.:
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] dated June 21, 2018, and the Resolution[3] dated April 16, 2019, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 05257. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision[4] dated March 25, 2013, of Branch 24, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Iloilo City, in Civil Case No. 23890 for Nullity of Documents and Damages.


The controversy pertains to an encumbrance of a parcel of land denominated as Lot 2-A, Psd-06-007963, located at Poblacion, Oton, Iloilo. The lot was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-126054[5] in the name of Spouses Rafael Balandra (respondent) and Alita Balandra (Alita). The lot and the house erected thereon (subject properties) were mortgaged to the Commoner Lending Corporation (petitioner) to secure a loan in the amount of P300,000.00 contracted by respondent’s wife, Alita.[6]
Invoking that the subject properties are his exclusive properties, respondent filed a Complaint for Nullity of Documents and Damages[7] on October 24, 1997 against petitioner and Alita. Respondent prayed for the nullification of the Real Estate Mortgage (REM) dated March 24, 1997 constituted on the subject properties.[8] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 23890 before the RTC.

Respondent alleged that Alita forged his signature on a document denominated as “General Power of Attorney”[9] (GPA) dated February 25, 1997, making it appear that he gave her authority, as his attorney-in-fact, to mortgage the subject properties. According to respondent, he could not have signed the document on February 25, 1997, because he was then out of the country on board an overseas vessel. Respondent, thus, prayed that the GPA dated February 25, 1997 and REM dated March 24, 1997 be declared null and void for lack of his consent to both documents.[10]

For its part, petitioner averred that it subjected Anita’s loan application to an extensive credit investigation, advising her of the need for a power of attorney from her husband, respondent. Upon being shown the questioned GPA and other documents petitioner approved the loan application on March 23, 1997. On March 24, 1997, petitioner released the amount of P300,000.00 allegedly to the spouses. On the same day, the REM was executed covering the subject lot and its improvements as security for the loan.[11]

According to petitioner, the spouses defaulted in their installment payments and had an outstanding obligation in the amount of P438,130.00 as of October 24, 1997. Respondent allegedly promised to pay 30% of the amount on or before October 15, 1997 and the remaining balance, thereafter, by way of installments.[12] Petitioner, thus, asserted that respondent ratified the questioned mortgage.[13]

Averring that respondent failed to comply with his undertaking to pay the outstanding obligation on the subject loan, petitioner extra-­judicially foreclosed the REM and consequently acquired the mortgaged properties.[14]



In its Decision[15] dated March 25, 2013, the RTC found respondent’s signature on the GPA dated February 25, 1997 a forgery. Characterizing the instrument as absolutely simulated or fictitious under Article 1409 of the Civil Code,[16] the RTC ruled that the partial payments made by respondent could not be considered as his ratification of or consent to the loan. For the RTC, respondent’s reason for attempting to settle the loan merely proceeded from his vain effort to save his house from execution.[17]
Nonetheless, finding the mortgaged properties as conjugal properties of the spouses, the RTC sustained the validity of the REM only as regards the one-half (1/2) portion of the mortgaged properties pertaining to the petitioner:

Wherefore, on the rule that the property subject of litigation is conjugal, what was validly mortgage[d] by the wife was one[-]half (1/2) of the property and one[-]half (1/2) should be considered still belonging to the [respondent] and the value of which shall be reimbursed by [petitioner] at the time of the taking, taken by way of writ of possession, and to pay the cost.

SO DECIDED.[18]

Both parties moved for reconsideration. For respondent, the REM is void, in its entirety, for being fictitious and simulated. On the other hand, petitioner protested the RTC’s partial nullification of the foreclosure, maintaining that respondent impliedly ratified the loan and the mortgage entered into by his wife when he made partial payments of the outstanding obligation on the loan. Petitioner further averred that the loan redounded to the benefit of respondent’s family.[19]

In an Order[20] dated July 19, 2013, the RTC denied both motion for reconsideration: (a) respondent failed to rebut the presumption that the subject properties belonged to the conjugal partnership of the spouses; while (b) petitioner failed to prove that the loan redounded to the benefit of the spouses’ family.[21]

The parties filed opposing appeals to the CA.


In the assailed Decision[22] dated June 21, 2018, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC Decision; thus:
WHEREFORE, the appeal of [respondent] Rafael Balandra is GRANTED, while the appeal of [petitioner] The Commoner Lending Corporation is DENIED.

The Decision dated March 25, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court, 6th Judicial Region, Branch 24, Iloilo City, in Civil Case No. 23890, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one is hereby rendered as follows:

The Real Estate Mortgage dated March 24, 1997 is declared NULL and VOID for want of consent on the part of [respondent] Rafael Balandra;
The foreclosure of the Real Estate Mortgage, and the certificate of sale issued pursuant thereto, are likewise declared NULL and VOID;
Accordingly, the Register of Deeds of Iloilo is hereby ORDERED to cancel the new Transfer Certificate of Title over the subject lot issued in the name of [petitioner] The Commoner Lending Corporation, and to reinstate Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-126054 in the name of the spouses Rafael Balandra and Alita M. Balandra; and
[Respondent] The Commoner Lending Corporation is hereby ORDERED to return the possession of the mortgaged properties back to the spouses Balandra.
SO ORDERED.[23] (Italics omitted)

The CA affirmed the findings of the RTC that respondent’s signature on the questioned GPA was a forgery and that the questioned loan did not redound to the benefit of the spouses’ family.[24]

Citing Article 124 of the Family Code,[25] the CA held that the REM is void in its entirety, and not merely voidable, for having been executed by Anita without respondent’s consent or authority. Characterizing the transaction as legally inexistent and absolutely wanting in civil effects, the CA ruled that the questioned REM cannot be cured or ratified even if respondent made partial payments on the loan it secured.[26]

Hence, the Petition assigning the following errors:

WHETHER OR NOT THE [CA] GRAVELY ERRED IN RULING THAT THE [GPA] IS FORGED;
WHETHER OR NOT THE [CA] GRAVELY FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE SUBSEQUENT PAYMENT BY THE RESPONDENT OF THE BALANCE OF THE LOAN RATIFIED THE MORTGAGE; [and]
WHETHER OR NOT THE [CA] ERRED IN RULING THAT THE [REM] DID NOT REDOUND TO THE BENEFIT OF THE FAMILY[.][27]


The resolution of the case hinges on the following: (a) the factual issue on the regularity in the execution of the questioned REM and (b) the substantive issue on the characterization of the REM constituted on the subject properties without the consent of respondent.


The petition is meritorious.
Factual question of forgery

Preliminarily, it is noted that the petition merely reiterates the factual issues and arguments relating to forgery which were squarely passed upon by the CA. The findings of the RTC, which were affirmed by the CA—i.e., physical impossibility of respondent to have signed the questioned REM and the discrepancies of respondent’s signatures as established by handwriting experts—are essentially factual inasmuch as the Court is being asked to revisit and re-evaluate the evidence on record and assess anew the testimonies given before the trial court. The questions of fact requiring a re-evaluation of evidence are inappropriate in a petition for review on certiorari filed with the Court.[28]

Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari and resolved by the Court. Not a trier of facts, the Court will not review the factual findings of the lower tribunals as these are generally binding and conclusive.[29] The rule applies with more reason in the case considering that the factual findings of the RTC were affirmed by the CA on appeal. While there are recognized exceptions to the rule,[30] none of them apply in the case. Accordingly, the Court sees no cogent reason to disturb the congruent findings of the RTC and the CA that respondent’s signature of the questioned REM is a forgery; thus:

First, the General Power of Attorney was examined by two (2) handwriting experts, namely: (1) Gregorio Mendoza, Jr., a Licensed Criminologist and the Dean of the School of Criminology of the Colegio de la Purisima Concepcion, Roxas City, who testified for [respondent]; and (2) P/Chief Inspector Arturo Bangcaya of the PNP Crime Laboratory of Region 6, who testified for [petitioner]. Despite being witnesses for the adverse parties, they both concluded that [respondent]’s standard signatures in his Passport and Seaman’s Book, on the one hand, differs from the questioned signature contained in the General Power of Attorney, on the other.

Second, a visual assessment by the Court of the questioned signature on the General Power of Attorney shows glaring dissimilarities with [respondent]’s standard signatures appearing in his Passport and Seaman’s Book.

Third, it is physically impossible for [respondent] to have signed the General Power of Attorney and to have appeared before the notary public on February 25, 1997 as he was then outside the Philippines and on board the vessel MV ANTJE as shown in his Passport and Seaman’s Book. Thus, the presumption of regularity in the execution of the General Power of Attorney was sufficiently debunked by [respondent]’s evidence.[31]

Characterization of an encumbrance of a conjugal property made by a spouse, without the written consent of the other.
 
The questioned REM dated March 24, 1997, which was executed on the basis of the forged GPA dated February 28, 1997, is governed by the Family Code which took effect on August 3, 1988.

In Alexander v. Spouses Escalona,[32] the Court held that the applicable law governing an alienation or encumbrance of conjugal properties, without the consent of the other spouse, must be reckoned on the date of the alienation or encumbrance. The Court laid the following guidelines:

1. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the wife’s consent, made before the effectivity of the Family Code, is not void but merely voidable. The applicable laws are Articles 166 and 173 of the Civil Code. The wife may file an action for annulment of contract within 10 years from the transaction; and

2. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse, made after the effectivity of the Family Code is void. The applicable law is Article 124 of the Family Code without prejudice to vested rights in the property acquired before August 3, 1988. Unless the transaction is accepted by the non-consenting spouse or is authorized by the court, an action for declaration of nullity of the contract may be filed before the continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person becomes ineffective.[33] (Underscoring supplied)

Article 116 of the Family Code provides that “[a]ll property acquired during the marriage, whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted or registered in the name of one or both spouses, is presumed to be conjugal unless the contrary is proved.” Here, the records are bereft of any strong, clear, and convincing evidence presented by respondent that the mortgaged properties were his exclusive properties. In his comment to the subject petition, respondent even admitted that the mortgaged properties are their conjugal properties.[34]

The Court has consistently held that a disposition or encumbrance of a conjugal property made by a spouse, without the written consent of the other, during the effectivity of the Family Code is void.[35] Article 124 thereof reads:

Article 124. The administration and enjoyment of the conjugal partnership property shall belong to both spouses jointly. In case of disagreement, the husband’s decision shall prevail, subject to recourse to the court by the wife for proper remedy, which must be availed of within five years from the date of the contract implementing such decision.

In the event that one spouse is incapacitated or otherwise unable to participate in the administration of the conjugal properties, the other spouse may assume sole powers of administration. These powers do not include disposition or encumbrance without authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse. In the absence of such authority or consent, the disposition or encumbrance shall be void. However, the transaction shall be construed as a continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person, and may be perfected as a binding contract upon the acceptance by the other spouse or authorization by the court before the offer is withdrawn by either or both offerors. (Italics and underscoring supplied)

The contemplated encumbrance or disposition, albeit categorized as a “void” transaction, is further characterized distinctly from void contracts under Article 1409 of the Civil Code that are deemed inexistent and, consequently, incapable of ratification.[36] Notably, void dispositions under Article 124 of the Family Code are expressly deemed as a continuing offer which may be perfected and accepted by consent of the previously non-consenting spouse.[37] In Spouses Cueno v. Spouses Bautista[38] the Court noted the special nature of the void transactions under the Family Code, i.e., they can become binding contracts upon the acceptance by the other spouse or authorization by the court before the continuing offers are withdrawn by either or both spouses.[39] In other words, a void contract under Article 124 of the Family, while not capable of ratification, is distinctively susceptible of perfection through acceptance by the non­consenting spouse.[40]

In the case, the REM executed by Alita without the written consent or authority of respondent partook of a continuing offer from petitioner and Alita that a mortgage be constituted over the subject conjugal properties to secure the questioned loan. Respondent had the option of accepting or rejecting the offer before its withdrawal either by petitioner or Alita. As found by both the RTC and CA, respondent, instead of rejecting the offer, undertook to pay the outstanding loan obligation and made partial payments thereon. The circumstances establish respondent’s acceptance of the offer, thereby perfecting the previously unauthorized REM into a binding undertaking on his part to constitute the mortgage over the subject conjugal properties as security for the loan.

It bears underscoring that respondent’s undertaking to settle the questioned loan, making partial payments thereon to prevent foreclosure, was relied upon by the petitioner. Pursuant to Article 1431 of the Civil Code,[41] a representation is rendered conclusive upon the party making it, and this representation cannot be denied as against the person relying thereon. That respondent’s undertaking to pay the loan proceeded from his vain effort to save the mortgaged properties from being foreclosed—is immaterial and irrelevant. There is nothing special or compelling about this reason as the foreclosure of a mortgage is a necessary consequence of the failure to settle the loan it secures.

In fine, the CA erred in holding that the questioned REM dated March 24, 1997 is legally inexistent and absolutely wanting in civil effects for lack of respondent’s consent. Pursuant to Article 124 of the Family Code, the previously unauthorized REM was perfected into a binding security for the questioned loan when respondent undertook to settle the loan, making partial payments thereon, to prevent foreclosure of the mortgage.

WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 21, 2018, and the Resolution dated April 16, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 05257 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Accordingly, respondent Rafael Balandra’s Complaint for Nullity of Documents and Damages in Civil Case No. 23890 is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

The applicable laws are Articles 166 and 173 of the Civil Code. The wife may file an action for annulment of contract within 10 years from the transaction; and

2. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse, made after the effectivity of the Family Code is void. The applicable law is Article 124 of the Family Code without prejudice to vested rights in the property acquired before August 3, 1988. Unless the transaction is accepted by the non-consenting spouse or is authorized by the court, an action for declaration of nullity of the contract may be filed before the continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person becomes ineffective.[33] (Underscoring supplied)

Article 116 of the Family Code provides that “[a]ll property acquired during the marriage, whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted or registered in the name of one or both spouses, is presumed to be conjugal unless the contrary is proved.” Here, the records are bereft of any strong, clear, and convincing evidence presented by respondent that the mortgaged properties were his exclusive properties. In his comment to the subject petition, respondent even admitted that the mortgaged properties are their conjugal properties.[34]

The Court has consistently held that a disposition or encumbrance of a conjugal property made by a spouse, without the written consent of the other, during the effectivity of the Family Code is void.[35] Article 124 thereof reads:

Article 124. The administration and enjoyment of the conjugal partnership property shall belong to both spouses jointly. In case of disagreement, the husband’s decision shall prevail, subject to recourse to the court by the wife for proper remedy, which must be availed of within five years from the date of the contract implementing such decision.

In the event that one spouse is incapacitated or otherwise unable to participate in the administration of the conjugal properties, the other spouse may assume sole powers of administration. These powers do not include disposition or encumbrance without authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse. In the absence of such authority or consent, the disposition or encumbrance shall be void. However, the transaction shall be construed as a continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person, and may be perfected as a binding contract upon the acceptance by the other spouse or authorization by the court before the offer is withdrawn by either or both offerors. (Italics and underscoring supplied)

The contemplated encumbrance or disposition, albeit categorized as a “void” transaction, is further characterized distinctly from void contracts under Article 1409 of the Civil Code that are deemed inexistent and, consequently, incapable of ratification.[36] Notably, void dispositions under Article 124 of the Family Code are expressly deemed as a continuing offer which may be perfected and accepted by consent of the previously non-consenting spouse.[37] In Spouses Cueno v. Spouses Bautista[38] the Court noted the special nature of the void transactions under the Family Code, i.e., they can become binding contracts upon the acceptance by the other spouse or authorization by the court before the continuing offers are withdrawn by either or both spouses.[39] In other words, a void contract under Article 124 of the Family, while not capable of ratification, is distinctively susceptible of perfection through acceptance by the non­consenting spouse.[40]

In the case, the REM executed by Alita without the written consent or authority of respondent partook of a continuing offer from petitioner and Alita that a mortgage be constituted over the subject conjugal properties to secure the questioned loan. Respondent had the option of accepting or rejecting the offer before its withdrawal either by petitioner or Alita. As found by both the RTC and CA, respondent, instead of rejecting the offer, undertook to pay the outstanding loan obligation and made partial payments thereon. The circumstances establish respondent’s acceptance of the offer, thereby perfecting the previously unauthorized REM into a binding undertaking on his part to constitute the mortgage over the subject conjugal properties as security for the loan.

It bears underscoring that respondent’s undertaking to settle the questioned loan, making partial payments thereon to prevent foreclosure, was relied upon by the petitioner. Pursuant to Article 1431 of the Civil Code,[41] a representation is rendered conclusive upon the party making it, and this representation cannot be denied as against the person relying thereon. That respondent’s undertaking to pay the loan proceeded from his vain effort to save the mortgaged properties from being foreclosed—is immaterial and irrelevant. There is nothing special or compelling about this reason as the foreclosure of a mortgage is a necessary consequence of the failure to settle the loan it secures.

In fine, the CA erred in holding that the questioned REM dated March 24, 1997 is legally inexistent and absolutely wanting in civil effects for lack of respondent’s consent. Pursuant to Article 124 of the Family Code, the previously unauthorized REM was perfected into a binding security for the questioned loan when respondent undertook to settle the loan, making partial payments thereon, to prevent foreclosure of the mortgage.

WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated June 21, 2018, and the Resolution dated April 16, 2019, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB-CV No. 05257 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

Accordingly, respondent Rafael Balandra’s Complaint for Nullity of Documents and Damages in Civil Case No. 23890 is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

SO ORDERED.

NORMA M. BALEARES AND HEIRS OF SANTOS BALEARES, PETITIONERS, VS. FELIPE B. ESPANTO, HEIRS OF ARNOLD V. MARANAN, REGISTER OF DEEDS MAKATI, AND CITY ASSESSOR OF MAKATI, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



INTING,** J.:
Before the Court is a Petition for Review[1] on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated December 21, 2018, and the Resolution[3] dated June 14, 2019, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 109382.
The assailed Decision and Resolution dismissed the appeal of Norma Baleares (Norma) and the Heirs of Santos Baleares (Santos) (collectively, petitioners) from the Orders dated April 25, 2017,[4] and June 19, 2017,[5] issued by Branch 138, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City in Civil Case No. 15-1229 for annulment of title and related documents and damages.[6]



Petitioners—the widow and the heirs of Santos—are the occupants and possessors of a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. RT-57 (9482)[7] (subject property) registered in the name of Santos, his siblings[8] and his nephew[9] as co-owners. Sometime in 1988, the Baleares siblings mortgaged the subject property to Arnold V. Maranan (Arnold).[10] On February 19, 1988, the mortgage was registered and annotated as Entry No. 47847[11] on the title to the property.[12]

On June 17, 1998, petitioners filed a Complaint[13] with the RTC of Makati City for cancellation of Entry No. 47847 on TCT No. RT-57 (9482) grounded on Arnolds’s failure to enforce his mortgage right over the subject property within the 10-year prescriptive period; the case was raffled to Branch 134 and docketed as Civil Case No. 98-1360.[14]

In the meantime, Arnold was able to foreclose on the mortgage and, as the highest bidder in the public auction, was issued a Certificate of Sale dated March 2, 1999.[15]

Sometime in April 2000, Felipe B. Espanto (Felipe) and his mother Margarita Espanto (Margarita) – sister of Santos, also filed a Complaint[16] against Arnold for nullification of the mortgage and/or foreclosure likewise premised on prescription of the latter’s mortgage right; the case was filed before Branch 135, RTC, Makati City and docketed as Civil Case No. 00-523. Purportedly, Felipe and Margarita, in their own right, were also claiming to be co-owners of the subject property.

On July 18, 2003, the RTC rendered a judgment ordering the cancellation of Entry No. 47847 annotated on TCT No. RT-57 (9482) on the ground that Arnold’s right to foreclose the mortgage had already prescribed.[17] It also declared void Arnold’s extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage and the auction sale for noncompliance with the requirements of notice and publication required under Act No. 3135,[18] as amended.[19] The Decision of the RTC was affirmed by the CA[20] and became final and executory on February 1, 2008.[21]

On September 9, 2008, Arnold was able to consolidate the title over the subject property. TCT No. RT-57 (9482) was cancelled and in lieu thereof, TCT No. 225363[22] was issued in his name. Subsequently, Arnold sold the subject property to Felipe.[23] As a consequence, TCT No. 225363 was cancelled and TCT No. 225428[24] was issued in the name of Felipe on September 25, 2008.[25]

On August 17, 2009, Felipe, as the new registered owner of the subject property, initiated an action[26] for ejectment against petitioners before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati City; the case was docketed as Civil Case No. 98995 (Espanto’s ejectment suit).

On May 10, 2012, pending proceedings in the ejectment suit before the MeTC, petitioners filed an Amended Complaint.[27] for the nullification of Arnold’s extra-judicial foreclosure sale and all subsequent acts executed relative thereto including the cancellation of TCT No. 225428 in Felipe’s name. The case was raffled to Branch 58 of the RTC of Makati City (RTC-Br. 58) and was docketed as Civil Case No. 09-746 (the First Case). The RTC, however, dismissed the First Case on October 22, 2013, for failure of petitioners and their counsel to appear during the mandatory pre-trial conference (First Dismissal Order).[28] Petitioners failed to appeal the order of dismissal.[29]

On August 11, 2014, the MeTC granted Felipe’s ejectment suit and ordered petitioners to vacate the premises.[30] The Decision of the MeTC was affirmed in toto by the RTC[31] and the CA.[32] In a petition for review on certiorari subsequently interposed by petitioners, the Court reversed the CA’s Decision and accordingly dismissed[33] Felipe’s ejectment suit. The Court ruled against Felipe’s better right to possess the subject property as against that of petitioners; at the time Felipe bought the property from Arnold, he was well aware that TCT No. 225363 in the name of Arnold was void and inexistent in view of the final and executory Decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. 98-1360 which established that the mortgage right of Arnold inscribed in TCT No. RT-57 (9482) as Entry No. 47847 had already prescribed and could no longer be enforced.

On October 29, 2015, shortly after the RTC rendered judgment affirming the Decision of the MeTC in Felipe’s ejectment suit, petitioners filed before Branch 138, RTC, Makati City (RTC-Br. 138) the present Complaint[34] for Annulment of Title and Related Documents and Damages against Arnold and Felipe, the Register of Deeds of Makati, and the City Assessor of Makati; petitioners sought the annulment of TCT Nos. 225363 and 225428 and the corollary reinstatement of TCT No. RT-57 (9482).[35] The Complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 15-1229 (the Present Case).

On September 8, 2016 petitioners amended their complaint in the Present Case to implead the heirs of Arnold.[36] Meanwhile, instead of filing an Answer, Felipe filed a Motion to Dismiss[37] on the ground of res judicata.



On April 25, 2017, the RTC-Br. 138 issued an Order[38] (the Second Dismissal Order) dismissing the Present Case on the ground that its filing was barred by a previous judgment of dismissal in the First Case which involved the same causes of action in the Present Case.[39] The RTC denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration in an Order[40] dated June 19, 2017.

Petitioners filed before the CA an appeal[41] docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 109382. They assailed both orders of the RTC dismissing the Present Case and denying their motion for reconsideration.[42]



In its Decision[43] dated December 21, 2018, the CA dismissed the appeal. It held that the issues posed by petitioners involved pure questions of law that should have been raised via a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court before the Court.[44] Petitioners sought reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion in its Resolution[45] dated June 14, 2019.



Petitioners are now before the Court proffering as grounds the following:

The Hon. Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the PETITIONERS’ Appeal filed therewith on the ground of being improper.
Under the peculiar facts and circumstances obtaining in the case at bar, Civil Case No. 15-1229 is not barred by the prior dismissal of Civil Case No. 09-746.[46]


The pivotal issues for resolution before the Court are the following: (1) whether the CA erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction; (2) whether the filing of the Present Case is barred by the prior dismissal of the First Case; and (3) whether the petition should be given due course.



While the CA’s dismissal of petitioner’s appeal is justified under the factual milieu of the case, the Court is disposed to grant the petition in the greater interest of substantial justice.

The petition in the CA raised pure questions of law.
Pursuant to Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, the CA did not err in outrightly dismissing petitioners’ appeal. The Court in Park Developers, Inc. v. Daclan[47] held that:

Under the Rules of Court, there are two modes of appeal from a decision or final order of the trial court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction: (1) by writ of error under Section 2(a), Rule 41 if questions of fact or questions of fact and law are raised or involved; or (2) appeal by certiorari under Section 2(c), Rule 41, in relation to Rule 45, where only questions of law are raised or involved. This is glaringly clear from the provisions of Section 2, Rule 41, viz.:

Sec. 2. Modes of appeal. –
(a)
Ordinary appeal. – The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. x x x.
 
x x x x
          
(c)
Appeal by certiorari. – In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with Rule 45.
Thus, this Court finds that the CA did not err in dismissing petitioners’ appeal. Since what petitioners raised in their appeal was a pure question of law, their proper recourse was to file before this Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. In fact, the CA’s dismissal of petitioners’ appeal was the only proper and unavoidable outcome as Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court provides:

Sec. 2. Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals. – An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court. Similarly, an appeal by notice of appeal instead of by petition for review from the appellate judgment of a Regional Trial Court shall be dismissed.

An appeal erroneously taken to the Court of Appeals shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright.[48] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

“A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.”[49]

Irrefutably, the issue in the appeal below concerns only a question of law. In its April 25, 2017 Order[50] dismissing the Present Case on the ground of res judicata, the RTC did not make any findings of fact but merely applied various provisions under the Rules of Court.[51] As correctly ruled by the CA, the question of whether or not res judicata serves as a bar to the filing of a case is unquestionably one of law.[52] The CA thus did not err when it dismissed petitioners’ appeal outright. The Rules of Court, using mandatory language, clearly and unequivocally establish the rule that an appeal raising pure questions of law and erroneously taken to the CA “shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright.”[53]

Despite the absence of error on the part of the CA in dismissing petitioners’ appeal for being the wrong mode, the Court finds it imperative nonetheless to write finis to the issue at fore – the propriety of the dismissal of the Present Case by the RTC-Br. 138 on the ground of res judicata.

The filing of the Present Case should not be construed as barred by res judicata.
The focal issue in the present recourse centers on the effect of the First Dismissal Order issued by the RTC-Br. 138 on the continuance of the proceedings in the Present Case – whether it operated as res judicata warranting the dismissal of the Present Case.

Res judicata in its concept as “bar by prior judgment” under Section 47(b)[54] of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court requires the concurrence of the following requisites: “(1) the former judgment is final; (2) it is rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it is a judgment or an order on the merits; and (4) there is, between the first and the second actions, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.”[55]

Anent the first, second, and fourth requisites, the parties do not dispute the fact that RTC-Br. 58 has jurisdiction over the First Case, and the First Dismissal Order has long become final and executory for petitioners’ failure to appeal it. There is also, between the First Case and the Present Case, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action, viz.: the parties in the Present Case are the same parties in the First Case;[56] the real property formerly covered by TCT No. RT-57 (9482) is also the same property subject of the controversy in both cases;[57] and the causes of action in the two cases are also the same—that is, the declaration of nullity of the deed of sale between Arnold and Felipe covering the subject property, the consequent annulment of TCT Nos. 225363 and 225428 respectively issued in the names of Arnold and Felipe, and the claim for damages.[58]

With the peculiar factual circumstances obtaining in the case, however, the Court resolves that the First Dismissal Order, which respondents claim constitute a bar to the filing of the Present Case, does not comply with the third requisite above – that the order must be on the merits.

In dismissing the Present Case, the RTC-Br. 138 subscribed to the contention of respondents that the cause of action in the Present Case was barred by the First Dismissal Order for failure of the petitioners and their counsel to appear during the scheduled pre-trial hearing dates in the First Case. The RTC-Br. 138 ruled that the dismissal, which was a dismissal with prejudice, amounted to an adjudication on the merits of the case in consonance with Sections 4[59] and 5,[60] Rule 18 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (the Rules).

In the present recourse, petitioners aver that the First Dismissal Order should be deemed to be one without prejudice and should not be considered as an adjudication on the merits because they were deprived of their family home without due process of law.[61] Petitioners assert that their failure to attend the mandatory pre-trial hearing was due to the gross and palpable negligence amounting to bad faith on the part of their counsel therein, who failed to attend the pre-trial hearings and notify them of the hearings despite due notice from the court; neither did their counsel inform them of the First Dismissal Order nor appeal therefrom.[62] They plead that they should not be bound by the gross negligence of their counsel who practically abandoned their case. Petitioners, therefore, pray that the Rules of Court be liberally interpreted in their favor; that their instant petition for review be given due course as to allow them an opportunity to defend and protect their property through a full-blown trial on the merits rather than lose their home to technicalities.

Petitioners’ supplication holds water and is worthy of solace. Considering the factual milieu of the case, it behooves the Court to negate the application of res judicata on the ground that the First Dismissal Order did not operate as an adjudication on the merits or determination of the rights of the parties in the First Case. The First Case was dismissed by the RTC-Br. 58 not on the merits but on a technicality – that is, the failure of the petitioners and their counsel to attend the pre-trial hearing.

While it has been settled that the consequence of the plaintiff’s non-appearance in the pre-trial is the dismissal of the case with prejudice,[63] the Court deems the dismissal with prejudice as harsh considering respondents’ apparent lack of legal title to the subject property and their patent indefensible attempt to obtain, in utter bad faith, registration of the title to the subject property in their names.

From the allegations in petitioners’ complaint in the First Case, it bears to note that after petitioners learned of the mortgage of the subject property to Arnold, they immediately filed Civil Case No. 98-1360 for the cancellation of the mortgage entry in the title to the subject property. The RTC in said case nullified Arnold’s extrajudicial foreclosure on the ground of prescription and for noncompliance with the requirements of notice and publication under Act No. 3135; the Decision was affirmed by the CA and became final and executory for Arnold’s failure to appeal it. Despite the final and immutable judgment declaring the foreclosure void, Arnold, as the buyer of the subject property at the auction sale, caused the issuance in his name of TCT No. 225363 on September 9, 2008. Eight days later, Arnold sold the property to Felipe, who was well aware of Arnold’s lack of legal title. In fact, the records show that, in a separate complaint filed by Felipe and his mother, they claimed to be owners of the subject property in their own right and questioned Felipe’s title thereto likewise subscribing to petitioners’ position in Civil Case No. 98-1360 that Arnold’s mortgage right had already prescribed.

Against this background, the Court deems that the First Dismissal Order did not effectively amount to a prior judgment which would bar the re-litigation of petitioners’ causes of action in the Present Case in view of the fact that petitioners were deprived of the opportunity to be heard on their cause of action. As it should have been, the said dismissal should be construed as without prejudice for violating petitioners’ right to due process if only to grant them the opportunity to refile the case to ventilate their cause of action. Stated thus, the First Dismissal Order did not substantially amount to res judicata which would warrant the dismissal of the Present Case.

The doctrine of res judicata is a rule of justice and cannot be rigidly applied where it will result in injustice.[64] As aptly held by the Court in Salud v. Court of Appeals,[65]

There is universal agreement on the principles underlying res judicata, viz.:

“x x x Two maxims of the English common law best summarize the general policies underlying this doctrine. They are: first, that no person should be twice vexed by the same claim; and second, that it is in the interest of the state that there be an end to litigation. Thus, principles of res judicata serve both private and public interests.

The interest of the judicial system in preventing relitigation of the same dispute recognizes that judicial resources are finite and the number of cases that can be heard by the court is limited. Every dispute that is reheard means that another will be delayed. In modem times when court dockets are filled to overflowing, this concern is of critical importance. Res judicata thus conserves scarce judicial resources and promotes efficiency in the interest of the public at large.

Once a final judgment has been rendered, the prevailing party also has an interest in the stability of that judgment. Parties come to the courts in order to resolve controversies; a judgment would be of little use in resolving disputes if the parties were free to ignore it and to litigate the same claims again and again. Although judicial determinations are not infallible, judicial error should be corrected through appeals procedures, not through repeated suits on the same claim. Further, to allow relitigation creates the risk of inconsistent results and presents the embarrassing problem of determining which of two conflicting decisions is to be preferred. Since there is no reason to suppose that the second or third determination of a claim necessarily is more accurate than the first, the first should be left undisturbed.

In some cases the public at large also has an interest in seeing that rights and liabilities once established remain fixed. If a court quiets title to land, for example, everyone should be able to rely on the finality of that determination. Otherwise, many business transactions would be clouded by uncertainty. Thus, the most important purpose of res judicata is to provide repose for both the party litigants and the public. As the Supreme Court has observed, ‘res judicata thus encourages reliance on judicial decision, bars vexatious litigation, and frees the courts to resolve other disputes.”‘

In our age, where courts are harassed by crowded dockets and complaints against slow foot justice, frequent technical reliance on the preclusive breadth of res judicata is understandable. The importance of judicial economy and avoidance of repetitive suits are strong norms i[n] a society in need of swift justice. Be that as it may, there should not be a mechanical and uncaring reliance on res judicata where more important societal values deserve protection. So we held in Suarez vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,

Assuming in gratia argumenti that the prior judgment of dismissal with prejudice was validly rendered within the lawful discretion of the court and could be considered as an adjudication on the merits, nonetheless, the principle of res judicata should be disregarded if its application would involve the sacrifice of justice to technicality x x x. The application of the said principle, under the particular facts obtaining, would amount to denial of justice and/or bar to a vindication of a legitimate grievance x x x.

The case at bench presents an exceptional instance where an inflexible application of the doctrine of res judicata will not serve our constitutional policy favoring fairness, the heart of due process. x x x.

x x x. The demands of due process present a weightier consideration than the need to bring an end to the parties’ litigation. For more important than the need to write finis to litigation is to finish it justly, and there can be no justice that satisfies unless the litigants are given the opportunity to be heard. x x x.[66] (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)

Petitioners’ case merits the relaxation of procedural rules.
Given the circumstances, the Court cannot but spare a thought for the desperate plight of petitioners who stand to lose their home to a technicality and to respondents’ elusive schemes. Respondents’ repulsive disregard of a final and executory decision and their unscrupulous manipulation of the technical rules of procedure to suit their ignoble ends demonstrates a flagrant denigration of justice.

Substantial justice begs that the merits of petitioners’ cause be passed upon considering that no prejudice will result to Felipe who does not stand to lose the subject property over which he never had title in the first instance. If petitioners’ allegations in their complaint are established during the trial, Arnold and Felipe will have no right to claim a better title to the subject property as against petitioners. Besides, because the registration of respondents’ titles was done in bad faith, it is as if there was no registration at all.[67] Registration does not vest title; it is merely the evidence of such title for our land registration laws do not give the holder any better title than what he actually has.[68]

The Court applauds the zealousness of the RTC-Br. 138 in upholding the Rules and in consequently dismissing the Present Case on the ground of res judicata; however, the application of this principle cannot be made the basis to deny petitioners the opportunity to a fair trial to prove their claim as against respondents.

Indeed, while procedural rules “are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party’s substantive rights,”[69] the Court has nonetheless been consistent in its rulings that the law abhors the technicalities that impede the cause of action.[70] If the application of the Rules would tend to frustrate rather than promote justice, it is always within our power to suspend the Rules, or except a particular case from its operation.[71] Thus, in Commissioner of Customs v. PTT Philippines Trading Corp.,[72] the Court held that:

Rules of Procedure should not be rigidly applied if it will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice. Depending on the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.[73]

In Heirs of Lagon v. Ultramax Healthcare Supplies, Inc.,[74] the Court emphasized that rules of procedure are not so rigid as to frustrate the full adjudication of cases:

x x x. Procedural rules are designed to aid the courts in resolving cases. They neither create nor take away vested rights, but merely facilitate the trial court’s reception and evaluation of all evidence given the facts and circumstances presented by the parties. They give litigants the opportunity to establish the merits of their complaint or defense rather than lose life, liberty, or property on mere technicalities. This Court should not demand a strict application of these rules when such would exacerbate the situation rather than promote substantial justice.[75] (Citations omitted)

From a consideration of the events that transpired in the case, the Court finds good reason to support petitioners’ assertion that the First Dismissal Order should not be construed as tantamount to an adjudication on the merits considering that, on top of respondents’ wily scheme to mask their lack of legal title over the subject property, petitioners were denied their right to present their case ostensibly due to the gross negligence of their counsel whose failure to apprise them of the developments in the case eventually led to the dismissal of the First Case to the extreme prejudice and damage of the petitioners. This being so, said dismissal cannot be the basis of res judicata; it cannot be a bar to a lawful claim. If at all, the first dismissal order may be considered as one without prejudice.[76]

While as a general rule the negligence of the counsel binds the client, one of the exceptions is when the counsel’s actuations are gross or palpable, resulting in serious injustice to the client.[77] A lawyer is deemed to be grossly negligent when he or she fails to exercise even the slightest degree of care or diligence, or entirely omits the same. Gross negligence examines a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them.[78]

As borne by the records, the RTC-Br. 58 finally dismissed[79] the First Case after both petitioners and their counsel failed to attend the pre-trial hearing dates set by the trial court four times despite due notice. Petitioners’ counsel explicated that while the notices were received by his office staff, they were misplaced and he was not informed about them. In its Order[80] dated May 2, 2014, the RTC-Br. 58 admonished petitioners’ counsel for his apparent neglect in keeping an orderly system for the receipt of judicial notices, but nonetheless denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration of the First Dismissal Order.

Indeed, a lawyer owes it to himself or herself and to his or her clients to adopt an efficient and orderly system of receiving and attending promptly to all judicial notices lest he or she and his or her clients suffer the consequences of one’s failure to do so.

However, when the incompetence, ignorance or inexperience of counsel is so great and the result is so serious that the client, who otherwise has a good cause, is prejudiced and denied his or her day in court, the client deserves another chance to present his or her case.[81] Apparently, petitioners were prevented from fully and fairly presenting their First Case and ran the risk of losing their home because of the professional delinquency or infidelity of their counsel. Moreover, where a case was not tried on the merits and was dismissed due to the negligence of counsel rather than the plaintiff, in the interest of justice, the dismissal of the case should be decreed to be without prejudice to the filing of a new action;[82] thus, negating the applicability of res judicata.

The Court cannot hold to technicalities at the expense of frustrating substantive rights. The resolve to reinstate the instant complaint and allow petitioners the opportunity to present their case in court will be more in accord with the Court’s duty to effectively dispense justice. The Court accedes to petitioners’ asseveration that their case falls under the exception to the rule that the negligence of counsel binds the client. In Tamboa v. People,[83] the Court ruled:

x x x. What should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on technicalities. Corollarily, the rule, which states that the mistakes of counsel bind the client, may not be strictly followed where observance of it would result in the outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property, or where the interest of justice so requires.[84]

The Court reiterates that it is the avowed policy of the law to accord both parties every opportunity to pursue and defend their cases in the open and relegate technicality to the background in the interest of substantial justice.[85] Respondents herein cannot be allowed to engage in a game of technicalities as a convenient subterfuge for causes which are unjustified and fraudulent; lest the Court tolerate the prostitution of the rules of procedure to breed injustice.

WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing pronouncements, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated December 21, 2018 and the Resolution dated June 14, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 109382 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

The Order dated April 25, 2017 and the Order dated June 19, 2017 of Branch 138, Regional Trial Court, Makati City in Civil Case No. 15-1229 dismissing the complaint for annulment of title and related documents and damages of Norma Baleares and the Heirs of Santos Baleares are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In the interest of substantial justice, the instant case is hereby REMANDED to Branch 138, Regional Trial Court, Makati City for trial on the merits.

","Petitioners—the widow and the heirs of Santos—are the occupants and possessors of a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. RT-57 (9482)[7] (subject property) registered in the name of Santos, his siblings[8] and his nephew[9] as co-owners. Sometime in 1988, the Baleares siblings mortgaged the subject property to Arnold V. Maranan (Arnold).[10] On February 19, 1988, the mortgage was registered and annotated as Entry No. 47847[11] on the title to the property.[12]

On June 17, 1998, petitioners filed a Complaint[13] with the RTC of Makati City for cancellation of Entry No. 47847 on TCT No. RT-57 (9482) grounded on Arnolds’s failure to enforce his mortgage right over the subject property within the 10-year prescriptive period; the case was raffled to Branch 134 and docketed as Civil Case No. 98-1360.[14]

In the meantime, Arnold was able to foreclose on the mortgage and, as the highest bidder in the public auction, was issued a Certificate of Sale dated March 2, 1999.[15]

Sometime in April 2000, Felipe B. Espanto (Felipe) and his mother Margarita Espanto (Margarita) – sister of Santos, also filed a Complaint[16] against Arnold for nullification of the mortgage and/or foreclosure likewise premised on prescription of the latter’s mortgage right; the case was filed before Branch 135, RTC, Makati City and docketed as Civil Case No. 00-523. Purportedly, Felipe and Margarita, in their own right, were also claiming to be co-owners of the subject property.

On July 18, 2003, the RTC rendered a judgment ordering the cancellation of Entry No. 47847 annotated on TCT No. RT-57 (9482) on the ground that Arnold’s right to foreclose the mortgage had already prescribed.[17] It also declared void Arnold’s extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage and the auction sale for noncompliance with the requirements of notice and publication required under Act No. 3135,[18] as amended.[19] The Decision of the RTC was affirmed by the CA[20] and became final and executory on February 1, 2008.[21]

On September 9, 2008, Arnold was able to consolidate the title over the subject property. TCT No. RT-57 (9482) was cancelled and in lieu thereof, TCT No. 225363[22] was issued in his name. Subsequently, Arnold sold the subject property to Felipe.[23] As a consequence, TCT No. 225363 was cancelled and TCT No. 225428[24] was issued in the name of Felipe on September 25, 2008.[25]

On August 17, 2009, Felipe, as the new registered owner of the subject property, initiated an action[26] for ejectment against petitioners before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati City; the case was docketed as Civil Case No. 98995 (Espanto’s ejectment suit).

On May 10, 2012, pending proceedings in the ejectment suit before the MeTC, petitioners filed an Amended Complaint.[27] for the nullification of Arnold’s extra-judicial foreclosure sale and all subsequent acts executed relative thereto including the cancellation of TCT No. 225428 in Felipe’s name. The case was raffled to Branch 58 of the RTC of Makati City (RTC-Br. 58) and was docketed as Civil Case No. 09-746 (the First Case). The RTC, however, dismissed the First Case on October 22, 2013, for failure of petitioners and their counsel to appear during the mandatory pre-trial conference (First Dismissal Order).[28] Petitioners failed to appeal the order of dismissal.[29]

On August 11, 2014, the MeTC granted Felipe’s ejectment suit and ordered petitioners to vacate the premises.[30] The Decision of the MeTC was affirmed in toto by the RTC[31] and the CA.[32] In a petition for review on certiorari subsequently interposed by petitioners, the Court reversed the CA’s Decision and accordingly dismissed[33] Felipe’s ejectment suit. The Court ruled against Felipe’s better right to possess the subject property as against that of petitioners; at the time Felipe bought the property from Arnold, he was well aware that TCT No. 225363 in the name of Arnold was void and inexistent in view of the final and executory Decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. 98-1360 which established that the mortgage right of Arnold inscribed in TCT No. RT-57 (9482) as Entry No. 47847 had already prescribed and could no longer be enforced.

On October 29, 2015, shortly after the RTC rendered judgment affirming the Decision of the MeTC in Felipe’s ejectment suit, petitioners filed before Branch 138, RTC, Makati City (RTC-Br. 138) the present Complaint[34] for Annulment of Title and Related Documents and Damages against Arnold and Felipe, the Register of Deeds of Makati, and the City Assessor of Makati; petitioners sought the annulment of TCT Nos. 225363 and 225428 and the corollary reinstatement of TCT No. RT-57 (9482).[35] The Complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 15-1229 (the Present Case).

On September 8, 2016 petitioners amended their complaint in the Present Case to implead the heirs of Arnold.[36] Meanwhile, instead of filing an Answer, Felipe filed a Motion to Dismiss[37] on the ground of res judicata.",The pivotal issues for resolution before the Court are the following: (1) whether the CA erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction; (2) whether the filing of the Present Case is barred by the prior dismissal of the First Case; and (3) whether the petition should be given due course.,"On April 25, 2017, the RTC-Br. 138 issued an Order[38] (the Second Dismissal Order) dismissing the Present Case on the ground that its filing was barred by a previous judgment of dismissal in the First Case which involved the same causes of action in the Present Case.[39] The RTC denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration in an Order[40] dated June 19, 2017.

Petitioners filed before the CA an appeal[41] docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 109382. They assailed both orders of the RTC dismissing the Present Case and denying their motion for reconsideration.[42]

In its Decision[43] dated December 21, 2018, the CA dismissed the appeal. It held that the issues posed by petitioners involved pure questions of law that should have been raised via a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court before the Court.[44] Petitioners sought reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion in its Resolution[45] dated June 14, 2019.

While the CA’s dismissal of petitioner’s appeal is justified under the factual milieu of the case, the Court is disposed to grant the petition in the greater interest of substantial justice.

The petition in the CA raised pure questions of law.
Pursuant to Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, the CA did not err in outrightly dismissing petitioners’ appeal. The Court in Park Developers, Inc. v. Daclan[47] held that:

Under the Rules of Court, there are two modes of appeal from a decision or final order of the trial court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction: (1) by writ of error under Section 2(a), Rule 41 if questions of fact or questions of fact and law are raised or involved; or (2) appeal by certiorari under Section 2(c), Rule 41, in relation to Rule 45, where only questions of law are raised or involved. This is glaringly clear from the provisions of Section 2, Rule 41, viz.:

Sec. 2. Modes of appeal. –
(a)
Ordinary appeal. – The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. x x x.
 
x x x x
 	 
(c)
Appeal by certiorari. – In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with Rule 45.
Thus, this Court finds that the CA did not err in dismissing petitioners’ appeal. Since what petitioners raised in their appeal was a pure question of law, their proper recourse was to file before this Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. In fact, the CA’s dismissal of petitioners’ appeal was the only proper and unavoidable outcome as Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court provides:

Sec. 2. Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals. – An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court. Similarly, an appeal by notice of appeal instead of by petition for review from the appellate judgment of a Regional Trial Court shall be dismissed.

An appeal erroneously taken to the Court of Appeals shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright.[48] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

“A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.”[49]

Irrefutably, the issue in the appeal below concerns only a question of law. In its April 25, 2017 Order[50] dismissing the Present Case on the ground of res judicata, the RTC did not make any findings of fact but merely applied various provisions under the Rules of Court.[51] As correctly ruled by the CA, the question of whether or not res judicata serves as a bar to the filing of a case is unquestionably one of law.[52] The CA thus did not err when it dismissed petitioners’ appeal outright. The Rules of Court, using mandatory language, clearly and unequivocally establish the rule that an appeal raising pure questions of law and erroneously taken to the CA “shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright.”[53]

Despite the absence of error on the part of the CA in dismissing petitioners’ appeal for being the wrong mode, the Court finds it imperative nonetheless to write finis to the issue at fore – the propriety of the dismissal of the Present Case by the RTC-Br. 138 on the ground of res judicata.

The filing of the Present Case should not be construed as barred by res judicata.
The focal issue in the present recourse centers on the effect of the First Dismissal Order issued by the RTC-Br. 138 on the continuance of the proceedings in the Present Case – whether it operated as res judicata warranting the dismissal of the Present Case.

Res judicata in its concept as “bar by prior judgment” under Section 47(b)[54] of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court requires the concurrence of the following requisites: “(1) the former judgment is final; (2) it is rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it is a judgment or an order on the merits; and (4) there is, between the first and the second actions, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.”[55]

Anent the first, second, and fourth requisites, the parties do not dispute the fact that RTC-Br. 58 has jurisdiction over the First Case, and the First Dismissal Order has long become final and executory for petitioners’ failure to appeal it. There is also, between the First Case and the Present Case, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action, viz.: the parties in the Present Case are the same parties in the First Case;[56] the real property formerly covered by TCT No. RT-57 (9482) is also the same property subject of the controversy in both cases;[57] and the causes of action in the two cases are also the same—that is, the declaration of nullity of the deed of sale between Arnold and Felipe covering the subject property, the consequent annulment of TCT Nos. 225363 and 225428 respectively issued in the names of Arnold and Felipe, and the claim for damages.[58]

With the peculiar factual circumstances obtaining in the case, however, the Court resolves that the First Dismissal Order, which respondents claim constitute a bar to the filing of the Present Case, does not comply with the third requisite above – that the order must be on the merits.

In dismissing the Present Case, the RTC-Br. 138 subscribed to the contention of respondents that the cause of action in the Present Case was barred by the First Dismissal Order for failure of the petitioners and their counsel to appear during the scheduled pre-trial hearing dates in the First Case. The RTC-Br. 138 ruled that the dismissal, which was a dismissal with prejudice, amounted to an adjudication on the merits of the case in consonance with Sections 4[59] and 5,[60] Rule 18 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (the Rules).

In the present recourse, petitioners aver that the First Dismissal Order should be deemed to be one without prejudice and should not be considered as an adjudication on the merits because they were deprived of their family home without due process of law.[61] Petitioners assert that their failure to attend the mandatory pre-trial hearing was due to the gross and palpable negligence amounting to bad faith on the part of their counsel therein, who failed to attend the pre-trial hearings and notify them of the hearings despite due notice from the court; neither did their counsel inform them of the First Dismissal Order nor appeal therefrom.[62] They plead that they should not be bound by the gross negligence of their counsel who practically abandoned their case. Petitioners, therefore, pray that the Rules of Court be liberally interpreted in their favor; that their instant petition for review be given due course as to allow them an opportunity to defend and protect their property through a full-blown trial on the merits rather than lose their home to technicalities.

Petitioners’ supplication holds water and is worthy of solace. Considering the factual milieu of the case, it behooves the Court to negate the application of res judicata on the ground that the First Dismissal Order did not operate as an adjudication on the merits or determination of the rights of the parties in the First Case. The First Case was dismissed by the RTC-Br. 58 not on the merits but on a technicality – that is, the failure of the petitioners and their counsel to attend the pre-trial hearing.

While it has been settled that the consequence of the plaintiff’s non-appearance in the pre-trial is the dismissal of the case with prejudice,[63] the Court deems the dismissal with prejudice as harsh considering respondents’ apparent lack of legal title to the subject property and their patent indefensible attempt to obtain, in utter bad faith, registration of the title to the subject property in their names.

From the allegations in petitioners’ complaint in the First Case, it bears to note that after petitioners learned of the mortgage of the subject property to Arnold, they immediately filed Civil Case No. 98-1360 for the cancellation of the mortgage entry in the title to the subject property. The RTC in said case nullified Arnold’s extrajudicial foreclosure on the ground of prescription and for noncompliance with the requirements of notice and publication under Act No. 3135; the Decision was affirmed by the CA and became final and executory for Arnold’s failure to appeal it. Despite the final and immutable judgment declaring the foreclosure void, Arnold, as the buyer of the subject property at the auction sale, caused the issuance in his name of TCT No. 225363 on September 9, 2008. Eight days later, Arnold sold the property to Felipe, who was well aware of Arnold’s lack of legal title. In fact, the records show that, in a separate complaint filed by Felipe and his mother, they claimed to be owners of the subject property in their own right and questioned Felipe’s title thereto likewise subscribing to petitioners’ position in Civil Case No. 98-1360 that Arnold’s mortgage right had already prescribed.

Against this background, the Court deems that the First Dismissal Order did not effectively amount to a prior judgment which would bar the re-litigation of petitioners’ causes of action in the Present Case in view of the fact that petitioners were deprived of the opportunity to be heard on their cause of action. As it should have been, the said dismissal should be construed as without prejudice for violating petitioners’ right to due process if only to grant them the opportunity to refile the case to ventilate their cause of action. Stated thus, the First Dismissal Order did not substantially amount to res judicata which would warrant the dismissal of the Present Case.

The doctrine of res judicata is a rule of justice and cannot be rigidly applied where it will result in injustice.[64] As aptly held by the Court in Salud v. Court of Appeals,[65]

There is universal agreement on the principles underlying res judicata, viz.:

“x x x Two maxims of the English common law best summarize the general policies underlying this doctrine. They are: first, that no person should be twice vexed by the same claim; and second, that it is in the interest of the state that there be an end to litigation. Thus, principles of res judicata serve both private and public interests.

The interest of the judicial system in preventing relitigation of the same dispute recognizes that judicial resources are finite and the number of cases that can be heard by the court is limited. Every dispute that is reheard means that another will be delayed. In modem times when court dockets are filled to overflowing, this concern is of critical importance. Res judicata thus conserves scarce judicial resources and promotes efficiency in the interest of the public at large.

Once a final judgment has been rendered, the prevailing party also has an interest in the stability of that judgment. Parties come to the courts in order to resolve controversies; a judgment would be of little use in resolving disputes if the parties were free to ignore it and to litigate the same claims again and again. Although judicial determinations are not infallible, judicial error should be corrected through appeals procedures, not through repeated suits on the same claim. Further, to allow relitigation creates the risk of inconsistent results and presents the embarrassing problem of determining which of two conflicting decisions is to be preferred. Since there is no reason to suppose that the second or third determination of a claim necessarily is more accurate than the first, the first should be left undisturbed.

In some cases the public at large also has an interest in seeing that rights and liabilities once established remain fixed. If a court quiets title to land, for example, everyone should be able to rely on the finality of that determination. Otherwise, many business transactions would be clouded by uncertainty. Thus, the most important purpose of res judicata is to provide repose for both the party litigants and the public. As the Supreme Court has observed, ‘res judicata thus encourages reliance on judicial decision, bars vexatious litigation, and frees the courts to resolve other disputes.”‘

In our age, where courts are harassed by crowded dockets and complaints against slow foot justice, frequent technical reliance on the preclusive breadth of res judicata is understandable. The importance of judicial economy and avoidance of repetitive suits are strong norms i[n] a society in need of swift justice. Be that as it may, there should not be a mechanical and uncaring reliance on res judicata where more important societal values deserve protection. So we held in Suarez vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,

Assuming in gratia argumenti that the prior judgment of dismissal with prejudice was validly rendered within the lawful discretion of the court and could be considered as an adjudication on the merits, nonetheless, the principle of res judicata should be disregarded if its application would involve the sacrifice of justice to technicality x x x. The application of the said principle, under the particular facts obtaining, would amount to denial of justice and/or bar to a vindication of a legitimate grievance x x x.

The case at bench presents an exceptional instance where an inflexible application of the doctrine of res judicata will not serve our constitutional policy favoring fairness, the heart of due process. x x x.

x x x. The demands of due process present a weightier consideration than the need to bring an end to the parties’ litigation. For more important than the need to write finis to litigation is to finish it justly, and there can be no justice that satisfies unless the litigants are given the opportunity to be heard. x x x.[66] (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)

Petitioners’ case merits the relaxation of procedural rules.
Given the circumstances, the Court cannot but spare a thought for the desperate plight of petitioners who stand to lose their home to a technicality and to respondents’ elusive schemes. Respondents’ repulsive disregard of a final and executory decision and their unscrupulous manipulation of the technical rules of procedure to suit their ignoble ends demonstrates a flagrant denigration of justice.

Substantial justice begs that the merits of petitioners’ cause be passed upon considering that no prejudice will result to Felipe who does not stand to lose the subject property over which he never had title in the first instance. If petitioners’ allegations in their complaint are established during the trial, Arnold and Felipe will have no right to claim a better title to the subject property as against petitioners. Besides, because the registration of respondents’ titles was done in bad faith, it is as if there was no registration at all.[67] Registration does not vest title; it is merely the evidence of such title for our land registration laws do not give the holder any better title than what he actually has.[68]

The Court applauds the zealousness of the RTC-Br. 138 in upholding the Rules and in consequently dismissing the Present Case on the ground of res judicata; however, the application of this principle cannot be made the basis to deny petitioners the opportunity to a fair trial to prove their claim as against respondents.

Indeed, while procedural rules “are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party’s substantive rights,”[69] the Court has nonetheless been consistent in its rulings that the law abhors the technicalities that impede the cause of action.[70] If the application of the Rules would tend to frustrate rather than promote justice, it is always within our power to suspend the Rules, or except a particular case from its operation.[71] Thus, in Commissioner of Customs v. PTT Philippines Trading Corp.,[72] the Court held that:

Rules of Procedure should not be rigidly applied if it will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice. Depending on the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.[73]

In Heirs of Lagon v. Ultramax Healthcare Supplies, Inc.,[74] the Court emphasized that rules of procedure are not so rigid as to frustrate the full adjudication of cases:

x x x. Procedural rules are designed to aid the courts in resolving cases. They neither create nor take away vested rights, but merely facilitate the trial court’s reception and evaluation of all evidence given the facts and circumstances presented by the parties. They give litigants the opportunity to establish the merits of their complaint or defense rather than lose life, liberty, or property on mere technicalities. This Court should not demand a strict application of these rules when such would exacerbate the situation rather than promote substantial justice.[75] (Citations omitted)

From a consideration of the events that transpired in the case, the Court finds good reason to support petitioners’ assertion that the First Dismissal Order should not be construed as tantamount to an adjudication on the merits considering that, on top of respondents’ wily scheme to mask their lack of legal title over the subject property, petitioners were denied their right to present their case ostensibly due to the gross negligence of their counsel whose failure to apprise them of the developments in the case eventually led to the dismissal of the First Case to the extreme prejudice and damage of the petitioners. This being so, said dismissal cannot be the basis of res judicata; it cannot be a bar to a lawful claim. If at all, the first dismissal order may be considered as one without prejudice.[76]

While as a general rule the negligence of the counsel binds the client, one of the exceptions is when the counsel’s actuations are gross or palpable, resulting in serious injustice to the client.[77] A lawyer is deemed to be grossly negligent when he or she fails to exercise even the slightest degree of care or diligence, or entirely omits the same. Gross negligence examines a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them.[78]

As borne by the records, the RTC-Br. 58 finally dismissed[79] the First Case after both petitioners and their counsel failed to attend the pre-trial hearing dates set by the trial court four times despite due notice. Petitioners’ counsel explicated that while the notices were received by his office staff, they were misplaced and he was not informed about them. In its Order[80] dated May 2, 2014, the RTC-Br. 58 admonished petitioners’ counsel for his apparent neglect in keeping an orderly system for the receipt of judicial notices, but nonetheless denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration of the First Dismissal Order.

Indeed, a lawyer owes it to himself or herself and to his or her clients to adopt an efficient and orderly system of receiving and attending promptly to all judicial notices lest he or she and his or her clients suffer the consequences of one’s failure to do so.

However, when the incompetence, ignorance or inexperience of counsel is so great and the result is so serious that the client, who otherwise has a good cause, is prejudiced and denied his or her day in court, the client deserves another chance to present his or her case.[81] Apparently, petitioners were prevented from fully and fairly presenting their First Case and ran the risk of losing their home because of the professional delinquency or infidelity of their counsel. Moreover, where a case was not tried on the merits and was dismissed due to the negligence of counsel rather than the plaintiff, in the interest of justice, the dismissal of the case should be decreed to be without prejudice to the filing of a new action;[82] thus, negating the applicability of res judicata.

The Court cannot hold to technicalities at the expense of frustrating substantive rights. The resolve to reinstate the instant complaint and allow petitioners the opportunity to present their case in court will be more in accord with the Court’s duty to effectively dispense justice. The Court accedes to petitioners’ asseveration that their case falls under the exception to the rule that the negligence of counsel binds the client. In Tamboa v. People,[83] the Court ruled:

x x x. What should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on technicalities. Corollarily, the rule, which states that the mistakes of counsel bind the client, may not be strictly followed where observance of it would result in the outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property, or where the interest of justice so requires.[84]

The Court reiterates that it is the avowed policy of the law to accord both parties every opportunity to pursue and defend their cases in the open and relegate technicality to the background in the interest of substantial justice.[85] Respondents herein cannot be allowed to engage in a game of technicalities as a convenient subterfuge for causes which are unjustified and fraudulent; lest the Court tolerate the prostitution of the rules of procedure to breed injustice.

[ G.R. No. 222957. March 29, 2023 ]
ATTY. ROGELIO B. DE GUZMAN, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES BARTOLOME AND SUSAN SANTOS, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



GAERLAN, J.:
For resolution is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated December 18, 2014 and the Resolution[3] dated February 18, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 100706. The CA in its assailed rulings affirmed the Order[4] dated January 31, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Antipolo City, Branch 73, in Civil Case No. 01-6204.
Petitioner Rogelio B. De Guzman (De Guzman) owned a house and lot located at Lot 1, Block II, New York Street, Cresdaville II Subdivision, Bangiad, San Juan, Taytay, Rizal (Subject Property). The lot was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 5788.[5]

In November 2000, De Guzman accepted the offer of respondents Bartolome and Susan Santos (collectively, spouses Santos) to purchase the Subject Property. They executed a Contract to Sell which stipulated the purchase price of P1,500,000.00. The terms of payment included a down payment of P250,000.00 upon signing of the contract, and succeeding monthly installments of P15,000.00 until full payment. The unpaid balance of the principal would earn interest at the rate of 9% per annum. In return, the spouses Santos were given permission to take immediate possession of the Subject Property and use it as their residence.[6]

The spouses Santos paid De Guzman the down payment on November 15, 2000 and moved in. They lived there but did not pay the monthly installments agreed upon. In February 2001, they unilaterally decided to vacate the Subject Property and return to their old residence at Angono, Rizal.[7]

On June 21, 2001, the spouses Santos filed a complaint for rescission of the Contract to Sell, recovery of down payment, and damages against De Guzman. They deducted a reasonable rental rate of P10,000.00 per month for the period they lived there and demanded the return of the balance of their down payment in the total amount of P208,500.00.[8]

The RTC initially rendered its Decision dated June 10, 2008 which dismissed the spouses Santos’ complaint and ordered them to pay the balance of the purchase price to De Guzman.[9] The dispositive portion reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the Defendant and against the Plaintiffs as follows:

1. The instant case is hereby dismissed for lack of cause of action; and

2. Ordering plaintiffs to pay P1,250,000.00 representing the balance on the house and lot with 9% interest thereon from January, 2001 until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[10]

The spouses Santos timely filed a Motion for New Trial on the basis of their discovery that De Guzman sold the Subject Property to a certain Elizabeth Algoso (Algoso) during the pendency of the case on August 17, 2005.[11] De Guzman filed an Opposition arguing that a Motion for New Trial was not the correct remedy because there was no newly discovered evidence as contemplated under the Rules of Court.[12]

The RTC granted the spouses Santos’ Motion for New Trial and set the case for hearing. After trial, it eventually issued its Order setting aside its earlier Decision and declaring the Contract to Sell as rescinded. It likewise ordered De Guzman to return the balance of the spouses Santos’ down payment:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of this Court dated June 10, 2008, is hereby set aside. The Contract to Sell between the plaintiffs and the defendant is deemed rescinded. Defendant is ordered to return to plaintiffs the balance of the downpayment amounting to P208,500.00 with interest of 6% per annum from the time of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[13]

The RTC ruled that De Guzman’s act of selling the Subject Property without notifying it or the other litigants was indicative of bad faith and made the disposition of the case moot. Hence, there was no more sale to speak of which necessitated the return of any amounts received. It elucidated:

It should be remembered that this present case originated from an action for the rescission of contract, recovery of downpayment plus damages. The Court ruled that plaintiffs had no cause of action against the defendant because they cannot raise as a defense for not fulfilling their obligation the alleged hidden defects on the property subject of this case. Thus, the Court finding no reason to rescind the contract ordered the plaintiffs to fulfill their obligation to pay the balance on the house and lot with 9% interest from January 2001, until fully paid.

This Court proceeded with the trial on the premise that the parties maintained the status quo on the property, i.e.[,] that however the court will decide the case, the property is free from encumbrance.

The Court agrees with the argument of the defendant that since the instrument between the parties is a Contract to Sell, he has no obligation to the plaintiffs to transfer ownership over the property until and unless substantial payment [has] been effected. In the same manner, and as [e]nunciated in Garcia vs. CA, supra, plaintiff’s failure to tender their payment is ‘not a breach, casual or serious.’

However, the fact that the defendant even raised in his Answer that plaintiffs should ‘be adjudged to pay P1,250,000.00 to defendant as unpaid balance of the latter’s house and lot with 9% interest thereon from January 2001 until actually fully paid,’ and proceeded to [defend] the contract as if [it was] still binding and worse, made this Court believe that the property is free from encumbrance, he cannot now argue that he has no obligation to transfer the property to plaintiffs or even to inform them of his intention to sell the same during the pendency of his case.

When a thing is the subject of a judicial controversy, it should ultimately be bound by whatever disposition the court shall render. The parties to the case are therefore expected, in deference to the court’s exercise of jurisdiction over the case, to refrain from doing acts, which would dissipate or debase the thing subject of the litigation or otherwise render the impending decision therein ineffectual. Further, any disposition of the thing subject of litigation or any act which tends to render inutile the court’s impending disposition in such case, sans the knowledge and approval of the litigants or of the court, is unmistakably and irrefutably indicative of bad faith. Such acts undermine the authority of the court to lay down the respective rights of the parties in a case relative to the thing subject of litigation and bind them to such determination. (Baylon v. Baylon, G.R. No. 182435, Aug. 13, 2012)

Article 1381(4) of the Civil Code requires that any contract entered into by a party in a case which refers to a property under litigation should be with the knowledge and approval of the litigants or of a competent judicial authority, thus –

Article 1381(4) – The following contracts are rescissible:

x x x x

(4) Those which refer to things under litigation if they have been entered into by the defendants without the knowledge and approval of the litigants or of competent judicial authority.

Article 1381(4) seeks to remedy the presence of bad faith among the parties to a case and/or any fraudulent act, which they may commit with respect to the thing [in] litigation. When a thing is the subject of a judicial controversy, it should ultimately be bound by whatever disposition the court shall render. (Baylon, supra)

Defendant is a lawyer and is an officer of this Court. In fact, he represented himself in the proceedings before this Court. Rule 10.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states that a lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he mislead or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice.

Being his own lawyer, he could have easily informed the Court of his intentions and actions that he has sold the property, which could have saved the Court’s time, considering that the property was sold even before a decision was issued by this Court. The actions of defendant [were] contemptible to say the least.

The act of defendant in selling the property had rendered the disposition of this case ineffective. Thus, plaintiffs have the right, if they would want to, to seek the [rescission] of the sale of the property to Elizabeth Algoso. Obviously, this is not the intention of the plaintiffs in asking for new trial. On the contrary, they do not want to have anything to do with the property subject of this litigation, and are probably just glad that the same [has] been sold.

There is[,] however, the sum of money, which was given to the defendant by the plaintiffs which the latter sought to be returned to them. The Court in its original decision, finding no reason to rescind the contract, regarded the sum of money as part of the consideration of the sale. Now that there is no sale between the plaintiffs and the defendant to speak of due to the fault, almost fraudulent act of defendant, then the sum of money should be returned to plaintiffs less the amount for the use of the property which shall be considered as rental payment.[14] (Emphases and underscoring supplied)

De Guzman appealed to the CA questioning the propriety of the remedy of a Motion for New Trial and the legality of the RTC Order.

The CA rendered its assailed Decision[15] denying the appeal and affirming the RTC Order:

WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated January 31, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo City, Branch 73 in Civil Case No. 01-6204 is hereby AFFIRMED.

SO ORDERED.[16] (Emphases in the original)

The CA concurred with the RTC that De Guzman’s act of selling the Subject Property while the case was pending without any notice or authority constituted bad faith, deception, and fraud. The transfer of the property to a third party rendered the enforcement of the Contract to Sell moot and academic. It thus upheld the grant of a new trial by the RTC to prevent the failure of justice, and to address the irregularities brought about by De Guzman’s actions which prejudiced the spouses Santos’ substantive rights. Ultimately, it held that the RTC Order was justified in the broader interest of justice and equity.[17]

De Guzman sought reconsideration[18] of the Decision but was denied by the CA in its Resolution.[19]

Hence, the instant petition.[20]

De Guzman in his petition maintained that the assailed rulings of the CA were contrary to law since the remedy of rescission does not apply to a Contract to Sell.[21] It was spouses Santos’ own failure to comply with their obligations which rendered the contract ineffective. Further, there was no basis for them to seek reimbursement of their down payment.[22] On the contrary, their Contract to Sell explicitly provides that the spouses Santos’ failure to pay the monthly installments shall result in the automatic cancellation of the contract and forfeiture of all the payments made.[23]

The spouses Santos in response filed a Comment-Opposition to the Petition[24] to the petition. They insisted that the CA Decision was correct and emphasized that reimbursement of their down payment was necessary to prevent De Guzman’s unjust enrichment.[25] They also reiterated how the act of selling the Subject Property during the pendency of the case was done in bad faith and rendered the Contract to Sell rescissible.[26]

De Guzman filed a Reply[27] to the Comment-Opposition. He thereafter filed a Memorandum,[28] to which the spouses Santos filed a Comment/ Opposition.[29]



The issues in this case are:

Whether or not the CA correctly affirmed the rescission of the Contract to Sell.
Whether or not De Guzman is liable to reimburse the spouses Santos their down payment.


After a judicious review, the petition is granted.

A Contract to Sell is defined as “a bilateral contract whereby the prospective seller, while expressly reserving the ownership of the subject property despite delivery thereof to the prospective buyer, binds himself to sell the said property exclusively to the prospective buyer upon fulfillment of the condition agreed upon, that is, full payment of the purchase price.”[30]

The peculiar characteristic of a Contract to Sell is that the seller retains legal title to the property to be sold until the buyer fully pays the purchase price. The full payment of the purchase price is a positive suspensive condition, the non-fulfillment of which does not constitute a breach of contract, but merely an event that prevents the seller from conveying title to the buyer.[31]

Considering that non-payment of the full purchase price does not amount to a breach of contract, the remedy of specific performance cannot be availed of. The remedy of rescission is also unavailable since it is impossible to rescind an obligation that is non-existing, the suspensive condition not having happened yet.[32] The buyer’s non-payment thus only renders the contract to sell ineffective and without force and effect.[33] This Court has even pronounced that the failure to make full payment of the purchase price in a contract to sell is not really a breach, serious or otherwise, and therefore not a sufficient ground to award damages.[34]

On the other hand, the seller has no obligation to transfer ownership over the property to the intending buyer until they execute a contract of sale after full payment of the purchase price, even if they already entered into a contract to sell.[35] It was thus recognized in Spouses Roque v. Aguado[36] (Spouses Roque) that the seller retains the freedom and legal right to sell the property to a third party before the intending buyer’s full payment of the purchase price. It was explained in Coronel v. CA[37] (Coronel) that such sale to third party is legal because prior to full payment of the purchase price, there is no defect in the seller’s title per se. In such an event, the intending buyer under the contract to sell is not even entitled to reconveyance of the property sold to the third party and can at most seek damages against the seller. The Court in Coronel pertinently held:

In a contract to sell, upon the fulfillment of the suspensive condition which is the full payment of the purchase price, ownership will not automatically transfer to the buyer although the property may have been previously delivered to him. The prospective seller still has to convey title to the prospective buyer by entering into a contract of absolute sale.

It is essential to distinguish between a contract to sell and a conditional contract of sale specially in cases where the subject property is sold by the owner not to the party the seller contracted with, but to a third person, as in the case at bench. In a contract to sell, there being no previous sale of the property, a third person buying such property despite the fulfillment of the suspensive condition such as the full payment of the purchase price, for instance, cannot be deemed a buyer in bad faith and the prospective buyer cannot seek the relief of reconveyance of the property. There is no double sale in such case. Title to the property will transfer to the buyer after registration because there is no defect in the owner-seller’s title per se, but the latter, of course, may be used for damages by the intending buyer.[38] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Based on the foregoing, the assailed CA Decision and Resolution in this case must be reversed for being contrary to prevailing law and jurisprudence.

To recall, the RTC rescinded the Contract to Sell because of De Guzman’s act of selling the Subject Property in bad faith during the trial stage. He was then ordered to reimburse the down payment since there was allegedly no longer any existing sale between the parties. This was affirmed by the CA ruling that the sale to a third party rendered the enforcement of the Contract to Sell moot and academic. It additionally ruled that this was necessary in the broader interest of justice and equity.[39]

This Court rules that the CA erred in affirming the rescission of the Contract to Sell and the order for De Guzman to reimburse the down payment. Although his act of selling the Subject Property to Algoso during the trial stage constituted bad faith, it was not a legal ground for rescission pursuant to Article 1381(4) of the New Civil Code. This was likewise not a sufficient ground to nullify it under any existing laws.

Following the doctrines in Spouses Roque and Coronel, De Guzman’s sale to Algoso was legal and valid because there was still no defect in his title to the Subject Property at the time. It is undisputed that the spouses Santos did not fully pay the purchase price to obligate the sale of the Subject Property exclusively to them.

The spouses Santos were not entitled to seek the rescission of the Contract to Sell as the RTC erroneously granted in its Order. Necessarily, its order directing De Guzman to reimburse the down payment on the ground that there was no longer any sale between the parties was also erroneous. At most, the spouses Santos could only demand the payment of damages from De Guzman for selling the Subject Property prior to their full payment of the purchase price.

Having established the foregoing, the remaining ground to possibly justify the order for De Guzman to reimburse the down payment is the CA’s finding that it was necessary in the broader interest of justice and equity.

In this regard, an analysis of the circumstances of this case warrants a reversal of the CA rulings. The determination of this issue involves factual matters which are generally beyond the scope of petitions filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, this case falls under an exception when the assailed judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.[40]

It is clear from the evidence on record that the spouses Santos were the parties first in bad faith in complying with their obligations under the Contract to Sell. They readily admitted in their complaint that they stayed on the Subject Property for four months but deliberately did not pay even a single installment agreed upon. They also never had any intention of complying with their obligations as evidenced by the fact that they unilaterally abandoned the Subject Property. This blatant disregard for their contractual obligations prior to the filing of their complaint reeked of bad faith and must be considered in determining what is just and equitable.

However, it is also undeniable that De Guzman committed a grave fault and was guilty of bad faith when he sold the Subject Property to Algoso during the trial stage without any judicial authorization. This made the enforcement of the Contract to Sell moot and academic, and constituted a violation of his duties to the court.

Consequently, the spouses Santos are not entitled to seek protection from the courts because they themselves were guilty of grossly violating the Contract to Sell. It is settled that parties who come to court with unclean hands must not be allowed to profit from their own wrongdoings. The parties seeking equity must be free from fault.[41] The fact that they violated the Contract to Sell and then filed the instant case to try and escape the consequences cannot be countenanced by this Court.

In the same vein, De Guzman cannot be granted any judicial relief in the form of damages since he was guilty of bad faith in selling the Subject Property to Algoso without any judicial authorization.

It is apparent from the foregoing that the parties in this case are in pari delicto, or “in equal fault.” In such cases, the parties shall have no action against each other and the courts shall leave them where it finds them.[42] The CA therefore gravely erred in ordering De Guzman to reimburse the down payment in the interest of justice and equity for lack of legal and factual basis.

Lastly, this Court stresses that its non-intervention with the parties leaves the Contract to Sell to govern the adjudication of their rights. Significantly, paragraph 1 of the Contract to Sell states that the dishonor of three checks covering payments of the installments due shall result in the automatic cancellation of the contract and the forfeiture of all payments made:

1.
The purchase price of the house and lot is ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P1,500,000.00), Philippine Currency, payable by the Vendees as follows:
                   
a.
Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P250,000.00) upon the signing of this Contract;
                   
b.
The balance of One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P1,250,000.00) shall be paid in equal installment of FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15,000.00) Philippine Currency, every month with an interest of Nine Percent (9%) per annum the total amount of which shall be computed and paid after full payment of the principal amount hereof;
                   
c.
The Vendees shall issue upon signing hereof twelve (12) checks as payment for every year installment of twelve (12) months encashable every last day of the month and every year thereafter until the total amount hereof is actually and fully paid;
                   
d.
The Vendees shall avoid [dishonor] of any of the checks they will issue in payment of the house and lot of the Vendor, otherwise, any three (3) successive dishonor of the said checks shall be a ground for automatic cancellation of this Contract and forfeiture of all payment[s] made to the Vendor.[43] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
By applying the clear provisions of the Contract to Sell, the spouses Santos’ admission of default for the four months they stayed on the Subject Property should have resulted in the automatic cancellation of the contract and the forfeiture of all their payments made.

It is only fair, just, and equitable to apply the provisions of the Contract to Sell which both parties voluntarily and intelligently agreed upon. This is in line with the fundamental principle that obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the parties and should be complied with in good faith.[44]

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is granted. The Decision dated December 18, 2014 and the Resolution dated February 18, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 100706 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

SO ORDERED.

Caguioa (Chairperson), J., see separate opinion.

","For resolution is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated December 18, 2014 and the Resolution[3] dated February 18, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 100706. The CA in its assailed rulings affirmed the Order[4] dated January 31, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Antipolo City, Branch 73, in Civil Case No. 01-6204.
Petitioner Rogelio B. De Guzman (De Guzman) owned a house and lot located at Lot 1, Block II, New York Street, Cresdaville II Subdivision, Bangiad, San Juan, Taytay, Rizal (Subject Property). The lot was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 5788.[5]

In November 2000, De Guzman accepted the offer of respondents Bartolome and Susan Santos (collectively, spouses Santos) to purchase the Subject Property. They executed a Contract to Sell which stipulated the purchase price of P1,500,000.00. The terms of payment included a down payment of P250,000.00 upon signing of the contract, and succeeding monthly installments of P15,000.00 until full payment. The unpaid balance of the principal would earn interest at the rate of 9% per annum. In return, the spouses Santos were given permission to take immediate possession of the Subject Property and use it as their residence.[6]

The spouses Santos paid De Guzman the down payment on November 15, 2000 and moved in. They lived there but did not pay the monthly installments agreed upon. In February 2001, they unilaterally decided to vacate the Subject Property and return to their old residence at Angono, Rizal.[7]

On June 21, 2001, the spouses Santos filed a complaint for rescission of the Contract to Sell, recovery of down payment, and damages against De Guzman. They deducted a reasonable rental rate of P10,000.00 per month for the period they lived there and demanded the return of the balance of their down payment in the total amount of P208,500.00.[8]

The RTC initially rendered its Decision dated June 10, 2008 which dismissed the spouses Santos’ complaint and ordered them to pay the balance of the purchase price to De Guzman.[9] The dispositive portion reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the Defendant and against the Plaintiffs as follows:

1. The instant case is hereby dismissed for lack of cause of action; and

2. Ordering plaintiffs to pay P1,250,000.00 representing the balance on the house and lot with 9% interest thereon from January, 2001 until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.[10]

The spouses Santos timely filed a Motion for New Trial on the basis of their discovery that De Guzman sold the Subject Property to a certain Elizabeth Algoso (Algoso) during the pendency of the case on August 17, 2005.[11] De Guzman filed an Opposition arguing that a Motion for New Trial was not the correct remedy because there was no newly discovered evidence as contemplated under the Rules of Court.[12]

He was then ordered to reimburse the down payment since there was allegedly no longer any existing sale between the parties. This was affirmed by the CA ruling that the sale to a third party rendered the enforcement of the Contract to Sell moot and academic. It additionally ruled that this was necessary in the broader interest of justice and equity.[39]

This Court rules that the CA erred in affirming the rescission of the Contract to Sell and the order for De Guzman to reimburse the down payment. Although his act of selling the Subject Property to Algoso during the trial stage constituted bad faith, it was not a legal ground for rescission pursuant to Article 1381(4) of the New Civil Code. This was likewise not a sufficient ground to nullify it under any existing laws.

Following the doctrines in Spouses Roque and Coronel, De Guzman’s sale to Algoso was legal and valid because there was still no defect in his title to the Subject Property at the time. It is undisputed that the spouses Santos did not fully pay the purchase price to obligate the sale of the Subject Property exclusively to them.

The spouses Santos were not entitled to seek the rescission of the Contract to Sell as the RTC erroneously granted in its Order. Necessarily, its order directing De Guzman to reimburse the down payment on the ground that there was no longer any sale between the parties was also erroneous. At most, the spouses Santos could only demand the payment of damages from De Guzman for selling the Subject Property prior to their full payment of the purchase price.

Having established the foregoing, the remaining ground to possibly justify the order for De Guzman to reimburse the down payment is the CA’s finding that it was necessary in the broader interest of justice and equity.

In this regard, an analysis of the circumstances of this case warrants a reversal of the CA rulings. The determination of this issue involves factual matters which are generally beyond the scope of petitions filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, this case falls under an exception when the assailed judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.[40]

It is clear from the evidence on record that the spouses Santos were the parties first in bad faith in complying with their obligations under the Contract to Sell. They readily admitted in their complaint that they stayed on the Subject Property for four months but deliberately did not pay even a single installment agreed upon. They also never had any intention of complying with their obligations as evidenced by the fact that they unilaterally abandoned the Subject Property. This blatant disregard for their contractual obligations prior to the filing of their complaint reeked of bad faith and must be considered in determining what is just and equitable.

However, it is also undeniable that De Guzman committed a grave fault and was guilty of bad faith when he sold the Subject Property to Algoso during the trial stage without any judicial authorization. This made the enforcement of the Contract to Sell moot and academic, and constituted a violation of his duties to the court.

Consequently, the spouses Santos are not entitled to seek protection from the courts because they themselves were guilty of grossly violating the Contract to Sell. It is settled that parties who come to court with unclean hands must not be allowed to profit from their own wrongdoings. The parties seeking equity must be free from fault.[41] The fact that they violated the Contract to Sell and then filed the instant case to try and escape the consequences cannot be countenanced by this Court.

In the same vein, De Guzman cannot be granted any judicial relief in the form of damages since he was guilty of bad faith in selling the Subject Property to Algoso without any judicial authorization.

It is apparent from the foregoing that the parties in this case are in pari delicto, or “in equal fault.” In such cases, the parties shall have no action against each other and the courts shall leave them where it finds them.[42] The CA therefore gravely erred in ordering De Guzman to reimburse the down payment in the interest of justice and equity for lack of legal and factual basis.

Lastly, this Court stresses that its non-intervention with the parties leaves the Contract to Sell to govern the adjudication of their rights. Significantly, paragraph 1 of the Contract to Sell states that the dishonor of three checks covering payments of the installments due shall result in the automatic cancellation of the contract and the forfeiture of all payments made:

1.
The purchase price of the house and lot is ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P1,500,000.00), Philippine Currency, payable by the Vendees as follows:
 	 	 
a.
Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P250,000.00) upon the signing of this Contract;
 	 	 
b.
The balance of One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P1,250,000.00) shall be paid in equal installment of FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15,000.00) Philippine Currency, every month with an interest of Nine Percent (9%) per annum the total amount of which shall be computed and paid after full payment of the principal amount hereof;
 	 	 
c.
The Vendees shall issue upon signing hereof twelve (12) checks as payment for every year installment of twelve (12) months encashable every last day of the month and every year thereafter until the total amount hereof is actually and fully paid;
 	 	 
d.
The Vendees shall avoid [dishonor] of any of the checks they will issue in payment of the house and lot of the Vendor, otherwise, any three (3) successive dishonor of the said checks shall be a ground for automatic cancellation of this Contract and forfeiture of all payment[s] made to the Vendor.[43] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
By applying the clear provisions of the Contract to Sell, the spouses Santos’ admission of default for the four months they stayed on the Subject Property should have resulted in the automatic cancellation of the contract and the forfeiture of all their payments made.

It is only fair, just, and equitable to apply the provisions of the Contract to Sell which both parties voluntarily and intelligently agreed upon. This is in line with the fundamental principle that obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the parties and should be complied with in good faith.[44]

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is granted. The Decision dated December 18, 2014 and the Resolution dated February 18, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 100706 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

[ G.R. No. 222068. July 25, 2023 ]
ARTHUR A. CANDELARIO, PETITIONER, VS. MARLENE E. CANDELARIO AND THE OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N



HERNANDO, J.:
This Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeks to set aside the March 6, 2015 Judgment[2] and the December 7, 2015 Order[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Jose, Antique, Branch 11, in Civil Case No. 2013-01-3848, which denied the Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage[4] filed by petitioner Arthur A. Candelario (Arthur) against respondent Marlene E. Candelario (Marlene).


Arthur and Marlene were married in a civil ceremony on June 11, 1984. Their marriage produced one child who was born on May 14, 1985. Hoping to provide a better life for her family, Marlene moved to Singapore to work as a domestic helper sometime in October 1987 and left her child under the care and custody of Arthur, who worked as a farmer.[5] While working in Singapore, Marlene sent her earnings to her family. However, Arthur took advantage of Marlene’s absence and frequently visited nightclubs where he later on met his present partner.[6]

Marlene heard about Arthur’s affair and decided to return to the Philippines in October 1989 without the latter’s knowledge. It was then when she discovered that Arthur and his new partner were already living together in their conjugal dwelling.[7] Because of this, Marlene separated from Arthur that same year. Meanwhile, Marlene took their child from the custody of Arthur and was eventually raised and cared for by Marlene’s sister and parents. For his part, Arthur continued to live with his partner and they had four children together.[8]

More than 20 years later, Arthur filed before the RTC a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, praying that his marriage with Marlene be declared void ab initio due to his psychological incapacity to comply with his essential marital obligations.[9]

Marlene was served with summons but failed to file a written answer. Consequently, the RTC ordered the provincial prosecutor to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether collusion existed between the parties. The investigation report negated the presence of collusion between Arthur and Marlene. At the scheduled pre-trial conference, Marlene was likewise absent, and subsequently, the RTC declared the pre-trial terminated and set the case for trial on the merits.[10]

During trial, Arthur testified on his own behalf. Additionally, Dr. Daisy L. Chua-Daquilanea (Dr. Chua-Daquilanea), a psychiatry practitioner for 20 years, also testified for Arthur by way of Judicial Affidavit, which she identified together with her Psychiatric Report.[11]

According to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea, she conducted a psychiatric evaluation of Arthur and Marlene based on a series of psychiatric interviews, mental status examinations, neurologic and physical examinations of the parties themselves and collateral data from the following persons: (a) Faustina Mendoza (Faustina), the owner of the land where Arthur worked; (b) Cerina Bardina (Cerina), a neighbor of the couple; and (c) Rizalyn Basilio (Rizalyn), the sister of Marlene. Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment revealed that Arthur was afflicted with Dependent Personality Disorder.[12] The Psychiatric Report stated that:

In view of the foregoing psychiatric evaluation, the petitioner is found to have a DEPENDENT PERSONALITY DISORDER. He was found to have an extreme pattern of dependency. This was due to low self-esteem and fear of abandonment from an overprotective parental figure. This psychological conflict affected his development such that this personality disorder was noted prior to the marriage and became more prominent during the marriage. It is found to be serious as he manifested with the full-blown signs and symptoms of this extreme dependency. It was the cause of his untoward behavior in marital life and made him incapable to do his marital obligations to love, care, respect, render support and fidelity to his spouse. It was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.

The respondent is not found to have any disorder as she was able to cope with the marital crisis and showed no deterioration in her functioning. She was rational in her decisions to improve the future of her child and of herself.

Therefore, the petition for nullity of marriage in this case is highly recommended based on the presence of a severe and irreversible personality disorder on the part of the petitioner.[13]

After his evidence were admitted by the trial court, Arthur rested his case. Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for resolution given that Marlene and the State opted not to present any evidence.[14]



In its March 6, 2015 Judgment,[15] the RTC denied Arthur’s Petition for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:

IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the verified PETITION dated January 18, 2013 of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario is hereby DENIED for lack of merit and, to all intents and purposes, this case is hereby dismissed.

Let separate copies of this judgment be furnished to Atty. Jenalyn A. Traifalgar, Prosecutor Marilou Garachico-Fabila, the Office of the Solicitor General, the respondent Marlene E. Candelario and the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario.

SO ORDERED.[16]

The RTC gave credence to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s psychiatric evaluation and found that Arthur’s psychological incapacity, which was characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, had been preponderantly established.[17] However, even if this were the case, the trial court ruled that his marriage to Marlene cannot be nullified or declared as void ab initio under Article 36 of the Family Code considering that the said Code only became effective on August 3, 1988, while Arthur and Marlene’s marriage was celebrated on June 11, 1984.[18]

Aggrieved, Arthur moved for reconsideration;[19] however, the same was denied through the trial court’s December 7, 2015 Order.[20]



Given the above, Arthur filed before this Court the present Petition for Review on Certiorari,[21] raising the lone assignment of error, viz.:

The [c]ourt a [quo] erred in finding that the Family Code of the Philippines, particularly Section [sic] Thirty-Six (36) thereof, providing Psychological Incapacity as a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage, has no retroactive effect.[22]

In a February 10, 2016 Resolution,[23] the Court resolved to implead the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in the instant case.[24] In compliance thereto, A11hur filed a Motion to Amend Petition and to Admit Amended Petition.[25]

Thereafter, in a March 14, 2016 Resolution,[26] the Court denied the Petition for “failure to sufficiently show that the trial court committed any reversible error in the challenged judgment and order as to warrant the exercise by this Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.”[27] It also stated that the Petition failed to comply with certain requirements under Rule 45 and other related provisions of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.[28]

Subsequently, Arthur filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated March 14, 2016.[29] Acting on such motion, the Court, in a July 25, 2016 Resolution,[30] required the respondents to file their respective comments thereon.[31]

In its Comment dated October 20, 2017,[32] the OSG disagreed with the RTC’s disquisition and opined that the latter erred in ruling that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be declared void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity on the part of petitioner, on the sole reason that their marriage was celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code.[33]

Meanwhile, after copies of the Resolutions were returned unserved, the Court issued a Resolution[34] on June 27, 2018 dispensing with the filing of Marlene’s Comment on Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration.

Consequently, on March 20, 2019, the Court granted Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration and set aside its March 14, 2016 Resolution.[35] It then required the parties to file their Comment to the Petition, to which the OSG filed its Manifestation In Lieu of Comment,[36] stating that it is adopting its Comment dated October 20, 2017 as its Comment to the Petition for Review on Certiorari.[37] On the other hand, Marlene still failed to file her Comment.

Thus, the Court will now proceed to determine the merits of the Petition.



The sole issue presented before this Court is whether the Family Code, particularly Art. 36 thereof, can be retroactively applied to marriages that took place before its effectivity on August 3, 1988, including that of Arthur and Marlene’s marriage, which was solemnized on June 11, 1984.


We deny the petition.
At the outset, it must be borne in mind that direct recourse to this Court from the decisions and final orders of the RTC may be taken where only questions of law are raised or involved. There is a question of law when the doubt arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, which does not call for the examination of the probative value of the evidence of the parties.[38] Here, the question on the retroactive application of the Family Code does not entail a review or evaluation of the evidence presented by Arthur at the trial court level. Verily, petitioner raised a pure question of law.

To recall, while the RTC found that Arthur’s Dependent Personality Disorder rendered him psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations, it nevertheless held that his marriage to Marlene, which was celebrated on June 11, 1984, cannot be dissolved on the ground of psychological incapacity because the Family Code did not yet exist during that time.[39] It held that the applicable law that was in effect during the celebration of their marriage was the Civil Code, which did not contain any provision similar to Art. 36 of the Family Code.[40]

The Court disagrees with the conclusion reached by the RTC.

The legal provisions that are pertinent to the case are Arts. 36, 39, and 256 of the Family Code, to wit:

Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.

Art. 39. The action or defense for the declaration of absolute nullity of a marriage shall not prescribe. (As amended by Executive Order 227 and Republic Act No. 8533; The phrase “However, in case of marriage celebrated before the effectivity of this Code and falling under Article 36, such action or defense shall prescribe in ten years after this Code shall have taken effect” has been deleted by Republic Act No. 8533 [Approved February 23, 1998]).

Art. 256. This Code shall have retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights in accordance with the Civil Code or other laws.

A plain reading of the above provisions would reveal that the Family Code, including its concept of psychological incapacity as a ground to nullify marriage, shall be given retroactive effect, to the extent that no vested or acquired rights under relevant laws will be prejudiced or impaired. The amendment of Art. 39 would also show that an action for nullifying a marriage is imprescriptible, without any distinction as to whether the marriage was solemnized before or after the effectivity of the Family Code.

Otherwise stated, nowhere does it state that Art. 36 cannot be retroactively applied to marriages that were celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code. Basic is the rule in statutory construction that where the law does not distinguish, the courts should not distinguish. Where the law is free from ambiguity, the court may not introduce exceptions or conditions where none is provided from considerations of convenience, public welfare, or for any laudable purpose; neither may it engraft into the law qualifications not contemplated.[41]

Moreover, it is worthy to point out that in Santos v. Court of Appeals,[42] this Court took the opportunity to discuss the import of psychological incapacity during the deliberations of the Family Code Revision Committee, to wit:

Justice Puno formulated the next Article as follows:

[Art.] 37. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated, to comply with the essential obligations of marriage shall likewise be void from the beginning even if such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization.

Justice Caguioa suggested that “even if” be substituted with “although.” On the other hand, Prof. Bautista proposed that the clause “although such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization” be deleted since it may encourage one to create the manifestation of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa pointed out that, as in other provisions, they cannot argue on the basis of abuse.

Judge Diy suggested that they also include mental and physical incapacities, which are lesser in degree than psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa explained that mental and physical incapacities are vices of consent while psychological incapacity is not a species of vice of consent.

Dean Gupit read what Bishop Cruz said on the matter in the minutes of their February 9, 1984 meeting:

“On the third ground, Bishop Cruz indicated that the phrase ‘psychological or mental impotence” is an invention of some churchmen who are moralists but not canonists, that is why it is considered a weak phrase. He said that the Code of Canon Law would rather express it as ‘psychological or mental incapacity to discharge…”

Justice Caguioa remarked that they deleted the word ‘mental’ precisely to distinguish it from vice of consent. He explained that ‘psychological incapacity’ refers to lack of understanding of the essential obligations of marriage.

Justice Puno reminded the members that, at the last meeting, they have decided not to go into the classification of “psychological incapacity” because there was a lot of debate on it and that this is precisely the reason why they classified it as a special case.

At this point, Justice Puno remarked that, since there having been annulments of marriages arising from psychological incapacity, Civil Law should not reconcile with Canon Law because it is a new ground even under Canon Law.

Prof. Romero raised the question: With this common provision in Civil Law and in Canon Law, are they going to have a provision in the Family Code to the effect that marriages annulled or declared void by the church on the ground of psychological incapacity is automatically annulled in Civil Law? The other members replied negatively.

Justice Puno and Prof. Romero inquired if Article 37 should be retroactive or prospective in application.

Justice Diy opined that she was for its retroactivity because it is their answer to the problem of church annulments of marriages, which are still valid under the Civil Law. On the other hand, Justice Reyes and Justice Puno were concerned about the avalanche of cases.

Dean Gupit suggested that they put the issue to a vote, which the Committee approved.

The members voted as follows:

(1) Justice Reyes, Justice Puno and Prof. Romero were for prospectivity.
(2) Justice Caguioa, Judge Diy, Dean Gupit, Prof. Bautista and Director Eufemio were for retroactivity.
(3) Prof. Baviera abstained.

Justice Caguioa suggested that they put in the prescriptive period of ten years within which the action for declaration of nullity of the marriage should be filed in court. The Committee approved the suggestion.[43]

From the foregoing, it can be gleaned that the Family Code Revision Committee actually took into consideration and voted on the retroactive application of Art. 36. In this regard, even if Arthur and Marlene’s marriage took place before the effectivity of the Family Code, the same can be declared void on the ground of Arthur’s psychological incapacity, as long as no vested or acquired rights are disturbed.

On this score, it must be noted that the records are bereft of any indication that there were vested or acquired rights that were prejudiced or impaired in this case. As mentioned by Arthur in his Petition, “[d]uring their marriage, the spouses have not acquired real and personal properties of significant value.”[44] It bears emphasis that if Marlene had an actual vested or acquired right that would be prejudiced should the Family Code be given retroactive effect, she should have raised such matter at the first possible instance or at any given stage of the proceedings where she was required to file an answer or comment. However, this she did not do. For failure to avail herself of the several opportunities given to her, she is deemed to have waived her right to prove and testify on such matter.

Additionally, the petitioner also correctly pointed out that there have already been numerous cases promulgated by this Court where Art. 36 of the Family Code was applied even though the marriage involved was celebrated prior to August 3, 1988. As painstakingly enumerated by Arthur in his Motion for Reconsideration[45] before the RTC:

22. In Chi Ming Tsoi vs. CA and Gina Lao-Tsoi, G.R. No. 119190, January 16, 1997, the Supreme Court sustained the JUDGMENT of the trial court declaring as VOID the marriage entered into by the plaintiff with the defendant on May 22, 1988, a date that falls BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988;

23. In Republic vs. CA and Roridel Olaviano Molina, G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997, the Supreme Court handed down the GUIDELINES in the interpretation and application of Article 36 of the Family Code, for the guidance of the bench and the bar;

24. The marriage of Reynaldo Molina to Roridel Olaviano Molina may have been ruled subsisting and valid, but the Supreme Court did not find any issue with regard to the application of Article 36 of the Family Code in the said case, notwithstanding the fact that Reynaldo and Roridel were married on April 14, 1985, a date that falls BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988;

25. It is not lost on PETITIONER that even the case of Marcos vs. Marcos cited by this Honorable Court in the assailed JUDGMENT involves a case in which the parties were married BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code, that is, the date of the marriage is September 6, 1982;

26. In fact, there is a plethora of cases that reached the Supreme Court, which cases raised the issue of PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY of either or both parties, concerning marriages solemnized BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988, among which are the following:

a) Camacho-Reyes vs. Ramon Reyes, G.R. No. 185286, August 18, 2010 (Date of marriage – December 5, 1976);

b) Valdes vs. RTC, Branch 102, Quezon City & Gomez-Valdes, G.R. No. 122749, July 31, 1996 (Date of marriage – January 5, 1971);

s) Republic vs. Quintero-Hamano, G.R. No. 149498, May 20, 2004 (Date of marriage – January 14, 1988);

t) Malcampo-Sin vs. Sin, G.R. No. 137590, March 26, 2001 (Date of marriage – January 4, 1987);

u) Dimayuga-Laurena vs. CA & Laurena, G.R. No. 159220, September 22, 2008 (Date of marriage – December 19, 1983); and

v) Salas, Jr. vs. Aguila, G.R. No. 202370, September 23, 2013 (Date of marriage – September 7, 1985).[46]

Further, the OSG also properly observed in its Comment that, “the ruling of the court a quo discriminates against married couples for no reason other than having had the misfortune of contracting their marriage earlier than 3 August 1998. There is no reason why it should be so, as all persons are prone to being afflicted by a psychological disorder that could cause a downright incapacity to perform the obligations of marriage. The question should not be when the party asking for dissolution got married, but whether such psychological incapacity in fact exists.”[47]

From the foregoing, the Court sees no reason why it should depart from its earlier rulings which recognized the applicability of Art. 36 even to those marriages celebrated prior the effectivity of the Family Code. Given this, the Court agrees with both petitioner and the OSG that the RTC erred when it held that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be nullified on the ground of psychological incapacity solely on the basis that the Family Code was not yet in effect then.

At this juncture, it must be recalled that the RTC actually found Arthur to be psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. It held that:

Thus, the result of the psychiatric evaluation of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario by Dr. Daisy L. Chua Daquilanea preponderantly establishes that the petitioner is afflicted with a dependent personality disorder, a psychological incapacity characterized by severity or gravity, juridical antecedence and incurability, which has made the petitioner incognitive of the essential marital obligations of marriage that require the spouses to live together, observe mutual love, respect and fidelity, and render mutual help and support (Art. 68, Family Code; Republic vs. Iyoy, 470 SCRA 508). It is then obvious that before and at the time the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario and the respondent Marlene E. Candelario contracted marriage on June 11, 1984, the said petitioner was already psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, and the same still subsists as it is incurable such that their marriage would be void under Article 36 of the Family Code.[48]

However, the jurisprudential development established in Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan-Andal)[49] leads this Court to re-examine the findings of the trial court.

In Tan-Andal, the Court abandoned previous jurisprudence on psychological incapacity and categorically upheld that it is “neither a mental incapacity nor a personal disorder that must be proven through expert opinion.”[50] Nevertheless, the Court added that proof must still be provided to show the durable or enduring aspects of a person’s personality, called “personality structure,” which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse’s personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations embedded in the Family Code.[51]

Further, the Court in Tan-Andal stated that these aspects of personality need not be given by an expert. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. What is important is that the plaintiff-spouse must prove his or her case with clear and convincing evidence, with the totality of evidence sufficient to support a finding of psychological incapacity.[52]

Be that as it may, the alleged psychological incapacity must still be shown to be grave, incurable, and juridically antecedent.[53] First, gravity still has to be established, if only to preclude spouses from invoking mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts as ground for nullity. Second, incurability should also be understood in the legal sense. So long as the couple’s respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable breakdown of the marriage, the psychological incapacity of a spouse or both spouses is deemed “incurable.” Third, juridical antecedence or the existence of the condition prior to the celebration of marriage, is a statutory requirement which must be proven by the spouse alleging psychological incapacity.[54]

Applying the foregoing in the instant case, the Court finds that no psychological incapacity exists on record to merit nullifying Arthur and Marlene’s marriage.

Here, Arthur presented the Psychiatric Report of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea who found that the former is suffering from Dependent Personality Disorder brought about by an overprotective upbringing which led him to have dependency, low self-esteem, and abandonment issues that affected his marriage with Marlene. To recall, such findings were based on the testimony of Arthur, Marlene, and three other informants who knew the couple.[55]

However, this Court cannot accept such evidence as sufficient given that it failed to establish the gravity, incurability, and juridical antecedence of Arthur’s alleged incapacity.

A reading of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s report reveals that her findings are lacking in data as to Arthur’s personality structure and how it incapacitates him to perform the essential marital obligations. Neither does it prove that Arthur’s psychological incapacity is due to a genuine psychic cause. While the report was detailed on how Arthur had a difficult upbringing, it failed to show that his condition made it practically impossible for him to comply with the ordinary duties required in marriage. It only offered a general assessment on the supposed effect of Arthur’s personality disorder to his marital union with Marlene.

Notably, the Psychiatric Report stated that Arthur “had no regrets in this marriage and exerted no effort to save it”[56] and that “during marriage, he carried with him the same attachment issues of his developmental years, imbibed as part of who he had become as a person.”[57] It further added that:

x x x In his marital life with her, he continued to grapple with self-doubts and low self-esteem, which were the core conflicts of an extremely dependent individual. When she left him to work abroad, he perceived this as loss or abandonment such that he could not cope with it because of his dependent personality disorder. He longed to have a constant dose of care and affection. Without her, he did not show consistent ability to assume responsibilities, like a simple work as a tricycle driver and farmer, to fend for his family and take care of their only daughter. He needed to always sustain attachment with another to prevent himself from feeling fearful of facing things on his own. Hence, he related with another woman. He brought this woman home and the respondent saw all these when she surprised him by an unannounced vacation. He failed to love, care, respect, render support and most of all, [show] fidelity to his spouse. She could not bear to remain connected with him who could not detach from other women and his vices. She did not want to continue the marital relationship with him and separated from him permanently. His dependent personality got in the way such that she opted to eventually separate from him.[58]

However, no other adequate explanation was provided to show that Arthur’s failure to assume his marital obligations was not because of his mere refusal, neglect, difficulty, or ill will. It is worthy to point out that Art. 36 of the Family Code contemplates downright incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations. It is not enough to prove that a spouse failed to meet his responsibilities and duties as a married person; the incapacity must be so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage.[59] Here, it can be gleaned that Arthur simply made no real effort to work on his marriage with Marlene.

From this, the Court finds that the requirement of gravity was not satisfied.

The Court also holds that the requirement of incurability was not sufficiently proven. Jurisprudence provides that in order for the said requisite to be met, there must be “an undeniable pattern of a persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse that must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.”[60] Unfortunately, the Court finds that Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment of Arthur is wanting in this respect. While it was shown that Arthur had an extramarital affair while Marlene was working abroad, there was not enough evidence provided to prove that his incapacity or condition was incurable. Similar to the requirement on gravity, the report only made a general evaluation on the incurability of Arthur’s condition by stating that, “it was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.”[61]

Lastly, the Court also finds that the requirement of juridical antecedence was not met. There was no sufficient evidence that Arthur’s alleged incapacity existed prior to his marriage to Marlene. While the Psychiatric Report cited the corroborative testimonies of Faustina, Cerina, and Rizalyn, the same do not indicate that they have known Arthur longer than such period of time as to have personal knowledge of his circumstances. It is not clear in the report that these persons had already been present in Arthur’s life before the latter contracted marriage to testify on his past experiences or environment while growing up that they have consistently observed which may have triggered his behavior towards Marlene.

It bears emphasis that irreconcilable differences, conflicting personalities, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, physical abuse, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity or perversion, and abandonment, by themselves, do not warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 of the Family Code. It must be stressed that an unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage.[62]

In sum, Arthur failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his personality disorder was one of psychological incapacity within the meaning of Art. 36 of the Family Code that would warrant the severance of Arthur and Marlene’s marital bonds. Failing in this regard, the Court must protect the sanctity of their marriage as mandated by the Constitution.

WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The March 6, 2015 Judgment and the December 7, 2015 Order of the Regional Trial Court of San Jose, Antique, Branch 11, in Civil Case No. 2013-01-3848 are AFFIRMED. The marriage between Arthur A. Candelario and Marlene E. Candelario is declared VALID and SUBSISTING.

SO ORDERED.

Gesmundo, C.J. (Chairperson), Zalameda, and Marquez, JJ., concur.
Rosario,* J., on leave.","Arthur and Marlene were married in a civil ceremony on June 11, 1984. Their marriage produced one child who was born on May 14, 1985. Hoping to provide a better life for her family, Marlene moved to Singapore to work as a domestic helper sometime in October 1987 and left her child under the care and custody of Arthur, who worked as a farmer.[5] While working in Singapore, Marlene sent her earnings to her family. However, Arthur took advantage of Marlene’s absence and frequently visited nightclubs where he later on met his present partner.[6]

Marlene heard about Arthur’s affair and decided to return to the Philippines in October 1989 without the latter’s knowledge. It was then when she discovered that Arthur and his new partner were already living together in their conjugal dwelling.[7] Because of this, Marlene separated from Arthur that same year. Meanwhile, Marlene took their child from the custody of Arthur and was eventually raised and cared for by Marlene’s sister and parents. For his part, Arthur continued to live with his partner and they had four children together.[8]

More than 20 years later, Arthur filed before the RTC a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, praying that his marriage with Marlene be declared void ab initio due to his psychological incapacity to comply with his essential marital obligations.[9]

Marlene was served with summons but failed to file a written answer. Consequently, the RTC ordered the provincial prosecutor to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether collusion existed between the parties. The investigation report negated the presence of collusion between Arthur and Marlene. At the scheduled pre-trial conference, Marlene was likewise absent, and subsequently, the RTC declared the pre-trial terminated and set the case for trial on the merits.[10]

During trial, Arthur testified on his own behalf. Additionally, Dr. Daisy L. Chua-Daquilanea (Dr. Chua-Daquilanea), a psychiatry practitioner for 20 years, also testified for Arthur by way of Judicial Affidavit, which she identified together with her Psychiatric Report.[11]

According to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea, she conducted a psychiatric evaluation of Arthur and Marlene based on a series of psychiatric interviews, mental status examinations, neurologic and physical examinations of the parties themselves and collateral data from the following persons: (a) Faustina Mendoza (Faustina), the owner of the land where Arthur worked; (b) Cerina Bardina (Cerina), a neighbor of the couple; and (c) Rizalyn Basilio (Rizalyn), the sister of Marlene. Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment revealed that Arthur was afflicted with Dependent Personality Disorder.[12] The Psychiatric Report stated that:

In view of the foregoing psychiatric evaluation, the petitioner is found to have a DEPENDENT PERSONALITY DISORDER. He was found to have an extreme pattern of dependency. This was due to low self-esteem and fear of abandonment from an overprotective parental figure. This psychological conflict affected his development such that this personality disorder was noted prior to the marriage and became more prominent during the marriage. It is found to be serious as he manifested with the full-blown signs and symptoms of this extreme dependency. It was the cause of his untoward behavior in marital life and made him incapable to do his marital obligations to love, care, respect, render support and fidelity to his spouse. It was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.

The respondent is not found to have any disorder as she was able to cope with the marital crisis and showed no deterioration in her functioning. She was rational in her decisions to improve the future of her child and of herself.

Therefore, the petition for nullity of marriage in this case is highly recommended based on the presence of a severe and irreversible personality disorder on the part of the petitioner.[13]

After his evidence were admitted by the trial court, Arthur rested his case. Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for resolution given that Marlene and the State opted not to present any evidence.[14]","The sole issue presented before this Court is whether the Family Code, particularly Art. 36 thereof, can be retroactively applied to marriages that took place before its effectivity on August 3, 1988, including that of Arthur and Marlene’s marriage, which was solemnized on June 11, 1984.","In its March 6, 2015 Judgment,[15] the RTC denied Arthur’s Petition for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:

IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the verified PETITION dated January 18, 2013 of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario is hereby DENIED for lack of merit and, to all intents and purposes, this case is hereby dismissed.

Let separate copies of this judgment be furnished to Atty. Jenalyn A. Traifalgar, Prosecutor Marilou Garachico-Fabila, the Office of the Solicitor General, the respondent Marlene E. Candelario and the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario.

SO ORDERED.[16]

The RTC gave credence to Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s psychiatric evaluation and found that Arthur’s psychological incapacity, which was characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, had been preponderantly established.[17] However, even if this were the case, the trial court ruled that his marriage to Marlene cannot be nullified or declared as void ab initio under Article 36 of the Family Code considering that the said Code only became effective on August 3, 1988, while Arthur and Marlene’s marriage was celebrated on June 11, 1984.[18]

Aggrieved, Arthur moved for reconsideration;[19] however, the same was denied through the trial court’s December 7, 2015 Order.[20]

Given the above, Arthur filed before this Court the present Petition for Review on Certiorari,[21] raising the lone assignment of error, viz.:

The [c]ourt a [quo] erred in finding that the Family Code of the Philippines, particularly Section [sic] Thirty-Six (36) thereof, providing Psychological Incapacity as a ground for declaration of nullity of marriage, has no retroactive effect.[22]

In a February 10, 2016 Resolution,[23] the Court resolved to implead the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in the instant case.[24] In compliance thereto, A11hur filed a Motion to Amend Petition and to Admit Amended Petition.[25]

Thereafter, in a March 14, 2016 Resolution,[26] the Court denied the Petition for “failure to sufficiently show that the trial court committed any reversible error in the challenged judgment and order as to warrant the exercise by this Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.”[27] It also stated that the Petition failed to comply with certain requirements under Rule 45 and other related provisions of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.[28]

Subsequently, Arthur filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated March 14, 2016.[29] Acting on such motion, the Court, in a July 25, 2016 Resolution,[30] required the respondents to file their respective comments thereon.[31]

In its Comment dated October 20, 2017,[32] the OSG disagreed with the RTC’s disquisition and opined that the latter erred in ruling that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be declared void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity on the part of petitioner, on the sole reason that their marriage was celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code.[33]

Meanwhile, after copies of the Resolutions were returned unserved, the Court issued a Resolution[34] on June 27, 2018 dispensing with the filing of Marlene’s Comment on Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration.

Consequently, on March 20, 2019, the Court granted Arthur’s Motion for Reconsideration and set aside its March 14, 2016 Resolution.[35] It then required the parties to file their Comment to the Petition, to which the OSG filed its Manifestation In Lieu of Comment,[36] stating that it is adopting its Comment dated October 20, 2017 as its Comment to the Petition for Review on Certiorari.[37] On the other hand, Marlene still failed to file her Comment.

Thus, the Court will now proceed to determine the merits of the Petition.

We deny the petition.
At the outset, it must be borne in mind that direct recourse to this Court from the decisions and final orders of the RTC may be taken where only questions of law are raised or involved. There is a question of law when the doubt arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, which does not call for the examination of the probative value of the evidence of the parties.[38] Here, the question on the retroactive application of the Family Code does not entail a review or evaluation of the evidence presented by Arthur at the trial court level. Verily, petitioner raised a pure question of law.

To recall, while the RTC found that Arthur’s Dependent Personality Disorder rendered him psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations, it nevertheless held that his marriage to Marlene, which was celebrated on June 11, 1984, cannot be dissolved on the ground of psychological incapacity because the Family Code did not yet exist during that time.[39] It held that the applicable law that was in effect during the celebration of their marriage was the Civil Code, which did not contain any provision similar to Art. 36 of the Family Code.[40]

The Court disagrees with the conclusion reached by the RTC.

The legal provisions that are pertinent to the case are Arts. 36, 39, and 256 of the Family Code, to wit:

Art. 36. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization.

Art. 39. The action or defense for the declaration of absolute nullity of a marriage shall not prescribe. (As amended by Executive Order 227 and Republic Act No. 8533; The phrase “However, in case of marriage celebrated before the effectivity of this Code and falling under Article 36, such action or defense shall prescribe in ten years after this Code shall have taken effect” has been deleted by Republic Act No. 8533 [Approved February 23, 1998]).

Art. 256. This Code shall have retroactive effect insofar as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights in accordance with the Civil Code or other laws.

A plain reading of the above provisions would reveal that the Family Code, including its concept of psychological incapacity as a ground to nullify marriage, shall be given retroactive effect, to the extent that no vested or acquired rights under relevant laws will be prejudiced or impaired. The amendment of Art. 39 would also show that an action for nullifying a marriage is imprescriptible, without any distinction as to whether the marriage was solemnized before or after the effectivity of the Family Code.

Otherwise stated, nowhere does it state that Art. 36 cannot be retroactively applied to marriages that were celebrated prior to the effectivity of the Family Code. Basic is the rule in statutory construction that where the law does not distinguish, the courts should not distinguish. Where the law is free from ambiguity, the court may not introduce exceptions or conditions where none is provided from considerations of convenience, public welfare, or for any laudable purpose; neither may it engraft into the law qualifications not contemplated.[41]

Moreover, it is worthy to point out that in Santos v. Court of Appeals,[42] this Court took the opportunity to discuss the import of psychological incapacity during the deliberations of the Family Code Revision Committee, to wit:

Justice Puno formulated the next Article as follows:

[Art.] 37. A marriage contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated, to comply with the essential obligations of marriage shall likewise be void from the beginning even if such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization.

Justice Caguioa suggested that “even if” be substituted with “although.” On the other hand, Prof. Bautista proposed that the clause “although such incapacity becomes manifest after its solemnization” be deleted since it may encourage one to create the manifestation of psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa pointed out that, as in other provisions, they cannot argue on the basis of abuse.

Judge Diy suggested that they also include mental and physical incapacities, which are lesser in degree than psychological incapacity. Justice Caguioa explained that mental and physical incapacities are vices of consent while psychological incapacity is not a species of vice of consent.

Dean Gupit read what Bishop Cruz said on the matter in the minutes of their February 9, 1984 meeting:

“On the third ground, Bishop Cruz indicated that the phrase ‘psychological or mental impotence” is an invention of some churchmen who are moralists but not canonists, that is why it is considered a weak phrase. He said that the Code of Canon Law would rather express it as ‘psychological or mental incapacity to discharge…”

Justice Caguioa remarked that they deleted the word ‘mental’ precisely to distinguish it from vice of consent. He explained that ‘psychological incapacity’ refers to lack of understanding of the essential obligations of marriage.

Justice Puno reminded the members that, at the last meeting, they have decided not to go into the classification of “psychological incapacity” because there was a lot of debate on it and that this is precisely the reason why they classified it as a special case.

At this point, Justice Puno remarked that, since there having been annulments of marriages arising from psychological incapacity, Civil Law should not reconcile with Canon Law because it is a new ground even under Canon Law.

Prof. Romero raised the question: With this common provision in Civil Law and in Canon Law, are they going to have a provision in the Family Code to the effect that marriages annulled or declared void by the church on the ground of psychological incapacity is automatically annulled in Civil Law? The other members replied negatively.

Justice Puno and Prof. Romero inquired if Article 37 should be retroactive or prospective in application.

Justice Diy opined that she was for its retroactivity because it is their answer to the problem of church annulments of marriages, which are still valid under the Civil Law. On the other hand, Justice Reyes and Justice Puno were concerned about the avalanche of cases.

Dean Gupit suggested that they put the issue to a vote, which the Committee approved.

The members voted as follows:

(1) Justice Reyes, Justice Puno and Prof. Romero were for prospectivity.
(2) Justice Caguioa, Judge Diy, Dean Gupit, Prof. Bautista and Director Eufemio were for retroactivity.
(3) Prof. Baviera abstained.

Justice Caguioa suggested that they put in the prescriptive period of ten years within which the action for declaration of nullity of the marriage should be filed in court. The Committee approved the suggestion.[43]

From the foregoing, it can be gleaned that the Family Code Revision Committee actually took into consideration and voted on the retroactive application of Art. 36. In this regard, even if Arthur and Marlene’s marriage took place before the effectivity of the Family Code, the same can be declared void on the ground of Arthur’s psychological incapacity, as long as no vested or acquired rights are disturbed.

On this score, it must be noted that the records are bereft of any indication that there were vested or acquired rights that were prejudiced or impaired in this case. As mentioned by Arthur in his Petition, “[d]uring their marriage, the spouses have not acquired real and personal properties of significant value.”[44] It bears emphasis that if Marlene had an actual vested or acquired right that would be prejudiced should the Family Code be given retroactive effect, she should have raised such matter at the first possible instance or at any given stage of the proceedings where she was required to file an answer or comment. However, this she did not do. For failure to avail herself of the several opportunities given to her, she is deemed to have waived her right to prove and testify on such matter.

Additionally, the petitioner also correctly pointed out that there have already been numerous cases promulgated by this Court where Art. 36 of the Family Code was applied even though the marriage involved was celebrated prior to August 3, 1988. As painstakingly enumerated by Arthur in his Motion for Reconsideration[45] before the RTC:

22. In Chi Ming Tsoi vs. CA and Gina Lao-Tsoi, G.R. No. 119190, January 16, 1997, the Supreme Court sustained the JUDGMENT of the trial court declaring as VOID the marriage entered into by the plaintiff with the defendant on May 22, 1988, a date that falls BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988;

23. In Republic vs. CA and Roridel Olaviano Molina, G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997, the Supreme Court handed down the GUIDELINES in the interpretation and application of Article 36 of the Family Code, for the guidance of the bench and the bar;

24. The marriage of Reynaldo Molina to Roridel Olaviano Molina may have been ruled subsisting and valid, but the Supreme Court did not find any issue with regard to the application of Article 36 of the Family Code in the said case, notwithstanding the fact that Reynaldo and Roridel were married on April 14, 1985, a date that falls BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988;

25. It is not lost on PETITIONER that even the case of Marcos vs. Marcos cited by this Honorable Court in the assailed JUDGMENT involves a case in which the parties were married BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code, that is, the date of the marriage is September 6, 1982;

26. In fact, there is a plethora of cases that reached the Supreme Court, which cases raised the issue of PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY of either or both parties, concerning marriages solemnized BEFORE the effectivity of the Family Code on August 3, 1988, among which are the following:

a) Camacho-Reyes vs. Ramon Reyes, G.R. No. 185286, August 18, 2010 (Date of marriage – December 5, 1976);

t) Malcampo-Sin vs. Sin, G.R. No. 137590, March 26, 2001 (Date of marriage – January 4, 1987);

u) Dimayuga-Laurena vs. CA & Laurena, G.R. No. 159220, September 22, 2008 (Date of marriage – December 19, 1983); and

v) Salas, Jr. vs. Aguila, G.R. No. 202370, September 23, 2013 (Date of marriage – September 7, 1985).[46]

Further, the OSG also properly observed in its Comment that, “the ruling of the court a quo discriminates against married couples for no reason other than having had the misfortune of contracting their marriage earlier than 3 August 1998. There is no reason why it should be so, as all persons are prone to being afflicted by a psychological disorder that could cause a downright incapacity to perform the obligations of marriage. The question should not be when the party asking for dissolution got married, but whether such psychological incapacity in fact exists.”[47]

From the foregoing, the Court sees no reason why it should depart from its earlier rulings which recognized the applicability of Art. 36 even to those marriages celebrated prior the effectivity of the Family Code. Given this, the Court agrees with both petitioner and the OSG that the RTC erred when it held that Arthur and Marlene’s marriage cannot be nullified on the ground of psychological incapacity solely on the basis that the Family Code was not yet in effect then.

At this juncture, it must be recalled that the RTC actually found Arthur to be psychologically incapacitated to comply with his essential marital obligations. It held that:

Thus, the result of the psychiatric evaluation of the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario by Dr. Daisy L. Chua Daquilanea preponderantly establishes that the petitioner is afflicted with a dependent personality disorder, a psychological incapacity characterized by severity or gravity, juridical antecedence and incurability, which has made the petitioner incognitive of the essential marital obligations of marriage that require the spouses to live together, observe mutual love, respect and fidelity, and render mutual help and support (Art. 68, Family Code; Republic vs. Iyoy, 470 SCRA 508). It is then obvious that before and at the time the petitioner Arthur A. Candelario and the respondent Marlene E. Candelario contracted marriage on June 11, 1984, the said petitioner was already psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, and the same still subsists as it is incurable such that their marriage would be void under Article 36 of the Family Code.[48]

However, the jurisprudential development established in Tan-Andal v. Andal (Tan-Andal)[49] leads this Court to re-examine the findings of the trial court.

In Tan-Andal, the Court abandoned previous jurisprudence on psychological incapacity and categorically upheld that it is “neither a mental incapacity nor a personal disorder that must be proven through expert opinion.”[50] Nevertheless, the Court added that proof must still be provided to show the durable or enduring aspects of a person’s personality, called “personality structure,” which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse’s personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations embedded in the Family Code.[51]

Further, the Court in Tan-Andal stated that these aspects of personality need not be given by an expert. Ordinary witnesses who have been present in the life of the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behaviors that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. What is important is that the plaintiff-spouse must prove his or her case with clear and convincing evidence, with the totality of evidence sufficient to support a finding of psychological incapacity.[52]

Be that as it may, the alleged psychological incapacity must still be shown to be grave, incurable, and juridically antecedent.[53] First, gravity still has to be established, if only to preclude spouses from invoking mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts as ground for nullity. Second, incurability should also be understood in the legal sense. So long as the couple’s respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result of the union would be the inevitable breakdown of the marriage, the psychological incapacity of a spouse or both spouses is deemed “incurable.” Third, juridical antecedence or the existence of the condition prior to the celebration of marriage, is a statutory requirement which must be proven by the spouse alleging psychological incapacity.[54]

Applying the foregoing in the instant case, the Court finds that no psychological incapacity exists on record to merit nullifying Arthur and Marlene’s marriage.

Here, Arthur presented the Psychiatric Report of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea who found that the former is suffering from Dependent Personality Disorder brought about by an overprotective upbringing which led him to have dependency, low self-esteem, and abandonment issues that affected his marriage with Marlene. To recall, such findings were based on the testimony of Arthur, Marlene, and three other informants who knew the couple.[55]

However, this Court cannot accept such evidence as sufficient given that it failed to establish the gravity, incurability, and juridical antecedence of Arthur’s alleged incapacity.

A reading of Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s report reveals that her findings are lacking in data as to Arthur’s personality structure and how it incapacitates him to perform the essential marital obligations. Neither does it prove that Arthur’s psychological incapacity is due to a genuine psychic cause. While the report was detailed on how Arthur had a difficult upbringing, it failed to show that his condition made it practically impossible for him to comply with the ordinary duties required in marriage. It only offered a general assessment on the supposed effect of Arthur’s personality disorder to his marital union with Marlene.

Notably, the Psychiatric Report stated that Arthur “had no regrets in this marriage and exerted no effort to save it”[56] and that “during marriage, he carried with him the same attachment issues of his developmental years, imbibed as part of who he had become as a person.”[57] It further added that:

x x x In his marital life with her, he continued to grapple with self-doubts and low self-esteem, which were the core conflicts of an extremely dependent individual. When she left him to work abroad, he perceived this as loss or abandonment such that he could not cope with it because of his dependent personality disorder. He longed to have a constant dose of care and affection. Without her, he did not show consistent ability to assume responsibilities, like a simple work as a tricycle driver and farmer, to fend for his family and take care of their only daughter. He needed to always sustain attachment with another to prevent himself from feeling fearful of facing things on his own. Hence, he related with another woman. He brought this woman home and the respondent saw all these when she surprised him by an unannounced vacation. He failed to love, care, respect, render support and most of all, [show] fidelity to his spouse. She could not bear to remain connected with him who could not detach from other women and his vices. She did not want to continue the marital relationship with him and separated from him permanently. His dependent personality got in the way such that she opted to eventually separate from him.[58]

However, no other adequate explanation was provided to show that Arthur’s failure to assume his marital obligations was not because of his mere refusal, neglect, difficulty, or ill will. It is worthy to point out that Art. 36 of the Family Code contemplates downright incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume the basic marital obligations. It is not enough to prove that a spouse failed to meet his responsibilities and duties as a married person; the incapacity must be so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, that the only result of the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage.[59] Here, it can be gleaned that Arthur simply made no real effort to work on his marriage with Marlene.

From this, the Court finds that the requirement of gravity was not satisfied.

The Court also holds that the requirement of incurability was not sufficiently proven. Jurisprudence provides that in order for the said requisite to be met, there must be “an undeniable pattern of a persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful, and supportive spouse that must be established so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.”[60] Unfortunately, the Court finds that Dr. Chua-Daquilanea’s assessment of Arthur is wanting in this respect. While it was shown that Arthur had an extramarital affair while Marlene was working abroad, there was not enough evidence provided to prove that his incapacity or condition was incurable. Similar to the requirement on gravity, the report only made a general evaluation on the incurability of Arthur’s condition by stating that, “it was not likely to respond to any treatment intervention as such behavior is acceptable to him and not bound to be modified in any way.”[61]

Lastly, the Court also finds that the requirement of juridical antecedence was not met. There was no sufficient evidence that Arthur’s alleged incapacity existed prior to his marriage to Marlene. While the Psychiatric Report cited the corroborative testimonies of Faustina, Cerina, and Rizalyn, the same do not indicate that they have known Arthur longer than such period of time as to have personal knowledge of his circumstances. It is not clear in the report that these persons had already been present in Arthur’s life before the latter contracted marriage to testify on his past experiences or environment while growing up that they have consistently observed which may have triggered his behavior towards Marlene.

It bears emphasis that irreconcilable differences, conflicting personalities, emotional immaturity and irresponsibility, physical abuse, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity or perversion, and abandonment, by themselves, do not warrant a finding of psychological incapacity under Art. 36 of the Family Code. It must be stressed that an unsatisfactory marriage is not a null and void marriage.[62]

In sum, Arthur failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his personality disorder was one of psychological incapacity within the meaning of Art. 36 of the Family Code that would warrant the severance of Arthur and Marlene’s marital bonds. Failing in this regard, the Court must protect the sanctity of their marriage as mandated by the Constitution.

WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The March 6, 2015 Judgment and the December 7, 2015 Order of the Regional Trial Court of San Jose, Antique, Branch 11, in Civil Case No. 2013-01-3848 are AFFIRMED. The marriage between Arthur A. Candelario and Marlene E. Candelario is declared VALID and SUBSISTING.

[ G.R. No. 245926. July 25, 2023 ]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N



GESMUNDO, C.J.:
The allegation in the information charging the accused of Qualified Rape under Article 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), should be precise as to the relationship between the offender and the victim. The allegation cannot be stated in the alternative by using the disjunctive term “or.”
The present Appeal[2] seeks to reverse and set aside the November 29, 2018 Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City (CA) in CA-­G.R. CR HC No. 01797-MIN, which affirmed the November 24, 2017 Decision[4] of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 19 (RTC), convicting XXX (accused-appellant) of Qualified Rape under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353,[5] otherwise known as “The Anti-Rape Law of 1997.”



The Information[6] dated July 23, 2015, charged accused-appellant with Qualified Rape, committed as follows:
Sometime on 24 February 2015 around midnight, at x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, knowing full[y] well the minority of his first cousin or relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity, through force and intimidation and through grave abuse of authority, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, feloniously insert his penis into the vagina of “AAA”, 16 [sic] years old, without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.

The qualifying aggravating circumstance enumerated in paragraph of Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code is attendant in the commission of the offense that is – the offended patty is below eighteen (18) years old and the offender is a relative within the third civil degree [of] consanguinity.

CONTRARY TO Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-8 of the Revised Penal Code.[7]

Accused-appellant was arraigned on October 22, 2015 wherein he entered a “not guilty” plea. During pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following: (1) identity of accused-appellant; (2) accused-appellant is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity of AAA; and (3) AAA was examined by a physician at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center based on a Medical Certificate with code M-OBG-W-2015-002-870172.[8] Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.

Version of the prosecution

The prosecution presented the following witnesses: AAA, private complainant; BBB, mother of AAA; and CCC, the younger brother of AAA.

AAA testified that she was living with her grandparents and her father, DDD, in x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental, when the rape incident occurred. She narrated that on February 24, 2015 at around 5:00 p.m., her cousin, accused-appellant, arrived at the house of her grandparents to charge his cellphone. He left the house after doing so.[9]

Accused-appellant returned around midnight and again asked if he could charge his cellphone. AAA, who was sleeping at the ground floor of the house, opened the door and allowed him to enter. She then went back to sleep. At that time, AAA’s father was not around because he was attending a  wake, while her grandparents were sleeping on the second floor.[10]

AAA was later awakened and surprised when she found accused-­appellant already lying beside her. He then proceeded to touch her breasts and other parts of her body, covered her mouth, and undressed her. She claimed that after accused-appellant took off his clothes, he inserted his penis into her vagina. She shivered in fear and wanted to shout, but accused-­appellant continued to over her mouth.[11] She alleged that accused-appellant threatened to kill her and her father if she would report or tell anybody what happened.[12] Accused-appellant then left while AAA cried out of fear, and felt pain in her vagina. Thereafter, AAA received a text message from accused­-appellant which reads: “AYAW PAG SABA MASKI KINSA! KUNG MAGSABA KA PATYON TA KA! UG ANG IMONG PAPA!” (Don’t report to anyone! If you do, I will kill you and your father!)[13]

CCC narrated that at around 10:00 a.m. on February 28, 2015, he received a text message from AAA saying that accused-appellant raped her. CCC then told their mother, BBB, who called and instructed AAA to go to her house in x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental.[14] AAA obliged. BBB then accompanied AAA to the local police station to report the matter. They were then advised to go to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center where AAA presented herself for medical examination.[15] The Medical Certificate[16] issued by the hospital indicated that AAA had an annular hymen with complete laceration at the 4 and 6 o’clock positions.

Version of the defense

 The defense presented two witnesses: accused-appellant and his sister, YYY.

Accused-appellant denied the allegations and testified that he was at the house of his cousin, WWW, in x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental, from 4:30 p.m. on February 24, 2015 until 4:30 a.m. the following day, to celebrate the birthday of WWW’s son.[17] He claimed that WWW fetched him from his residence in x x x xx x x xxxx using a motorcycle, and they drove 30 minutes to reach WWW’s house in x x x xx x x xxxx. WWW also brought him back to his house the following day. On cross-examination, accused-appellant confirmed that AAA is his cousin because his mother and AAA’s father are siblings.[18]

On the other hand, YYY testified that she was in WWW’s house in x x x xx x x xxxx on the night of February 24, 2014 to attend the birthday celebration of WWW’s son. She confirmed that accused-appellant attended the celebration and that it was WWW who brought him to the celebration.[19]



On November 24, 2017, the RTC rendered its Decision finding accused-appellant guilty of Qualified Rape beyond reasonable doubt, and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua in lieu of the death penalty, viz.:
ALL THE, FOREGOING CONSIDERED, the Court finds accused [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Rape as defined under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997), and for which he is imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua, in consonance with Republic Act No. 9346 which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.

[XXX] is further ordered to pay “AAA”

[P]100,000.00 as civil indemnity;
[P]100,000.00 as moral damages which the victim is assumed to have suffered and thus needs no proof[;] and
[P]100,000.00 as exemplary damages to set an example for the public good.
All damages awarded shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid.

IT IS SO ORDERED.[20]

The RTC held that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of Qualified Rape: (1) AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the one who forcibly had sex with her; (2) the relationship of accused-­appellant and AAA as within the third civil degree of consanguinity was stipulated by the parties; (3) based on the birth certificate of AAA, she was only 15 years old at the date of the incident.[21]

The trial court also rejected accused-appellant’s alibi, not only on account of AAA’s positive testimony, but also because it was not physically impossible for him to be in the place of the incident since the location of the birthday celebration was only 30 minutes away.[22]

Aggrieved by the ruling, accused-appellant timely filed a Notice of Appeal[23] which the RTC gave due course on December 4, 2017.[24]



In the now assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC that all the elements of Qualified Rape are present. It also held that AAA was only 15 years old at the time of the incident based on her birth certificate, and that there is no dispute that being her cousin, accused-appellant is her relative within the third degree of consanguinity, which was also stipulated by the parties.[25] The CA also affirmed the correctness of the award of damages which conformed with recent jurisprudence. Hence, the CA decreed:
ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated November 24, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Cagayan de Oro City in CR-FMY Criminal Case No. 2015-219 is AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.[26]

Dissatisfied by the decision, accused-appellant filed a Notice of Appeal,[27] which the CA gave due course.[28]



On July 17, 2019, the Court required both parties to file their respective supplemental briefs.[29] Both parties filed their respective Manifestations[30] stating that they are adopting the briefs they filed with the CA.
In his Appellant’s Brief,[31] accused-appellant submits that –

THE COURT [A QUO] GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE OFFENSES CHARGED NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.[32]

Based on this lone error, accused-appellant submits that: (1) the identity of the perpetrator is highly dubious; (2) the guilt of accused­-appellant was not proven beyond reasonable doubt; (3) AAA failed to meet the test of credibility; (4) the defense of alibi is a plausible excuse; and (5) the constitutional presumption of innocence was not overturned.[33]

Accused-appellant maintains that AAA’s identification of him as the perpetrator is unreliable. He points to AAA’s testimony wherein she narrated not having seen his face because there was no light, but only believed it was him because of his voice. AAA was also unable to present the supposed text message that she received from accused-appellant because she no longer had her cellphone. He further claims that AAA failed to identify him in open court.[34]

In addition, accused-appellant points out that the Information charged him of resorting to “force, threat, or intimidation and by means of grave abuse of authority”[35] in committing the crime of rape, however, AAA’s judicial affidavit proved otherwise. There was no indication that he uttered threatening words, or used force against AAA, or even exerted authority over her. He also maintains that the simple assertion made by AAA that he inserted his penis, without any other details, cannot establish carnal knowledge.[36] He doubts AAA’s actuations after the alleged rape incident as they appear to negate the occurrence of rape.[37]

On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) counters that all elements of the crime of Qualified Rape are present: (1) AAA was 15 years old when the rape occurred; (2) the parties stipulated that accused-­appellant is AAA’s cousin, or a relative within the third degree of consanguinity; (3) AAA had categorically asserted that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her against her will; and (4) AAA was asleep when accused-appellant started to ravish and force himself upon her, and even threatened her thereafter.[38]

The OSG further maintains that accused-appellant failed to prove that it was physically improbable for him to be at the place of the crime because WWW’s residence was only 30 minutes away from the house of AAA’s grandparents. Moreover, the testimony of his sister, YYY, cannot be accorded credence because it did not come from a disinterested witness.[39]

Aside from reiterating all his arguments in his Reply Brief,[40] accused-appellant additionally contends that although the parties stipulated on the medical certificate issued by the Northern Mindanao Medical Center, the same only pertained to the existence of the document, and not to the veracity of its contents.[41]

The lone issue for the Court to settle is whether the prosecution was able to establish accused-appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt for having committed the crime of Qualified Rape against AAA, a minor and a relative within the third degree of consanguinity.



Accused-appellant cannot be convicted of Qualified Rape, but only of Simple Rape under paragraph 1 of Art. 266-A of the RPC. 
 
The prosecution established the fact of rape.
 
Art. 266-A of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, defines rape as follows:

Article 266-A. Rape: When And How Committed. – Rape is committed:

1) By man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a)
Through force, threat, or intimidation;
b)
When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
c)
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
d)
When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
Hence, the elements necessary to commit the crime of rape are: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under 12 years of age.[42]

Carnal knowledge refers to the act of a man having sexual intercourse or sexual bodily connections with a woman.[43] It will not even matter if penetration lasted only for a short period of time since the slightest penetration of the female genitalia already consummates the crime of rape.[44]

The fairly recent case of People v. Agao[45] (Agao) further clarified:

x x x [T]he Court now reiterates, even as it clarifies, that rape of a female victim by male person through penile penetration reaches the consummated stage as soon as the penis penetrates the cleft of the [labia majora], also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, in even the slightest degree. Simply put, mere introduction, however slight, into the cleft of the [labia majora] by a penis that is capable of penetration, regardless of whether such penile penetration is thereafter fully achieved, consummates the crime of rape.

x x x x

x x x [T]he Court clarifies that when jurisprudence refers to “mere touching,” it is not sufficient that the penis grazed over the pudendum or the fleshy surface of the labia majora. Instead, what jurisprudence considers as consummated rape when it describes a penis touching the vagina is the penis penetrating the cleft of the [labia majora], however minimum or slight Similarly, a mere grazing by the penis of the fleshy portion, not the vulval cleft of the [labia majora], will also constitute only attempted rape and not consummated rape, since the same cannot be considered to have achieved the slightest level of penetration. Stated differently, the Court here elucidates that “mere touch” of the penis on the [labia majora] legally contemplates not mere surface touch or skin contact, but the slightest penetration of the vulval or pudendal cleft, however minimum in degree.

x x x x

Given the foregoing, for as long as the prosecutorial evidence is able to establish that the penis of the accused penetrated the vulval cleft or the cleft of the [labia majora] ([i.e.], the cleft of the fleshy outer lip of the victim’s vagina), however slight the introduction may be, the commission of rape already crossed the threshold of the attempted stage and into its consummation. On the factual appreciation of whether this minimum threshold genital contract is obtained in an allegation of rape, the same is rightly left to the trial court’s astute assessment from the entirety of the body of proof presented in each case.[46]

Aside from the above elements, the courts are likewise guided by the following principles in reviewing rape cases:

(1) [A]n accusation of rape, while easy to make, is difficult to prove and even harder for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) because rape, by its very nature, involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with greatest caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and must not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense; and (4) the complainant’s credibility assumes paramount importance because her testimony, if credible, is sufficient to support the conviction of the accused.[47]

Thus, the primordial consideration in rape cases is the credibility of the testimony of the victim because the accused may be convicted solely on such testament, provided that such is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.[48] Mindful of these guidelines, the Court rendered a judgment of acquittal in the cases of People v. Jampas[49] (Jampas) and People v. Ramirez, Jr.[50] (Ramirez). In both cases, the Court disbelieved the respective testimonies of therein complainants as they lacked details on how they were sexually abused by therein accused.

The Court, in Agao, further enjoined the courts to be circumspect in their appreciation of: whether rape was consummated through penile penetration, by taking into consideration attendant circumstances such as: “(i) when the victim testifies that she felt pain in her genitals; (ii) when there is bleeding in the same; (iii) when the labia minora was observed to be gaping or has redness or otherwise discolored; (iv) when the hymenal tags are no longer visible; or (v) when the sex organ of the victim has sustained any other type of injury.”[51]

In here, accused-appellant attaches his cause to the rulings in Jampas and Ramirez. He urges the Court to overturn his conviction because AAA’s simple claim that he inserted his penis into her vagina insufficiently establishes carnal knowledge. To his mind, AAA’s testimony was rendered incredible by the absence of any statement indicating that his penis was erect, or that he made a push and pull movement.[52]

The Court remains unpersuaded despite the rulings in Jampas and Ramirez mainly because the circumstances therein are not on all fours with the instant case.

In Jampas, the Court described the narration offered by therein private complainant as “simplistic” when she merely testified and mad a conclusion of law that therein accused had “successfully raped” her.[53] It bears noting that the accused in Jampas was acquitted not only because of this plain narration by therein private complainant, but also because her conduct after the incident defied human nature, and her description of where she was purportedly ravaged, appeared to be inexistent.

On the other hand, the testimony of the private complainant in Ramirez only mentioned that therein accused “used” her and that he “destroyed” her virginity.[54] She did not provide any other details of her molestation, and even failed to present proof of force or intimidation exerted upon her by therein accused.

In stark contrast, AAA was able to offer a straightforward testimony of how accused-appellant ravished her by laying down beside her, touching her breasts and other parts of her body, and inserting his penis into her private part while covering her mouth. She testified to feeling pain in her vagina after accused-appellant ravaged her. The medical certificate issued by the Northern Mindanao Medical Center corroborated her testimony, as it indicated that she had an annular or gaping hymen with complete laceration at the 4 and 6 o’clock positions. Verily, the courts a quo satisfied the guidelines in appreciating the testimony of AAA, a minor victim, as laid down in Agao. Moreover, when the testimony of the victim of her defilement is made in a straightforward and candid manner and supported by medical findings, the same will suffice to support the conviction of rape.[55]

The Court notes that accused-appellant challenges the veracity of the findings contained in the medical certificate on the ground that the physician was not presented as witness. However, it must be remembered that the medical examination on the victim and the medical certificate are merely corroborative in character and not essential elements of rape.[56] In the prosecution of rape cases, the material fact or circumstance is the occurrence of the rape.[57] Hence, the non-presentation of the physician who examined AAA and prepared the medical certificate is immaterial since the prosecution was able to establish the fact of rape through AAA’s testimony.

In another attempt to exonerate himself from the charge, accused­-appellant insists that the prosecution failed to show that he used force, threat, or intimidation against AAA.

Again, the Court is not convinced.

In establishing the presence of force, threat, or intimidation, the prosecution must show that voluntariness on the part of the victim during the sexual congress, is sorely lacking, and the accused employed force and intimidation upon the victim to achieve his end.[58] The Court explained:

In order to establish the element of force and intimidation, the prosecution must prove: a) a complete absence of voluntariness on the part of the victim; and b) that the accused actually employed force and intimidation upon the victim to achieve his end. In rape, force and intimidation must be viewed in the light of the victim’s perception and judgment at the time of the commission of the crime. Proof of resistance is not necessary; the victim has no burden to prove that she did all within her power to resist the force and intimidation employed upon her. It being enough that it is of such nature as to wield the victim to submit to the accused’s desires.

Intimidation includes the moral kind such as the fear caused when threatened with a knife or pistol, or when words employed are of such nature as would incite anxiety or distress leaving the victim without any choice but to surrender. As this Court held in Nacario v. People, “[i]ntimidation is a state of mind, which cannot, with [absolute] certainty, be discerned. Whether a person has been intimidated can only be inferred from the simultaneous or subsequent acts of the person subjected thereto.” It involves largely an appreciation of the state of mind of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime. Hence, rather than the appellate courts which relies only on the cold and mute pages of the records which do not graphically convey emotion, the assessment of the trial court must be given binding finality in this respect.[59] (Emphases supplied; citation omitted)

Force, as an element of rape, must be sufficient to accomplish the purposes which the accused had in mind.[60] On the other hand, intimidation results in fear, such that if the victim resists the lustful desire of the accused, something would happen to her at that moment or thereafter, by being threatened with death 1f she reports the incident.[61] Force or intimidation is relative, and does not rely on the use of a deadly weapon or exertion of physical violence. Such depends on the circumstances availing in the commission of rape, such as the size, age, strength, and relations of the parties. The force or intimidation employed may not be great to the extent of being irresistible, but must only be enough for the accused to achieve his purpose.[62]

The use of intimidation usually explains the absence of any sign of struggle, which would otherwise indicate that the victim fought or tried to fight off her attacker.[63] In People v. Bohol,[64] the Court went on to emphasize that the crime of rape pertains to the abuser’s exercise of power and control, and a deliberate process of intimidation to keep the victim in a state of fear and humiliation. In this manner, the victim may not exert any resistance despite the abuser being unarmed.[65]

For these reasons, the Court sustains the conclusion made by the CA that accused-appellant employed force and intimidation in satisfying his bestial desire. The mere act of covering AAA’s mouth to keep her from shouting for help while he sexually molested her, sufficiently indicated the use of force and intimidation by accused-appellant, thus:

[T]his Court finds that the evidence on record sufficiently established that accused-appellant employed force, intimidation and threat in carrying out his sexual advances against private complainant. The mere fact that private [complainant] wanted to shout for help but was unable to do so because accused-appellant covered her mouth is already a manifestation that accused-appellant actually forced himself against private complainant. Private complainant felt so helpless that she shivered with fear the whole time accused-appellant was raping her. Clearly, contrary to the accused-­appellant’s contention, the element of force and intimidation is present in this case.[66]

Finally, accused appellant casts doubt on AAA’s identification of him as the assailant. AAA testified that she did not see his face because of the darkness, but only recognized his voice. He likewise claims that AAA did not identify him in open court.

Again, the argument has no merit.

In People v. Sanay,[67] the Court emphasized that identifying the assailant based on familiarity may be deemed reliable, thus:

A victim who was sufficiently acquainted with their assailant due to a prior relationship or association, such as being “barriomates,” neighbors, or as the second husband of their grandmother, signifies a certain familiarity with the assailant’s physical features, which the victim may easily perceive at the time of the commission of the crime. Accordingly, even when the offense was committed under circumstances that make it difficult for the victim to ascertain the identity of the perpetrator, as in this case where AAA was raped at night, the identification of the accused is deemed credible when the victim is closely familiar with the assailant.[68]

It cannot be gainsaid that AAA is familiar with the voice of accused-appellant, especially when she had the chance to talk to him on two occasions that day. Notable also that there was no other person on the ground floor at that time aside from accused-appellant, since AAA’s grandparents were asleep on the second floor. Clearly, AAA had a clear perception that accused-appellant was her abuser, not only because of their relationship, but also on account of her interactions with him that transpired before her harrowing experience.

As regards the allegation that AAA failed to identify him in open court, the same was belied by the records, viz.:

DPP SUMALPONG:

Q: Do you know [XXX]?
A: Yes.

x x x x

Q: Did you see him inside the Court room today?
A: Yes.

Q: Where is he?
A: He is seated 3rd from the right side.[69]

In sum, accused-appellant failed to convince the Court that the prosecution was amiss in establishing that he had carnal knowledge of AAA by means of force and intimidation. There can be no doubt that accused-­appellant committed rape under Art. 266-A of the RPC.   
 

Accused-appellant may only be liable for Simple Rape.
 
Both the CA and the RTC held that the rape committed by accused-­appellant was qualified on account of AAA’s minority and his being a relative of AAA within the third civil degree consanguinity. On this account, the Court disagrees.

The crime of Qualified Rape is punishable under Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC which reads:

Article 266-B. Penalty. — x x x

x x x x

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:

1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common­-law spouse of the parent of the victim[.] (Emphasis supplied)

Art. 266-B(1) qualifies the crime of rape when it is committed by a relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree of a victim below the age of 18. Both qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship should be alleged in the information.[70]

As regards the circumstance of minority, the best evidence to prove the age of the offend d party is through a certificate of live birth[71] duly authenticated by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).[72]

In here, the prosecution submitted a PSA-certified copy of AAA’s Birth Certificate[73] which indicates her birthdate as June 4, 1999. Hence, on February 24, 2015 when the rape incident occurred, AAA was 15 years old, as correctly found by both the CA[74] and the RTC.[75] Hence, AAA was still a minor, below the age of 18, when she was sexually abused by accused­appellant.

However, minority alone will not qualify the rape under Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC, as it is required that the offender is a relative of the victim within the third degree, of consanguinity. Despite the finding of minority of AAA, the Court is not in agreement with the CA and the RTC in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of relationship.

It is a basic rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the entire case open for review, that even unassigned errors may be corrected if found in the appealed judgment.[76] The Court finds occasion here to apply this rule on account of the erroneous appreciation by the CA and the RTC of the qualifying circumstance of relationship.

Section 6,[77] in relation to Sec. 9,[78] Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that the information must be sufficient. In the event that a qualifying or aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime, Sec. 9 ordains that the same should be stated in ordinary and concise language, sufficient to inform the accused not only of the crime, but also the qualifying circumstances which attended its commission. The facts alleged in the body of the information, not the technical name given by the prosecutor appearing the title of the information, determine the character of the crime.[79]

On the other hand, the relationship cannot increase the crime to Qualified Rape if the information did not specifically allege the relationship. Otherwise, the accused would be deprived of his right to be informed of the nature of the charge against him.[80]

Relevant likewise in this case is the rule in statutory construction that the disjunctive word “or,” signifies “disassociation and independence of one thing from the other things enumerated,”[81] unless the context requires a different interpretation.[82] When “or” is used, the various members of the enumeration are to be taken separately.[83] Also, the word “or” is significant, in that it indicates an alternative and often connects a series of words or propositions indicating a choice of either.[84] Hence, as a general rule, the terms that come before and after the disjunctive word “or,” are different from each other, the intention being, is to provide an alternative option. The exception, however, is that based on the context of its usage, the terms may refer to the same thing or be similar in interpretation.

Regardless of whether the general rule or the exception is applied in determining the intention behind the use of “or” in the Information filed against accused-appellant, its effect on his right to be fully informed of the nature and cause of the charge against him, is the same.

To recall, the subject Information contains the allegation that AAA is a “first cousin or relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity”[85] of accused-appellant. Applying the general rule in statutory construction on the use of the word “or,” the terms “first cousin” and “relatives within the third civil degree of consanguinity” shall be accorded different, distinct, and separate meanings. This holds true considering that a first cousin is beyond the third degree of consanguinity, hence, “first cousin” and “third degree relative by consanguinity” refer to different relationships.

Relevant at this point, are Arts. 964 and 966 of the Civil Code, which read:

Art. 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.

x x x x

A collateral line is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants, but who come from a common ancestor.

x x x x

Art. 966. In the line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations or persons, excluding the progenitor.

x x x x

In the collateral line, ascent is made to the common ancestor and then descent is made to the person with whom the computation is to be made. Thus, a person is two degrees removed from his brother, three from his uncle, who is the brother of his father, four from his first cousin and so forth. (Emphasis supplied)

Accordingly, first cousins are not relatives within the third degree of consanguinity; they are fourth degree relatives[86] as they are four degrees removed from one another.

The use of the word “or” in the Information allowed the prosecution an opportunity to indict accused-appellant in the alternative, either as a first cousin or a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity. This cannot be permitted as it did not sufficiently apprise accused-appellant of his precise liability in committing the offense. It must be remembered that the simultaneous presence of the circumstances of minority and relationship elevates the offense of Simple Rape to Qualified Rape, thereby increasing the penalty of Simple Rape from reclusion perpetua to death. It is for this reason that Sec. 9, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure requires precision and particularity in stating the qualifying circumstances availing in the commission of the offense. The Information should be precise as to the relationship between the offender and the victim, such that the averment cannot be stated in the alternative. More so in this case where being a first cousin will not elevate the crime to Qualified Rape which merits a heavier penalty.

Neither will the Court allow an interpretation of the phrase “first cousins” to mean “relatives within the third degree of consanguinity” based on how the word “or” was used in the Information and made the subject of stipulation.

The Court has observed that the penultimate paragraph of the Information specifically alleged that the circumstance of minority and being a relative within the third degree of consanguinity are attendant in the commission of the crime. Taken together with the preceding paragraph which contained the word “or,” the prosecution intended the relationship of “first cousin” to be the same as, and included in the term, “relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity.” As previously explained, this is patently an erroneous averment: a first cousin is a relative of the fourth degree of consanguinity, hence, beyond the third degree.

A careful scrutiny of the allegation in the Information would reveal that it was couched imprecisely, thereby resulting in two inferences: (1) that AAA may either be a first cousin or a relative of accused-appellant within the third civil degree of consanguinity; or (2) that AAA, being a first cousin, is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity. Indubitably, the phrasing of the allegation results in confusion which may not be fully understood by a person of ordinary intelligence such as accused-appellant. As such, accused-appellant was not fully apprised that the charge of rape against him was made serious by the phrase “relative within the third degree of consanguinity,” knowing only that he is merely a first cousin of AAA, which should only make him accountable for Simple Rape.

With the imprecision in accusing herein accused-appellant for Qualified Rape under Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC, he cannot be held liable for the same. Since carnal knowledge of AAA by means of force, threat, or intimidation had been established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant may only be liable for Simple Rape.

The Court is not oblivious to the rule enunciated in People v. Solar[87] (Solar) that the insufficiency or defect in the information may be waived by the accused, and that the appellate court shall decide the appeal depending on whether the accuse has already made such waiver. However, the Court will deviate from applying Solar.

The rule is settled that the negligence and mistakes of counsel shall bind the client. This however admits of an exception: when such negligence is so gross, reckless, and inexcusable which essentially deprives the clients with their day in court,[88] or when such mistakes would result in serious injustice.[89] Gross negligence must be nothing short of clear abandonment of the client’s cause,[90] and involves a thoughtless disregard of consequences without any effort to avoid them.[91] In Ong Lay Hin v. Court of Appeals[92] (Ong Lay Hin), the Court emphasized that to be appreciated as an exception, the gross negligence of counsel should border on recklessness and utter incompetence, to the extent that the accused was deprived of the right to due process, thus:

But, there is an exception to this doctrine of binding agency between counsel and client. This is when the negligence of counsel is so gross, almost bordering on recklessness and utter incompetence, that we can safely conclude that the due process rights of the client were violated. Even so, there must be a clear and convincing showing that the client was so maliciously deprived of information that he or she could not have acted to protect his or her interests. The error of counsel must have been both palpable yet maliciously exercised that it should viably be the basis for disciplinary action.[93]

Ong Lay Hin further explains that the nature of the relationship between a counsel and a client is highly fiduciary, owing to the expectation by the latter, that the counsel understands the law and has a thorough grasp of the facts from which he or she chooses as relevant to advance the legal cause of action or defense to be pursued[94] on behalf of the client.

As such, when counsels affix their signatures on a stipulation of facts pursuant to Sec. 1, Rule 118 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, they admit, on behalf of their clients, all the facts stated therein, including all changes made thereon.[95] It must be remembered that a stipulation of facts is a judicial admission of all the facts stated therein.[96] Pertinently, Sec. 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:

Section 4. Judicial admissions. – An admission, verbal or written, made by the party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.

Indeed, a stipulation of facts by the counsel binds the client, unless (1) the admission was made through palpable mistake, or (2) no such admission was made.[97]

In here, the waiver by accused-appellant of the defect in the Information was made manifest during pre-trial. In the same proceeding, his counsel from the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) agreed to the offer of stipulation by AAA’s counsel that accused-appellant is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity.[98] This admission was made despite AAA’s and BBB’s statements in their respective Affidavits[99] both dated March 4, 2015, that accused-appellant is AAA’s “ig-agaw” (cousin).[100] Notable also that the Resolution (On Preliminary Investigation)[101] which served as basis in the filing of the Information against accused-appellant, also referred to accused-appellant as AAA’s first cousin.[102]

Hence, it was gross and palpable mistake on the part of accused-appellant’s counsel to admit that AAA is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity, despite the documents and the Information referring to accused-appellant only as a first cousin. Surely, We cannot attribute the fault to accused-appellant considering that the determination of relationship by civil degree, involves an application and understanding of the law, particularly the Civil Code. Needless to state, that the rule being considered here – the determination of the relationship by civil degree – is basic which every lawyer ought to know. As such, the admission by accused-­appellant’s counsel during pre-trial cannot be admitted, it being made through palpable mistake, bordering on recklessness and utter incompetence.

In view thereof, it was erroneous for the RTC to admit the subject stipulation despite being grossly incorrect. Quite appalling, that the RTC even mentioned in its Decision that accused-appellant is liable for Qualified Rape on the basis of the stipulation despite being aware of the true relationship between AAA and accused-appellant:

As it is, the fact that accused [XXX] is a cousin and a relative of AAA relative [sic] within third civil degree of consanguinity of the private complainant is a stipulated fact.[103]

In a similar manner, the CA also held that “being the cousin of private complainant,” accused-appellant is a “relative by third degree of consanguinity.”[104] Ever the OSG opined that relationship was present as “it was stipulated by both parties that appellant is the cousin or a relative by consanguinity within third civil degree of AAA.”[105]

At this juncture, the Court stresses that while parties are allowed to stipulate facts under Sec. 1, Rule 118 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, they cannot stipulate on erroneous application of the law, especially when all the facts are available for their consideration. Pertinently, the prosecutors should be mindful of their duty under the newly promulgated Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA),[106] that their primary duty is not to convict, but to see that justice is done.[107] Their overzealousness in prosecuting an accused will never justify a trampling of their constitutionally protected right to be fully informed of the nature and cause of the crime being charged.

On the part of the counsels of the accused, especially those coming from the PAO, they should constantly be aware of their fiduciary duty to be competent and diligent in representing their clients. Canon IV of the CPRA, as well as Secs. 1 and 4 thereof, enunciate that:

CANON IV
COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE

A lawyer professionally handling a client’s cause shall, to the best of his or her ability, observe competence, diligence, commitment, and skill consistent with the fiduciary nature of the lawyer-client relationship, regardless of the nature of the legal matter or issues involved, and whether for a fee or pro bono.
Section 1. Competent, efficient and conscientious service. — A lawyer shall provide legal service that is competent, efficient, and conscientious. A lawyer shall be thorough in research, preparation, and application of the legal knowledge and skills necessary for an engagement.

x x x x

Section 4. Diligence in all undertakings. — A lawyer shall observe diligence in all professional undertakings, and shall not cause or occasion delay in any legal matter before any court, tribunal, or other agency.

A lawyer shall appear for trial adequately familiar with the law, the facts of the case, and the evidence to be presented. A lawyer shall also be ready with the object and documentary evidence, as well as the judicial affidavits of the witnesses, when required by the rules or the court.

Finally, there is also a need to remind the members of the bench that although generally, they cannot stipulate for the parties, they can do so when the same contravenes law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.[108] Conversely, if there are indications that the stipulations are contrary to law, courts may intervene and strike down the same.

Proper penalty

In view of the patent and grave error in appreciating the circumstance of relationship, the conviction of accused-appellant for Qualified Rape should be modified. Since the prosecution has established carnal knowledge and the employment of force, threat, and intimidation upon AAA, accused-appellant may only be liable for Simple Rape.

With the downgrading of the crime for which accused-appellant is liable, the penalty imposed against him should be amended. Although the penalty imposed by the RTC, which the CA affirmed, is that of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole, the same was imposed in view of R.A. No. 9346[109] which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty. Hence, the same should be modified that the penalty to be imposed against accused-­appellant is reclusion perpetua pursuant to Art. 266-B of the RPC.

Correspondingly, the civil damages awarded to AAA are hereby corrected pursuant to People v. Jugueta:[110] P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. These amounts shall be subject to 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision, until full payment is made.

WHEREFORE, the appeal is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The November 29, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 01797-MIN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Court finds accused-appellant XXX GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape under Article 266-A(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code, and he is SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is ORDERED to PAY private complainant AAA the following amounts: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P75,000.100 as exemplary damages. He is further ORDERED to PAY interest upon the said amounts, at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.

Hernando, Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","The Information[6] dated July 23, 2015, charged accused-appellant with Qualified Rape, committed as follows:
Sometime on 24 February 2015 around midnight, at x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, knowing full[y] well the minority of his first cousin or relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity, through force and intimidation and through grave abuse of authority, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, feloniously insert his penis into the vagina of “AAA”, 16 [sic] years old, without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.

The qualifying aggravating circumstance enumerated in paragraph of Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code is attendant in the commission of the offense that is – the offended patty is below eighteen (18) years old and the offender is a relative within the third civil degree [of] consanguinity.

CONTRARY TO Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-8 of the Revised Penal Code.[7]

Accused-appellant was arraigned on October 22, 2015 wherein he entered a “not guilty” plea. During pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following: (1) identity of accused-appellant; (2) accused-appellant is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity of AAA; and (3) AAA was examined by a physician at the Northern Mindanao Medical Center based on a Medical Certificate with code M-OBG-W-2015-002-870172.[8] Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.

Version of the prosecution

The prosecution presented the following witnesses: AAA, private complainant; BBB, mother of AAA; and CCC, the younger brother of AAA.

AAA testified that she was living with her grandparents and her father, DDD, in x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental, when the rape incident occurred. She narrated that on February 24, 2015 at around 5:00 p.m., her cousin, accused-appellant, arrived at the house of her grandparents to charge his cellphone. He left the house after doing so.[9]

Accused-appellant returned around midnight and again asked if he could charge his cellphone. AAA, who was sleeping at the ground floor of the house, opened the door and allowed him to enter. She then went back to sleep. At that time, AAA’s father was not around because he was attending a  wake, while her grandparents were sleeping on the second floor.[10]

AAA was later awakened and surprised when she found accused-­appellant already lying beside her. He then proceeded to touch her breasts and other parts of her body, covered her mouth, and undressed her. She claimed that after accused-appellant took off his clothes, he inserted his penis into her vagina. She shivered in fear and wanted to shout, but accused-­appellant continued to over her mouth.[11] She alleged that accused-appellant threatened to kill her and her father if she would report or tell anybody what happened.[12] Accused-appellant then left while AAA cried out of fear, and felt pain in her vagina. Thereafter, AAA received a text message from accused­-appellant which reads: “AYAW PAG SABA MASKI KINSA! KUNG MAGSABA KA PATYON TA KA! UG ANG IMONG PAPA!” (Don’t report to anyone! If you do, I will kill you and your father!)[13]

CCC narrated that at around 10:00 a.m. on February 28, 2015, he received a text message from AAA saying that accused-appellant raped her. CCC then told their mother, BBB, who called and instructed AAA to go to her house in x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental.[14] AAA obliged. BBB then accompanied AAA to the local police station to report the matter. They were then advised to go to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center where AAA presented herself for medical examination.[15] The Medical Certificate[16] issued by the hospital indicated that AAA had an annular hymen with complete laceration at the 4 and 6 o’clock positions.

Version of the defense

 The defense presented two witnesses: accused-appellant and his sister, YYY.

Accused-appellant denied the allegations and testified that he was at the house of his cousin, WWW, in x x x xx x x xxxx, Misamis Oriental, from 4:30 p.m. on February 24, 2015 until 4:30 a.m. the following day, to celebrate the birthday of WWW’s son.[17] He claimed that WWW fetched him from his residence in x x x xx x x xxxx using a motorcycle, and they drove 30 minutes to reach WWW’s house in x x x xx x x xxxx. WWW also brought him back to his house the following day. On cross-examination, accused-appellant confirmed that AAA is his cousin because his mother and AAA’s father are siblings.[18]

On the other hand, YYY testified that she was in WWW’s house in x x x xx x x xxxx on the night of February 24, 2014 to attend the birthday celebration of WWW’s son. She confirmed that accused-appellant attended the celebration and that it was WWW who brought him to the celebration.[19]","On July 17, 2019, the Court required both parties to file their respective supplemental briefs.[29] Both parties filed their respective Manifestations[30] stating that they are adopting the briefs they filed with the CA.
In his Appellant’s Brief,[31] accused-appellant submits that –

THE COURT [A QUO] GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE OFFENSES CHARGED NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.[32]

Based on this lone error, accused-appellant submits that: (1) the identity of the perpetrator is highly dubious; (2) the guilt of accused­-appellant was not proven beyond reasonable doubt; (3) AAA failed to meet the test of credibility; (4) the defense of alibi is a plausible excuse; and (5) the constitutional presumption of innocence was not overturned.[33]

Accused-appellant maintains that AAA’s identification of him as the perpetrator is unreliable. He points to AAA’s testimony wherein she narrated not having seen his face because there was no light, but only believed it was him because of his voice. AAA was also unable to present the supposed text message that she received from accused-appellant because she no longer had her cellphone. He further claims that AAA failed to identify him in open court.[34]

In addition, accused-appellant points out that the Information charged him of resorting to “force, threat, or intimidation and by means of grave abuse of authority”[35] in committing the crime of rape, however, AAA’s judicial affidavit proved otherwise. There was no indication that he uttered threatening words, or used force against AAA, or even exerted authority over her. He also maintains that the simple assertion made by AAA that he inserted his penis, without any other details, cannot establish carnal knowledge.[36] He doubts AAA’s actuations after the alleged rape incident as they appear to negate the occurrence of rape.[37]

On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) counters that all elements of the crime of Qualified Rape are present: (1) AAA was 15 years old when the rape occurred; (2) the parties stipulated that accused-­appellant is AAA’s cousin, or a relative within the third degree of consanguinity; (3) AAA had categorically asserted that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her against her will; and (4) AAA was asleep when accused-appellant started to ravish and force himself upon her, and even threatened her thereafter.[38]

The OSG further maintains that accused-appellant failed to prove that it was physically improbable for him to be at the place of the crime because WWW’s residence was only 30 minutes away from the house of AAA’s grandparents. Moreover, the testimony of his sister, YYY, cannot be accorded credence because it did not come from a disinterested witness.[39]

Aside from reiterating all his arguments in his Reply Brief,[40] accused-appellant additionally contends that although the parties stipulated on the medical certificate issued by the Northern Mindanao Medical Center, the same only pertained to the existence of the document, and not to the veracity of its contents.[41]

The lone issue for the Court to settle is whether the prosecution was able to establish accused-appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt for having committed the crime of Qualified Rape against AAA, a minor and a relative within the third degree of consanguinity.","On November 24, 2017, the RTC rendered its Decision finding accused-appellant guilty of Qualified Rape beyond reasonable doubt, and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua in lieu of the death penalty, viz.:
ALL THE, FOREGOING CONSIDERED, the Court finds accused [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Rape as defined under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997), and for which he is imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua, in consonance with Republic Act No. 9346 which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.

[XXX] is further ordered to pay “AAA”

[P]100,000.00 as civil indemnity;
[P]100,000.00 as moral damages which the victim is assumed to have suffered and thus needs no proof[;] and
[P]100,000.00 as exemplary damages to set an example for the public good.
All damages awarded shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid.

IT IS SO ORDERED.[20]

The RTC held that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of Qualified Rape: (1) AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the one who forcibly had sex with her; (2) the relationship of accused-­appellant and AAA as within the third civil degree of consanguinity was stipulated by the parties; (3) based on the birth certificate of AAA, she was only 15 years old at the date of the incident.[21]

The trial court also rejected accused-appellant’s alibi, not only on account of AAA’s positive testimony, but also because it was not physically impossible for him to be in the place of the incident since the location of the birthday celebration was only 30 minutes away.[22]

Aggrieved by the ruling, accused-appellant timely filed a Notice of Appeal[23] which the RTC gave due course on December 4, 2017.[24]

In the now assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC that all the elements of Qualified Rape are present. It also held that AAA was only 15 years old at the time of the incident based on her birth certificate, and that there is no dispute that being her cousin, accused-appellant is her relative within the third degree of consanguinity, which was also stipulated by the parties.[25] The CA also affirmed the correctness of the award of damages which conformed with recent jurisprudence. Hence, the CA decreed:
ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated November 24, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Cagayan de Oro City in CR-FMY Criminal Case No. 2015-219 is AFFIRMED in toto.

SO ORDERED.[26]

Dissatisfied by the decision, accused-appellant filed a Notice of Appeal,[27] which the CA gave due course.[28]

Accused-appellant cannot be convicted of Qualified Rape, but only of Simple Rape under paragraph 1 of Art. 266-A of the RPC. 
 
The prosecution established the fact of rape.
 
Art. 266-A of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, defines rape as follows:

Article 266-A. Rape: When And How Committed. – Rape is committed:

1) By man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:

a)
Through force, threat, or intimidation;
b)
When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
c)
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
d)
When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
Hence, the elements necessary to commit the crime of rape are: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under 12 years of age.[42]

Carnal knowledge refers to the act of a man having sexual intercourse or sexual bodily connections with a woman.[43] It will not even matter if penetration lasted only for a short period of time since the slightest penetration of the female genitalia already consummates the crime of rape.[44]

The fairly recent case of People v. Agao[45] (Agao) further clarified:

x x x [T]he Court now reiterates, even as it clarifies, that rape of a female victim by male person through penile penetration reaches the consummated stage as soon as the penis penetrates the cleft of the [labia majora], also known as the vulval or pudendal cleft, or the fleshy outer lip of the vulva, in even the slightest degree. Simply put, mere introduction, however slight, into the cleft of the [labia majora] by a penis that is capable of penetration, regardless of whether such penile penetration is thereafter fully achieved, consummates the crime of rape.

x x x x

x x x [T]he Court clarifies that when jurisprudence refers to “mere touching,” it is not sufficient that the penis grazed over the pudendum or the fleshy surface of the labia majora. Instead, what jurisprudence considers as consummated rape when it describes a penis touching the vagina is the penis penetrating the cleft of the [labia majora], however minimum or slight Similarly, a mere grazing by the penis of the fleshy portion, not the vulval cleft of the [labia majora], will also constitute only attempted rape and not consummated rape, since the same cannot be considered to have achieved the slightest level of penetration. Stated differently, the Court here elucidates that “mere touch” of the penis on the [labia majora] legally contemplates not mere surface touch or skin contact, but the slightest penetration of the vulval or pudendal cleft, however minimum in degree.

x x x x

Given the foregoing, for as long as the prosecutorial evidence is able to establish that the penis of the accused penetrated the vulval cleft or the cleft of the [labia majora] ([i.e.], the cleft of the fleshy outer lip of the victim’s vagina), however slight the introduction may be, the commission of rape already crossed the threshold of the attempted stage and into its consummation. On the factual appreciation of whether this minimum threshold genital contract is obtained in an allegation of rape, the same is rightly left to the trial court’s astute assessment from the entirety of the body of proof presented in each case.[46]

Aside from the above elements, the courts are likewise guided by the following principles in reviewing rape cases:

(1) [A]n accusation of rape, while easy to make, is difficult to prove and even harder for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) because rape, by its very nature, involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with greatest caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and must not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense; and (4) the complainant’s credibility assumes paramount importance because her testimony, if credible, is sufficient to support the conviction of the accused.[47]

Thus, the primordial consideration in rape cases is the credibility of the testimony of the victim because the accused may be convicted solely on such testament, provided that such is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.[48] Mindful of these guidelines, the Court rendered a judgment of acquittal in the cases of People v. Jampas[49] (Jampas) and People v. Ramirez, Jr.[50] (Ramirez). In both cases, the Court disbelieved the respective testimonies of therein complainants as they lacked details on how they were sexually abused by therein accused.

The Court, in Agao, further enjoined the courts to be circumspect in their appreciation of: whether rape was consummated through penile penetration, by taking into consideration attendant circumstances such as: “(i) when the victim testifies that she felt pain in her genitals; (ii) when there is bleeding in the same; (iii) when the labia minora was observed to be gaping or has redness or otherwise discolored; (iv) when the hymenal tags are no longer visible; or (v) when the sex organ of the victim has sustained any other type of injury.”[51]

In here, accused-appellant attaches his cause to the rulings in Jampas and Ramirez. He urges the Court to overturn his conviction because AAA’s simple claim that he inserted his penis into her vagina insufficiently establishes carnal knowledge. To his mind, AAA’s testimony was rendered incredible by the absence of any statement indicating that his penis was erect, or that he made a push and pull movement.[52]

The Court remains unpersuaded despite the rulings in Jampas and Ramirez mainly because the circumstances therein are not on all fours with the instant case.

In Jampas, the Court described the narration offered by therein private complainant as “simplistic” when she merely testified and mad a conclusion of law that therein accused had “successfully raped” her.[53] It bears noting that the accused in Jampas was acquitted not only because of this plain narration by therein private complainant, but also because her conduct after the incident defied human nature, and her description of where she was purportedly ravaged, appeared to be inexistent.

On the other hand, the testimony of the private complainant in Ramirez only mentioned that therein accused “used” her and that he “destroyed” her virginity.[54] She did not provide any other details of her molestation, and even failed to present proof of force or intimidation exerted upon her by therein accused.

In stark contrast, AAA was able to offer a straightforward testimony of how accused-appellant ravished her by laying down beside her, touching her breasts and other parts of her body, and inserting his penis into her private part while covering her mouth. She testified to feeling pain in her vagina after accused-appellant ravaged her. The medical certificate issued by the Northern Mindanao Medical Center corroborated her testimony, as it indicated that she had an annular or gaping hymen with complete laceration at the 4 and 6 o’clock positions. Verily, the courts a quo satisfied the guidelines in appreciating the testimony of AAA, a minor victim, as laid down in Agao. Moreover, when the testimony of the victim of her defilement is made in a straightforward and candid manner and supported by medical findings, the same will suffice to support the conviction of rape.[55]

The Court notes that accused-appellant challenges the veracity of the findings contained in the medical certificate on the ground that the physician was not presented as witness. However, it must be remembered that the medical examination on the victim and the medical certificate are merely corroborative in character and not essential elements of rape.[56] In the prosecution of rape cases, the material fact or circumstance is the occurrence of the rape.[57] Hence, the non-presentation of the physician who examined AAA and prepared the medical certificate is immaterial since the prosecution was able to establish the fact of rape through AAA’s testimony.

In another attempt to exonerate himself from the charge, accused­-appellant insists that the prosecution failed to show that he used force, threat, or intimidation against AAA.

Again, the Court is not convinced.

In establishing the presence of force, threat, or intimidation, the prosecution must show that voluntariness on the part of the victim during the sexual congress, is sorely lacking, and the accused employed force and intimidation upon the victim to achieve his end.[58] The Court explained:

In order to establish the element of force and intimidation, the prosecution must prove: a) a complete absence of voluntariness on the part of the victim; and b) that the accused actually employed force and intimidation upon the victim to achieve his end. In rape, force and intimidation must be viewed in the light of the victim’s perception and judgment at the time of the commission of the crime. Proof of resistance is not necessary; the victim has no burden to prove that she did all within her power to resist the force and intimidation employed upon her. It being enough that it is of such nature as to wield the victim to submit to the accused’s desires.

Intimidation includes the moral kind such as the fear caused when threatened with a knife or pistol, or when words employed are of such nature as would incite anxiety or distress leaving the victim without any choice but to surrender. As this Court held in Nacario v. People, “[i]ntimidation is a state of mind, which cannot, with [absolute] certainty, be discerned. Whether a person has been intimidated can only be inferred from the simultaneous or subsequent acts of the person subjected thereto.” It involves largely an appreciation of the state of mind of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime. Hence, rather than the appellate courts which relies only on the cold and mute pages of the records which do not graphically convey emotion, the assessment of the trial court must be given binding finality in this respect.[59] (Emphases supplied; citation omitted)

Force, as an element of rape, must be sufficient to accomplish the purposes which the accused had in mind.[60] On the other hand, intimidation results in fear, such that if the victim resists the lustful desire of the accused, something would happen to her at that moment or thereafter, by being threatened with death 1f she reports the incident.[61] Force or intimidation is relative, and does not rely on the use of a deadly weapon or exertion of physical violence. Such depends on the circumstances availing in the commission of rape, such as the size, age, strength, and relations of the parties. The force or intimidation employed may not be great to the extent of being irresistible, but must only be enough for the accused to achieve his purpose.[62]

The use of intimidation usually explains the absence of any sign of struggle, which would otherwise indicate that the victim fought or tried to fight off her attacker.[63] In People v. Bohol,[64] the Court went on to emphasize that the crime of rape pertains to the abuser’s exercise of power and control, and a deliberate process of intimidation to keep the victim in a state of fear and humiliation. In this manner, the victim may not exert any resistance despite the abuser being unarmed.[65]

For these reasons, the Court sustains the conclusion made by the CA that accused-appellant employed force and intimidation in satisfying his bestial desire. The mere act of covering AAA’s mouth to keep her from shouting for help while he sexually molested her, sufficiently indicated the use of force and intimidation by accused-appellant, thus:

[T]his Court finds that the evidence on record sufficiently established that accused-appellant employed force, intimidation and threat in carrying out his sexual advances against private complainant. The mere fact that private [complainant] wanted to shout for help but was unable to do so because accused-appellant covered her mouth is already a manifestation that accused-appellant actually forced himself against private complainant. Private complainant felt so helpless that she shivered with fear the whole time accused-appellant was raping her. Clearly, contrary to the accused-­appellant’s contention, the element of force and intimidation is present in this case.[66]

Finally, accused appellant casts doubt on AAA’s identification of him as the assailant. AAA testified that she did not see his face because of the darkness, but only recognized his voice. He likewise claims that AAA did not identify him in open court.

Again, the argument has no merit.

In People v. Sanay,[67] the Court emphasized that identifying the assailant based on familiarity may be deemed reliable, thus:

A victim who was sufficiently acquainted with their assailant due to a prior relationship or association, such as being “barriomates,” neighbors, or as the second husband of their grandmother, signifies a certain familiarity with the assailant’s physical features, which the victim may easily perceive at the time of the commission of the crime. Accordingly, even when the offense was committed under circumstances that make it difficult for the victim to ascertain the identity of the perpetrator, as in this case where AAA was raped at night, the identification of the accused is deemed credible when the victim is closely familiar with the assailant.[68]

It cannot be gainsaid that AAA is familiar with the voice of accused-appellant, especially when she had the chance to talk to him on two occasions that day. Notable also that there was no other person on the ground floor at that time aside from accused-appellant, since AAA’s grandparents were asleep on the second floor. Clearly, AAA had a clear perception that accused-appellant was her abuser, not only because of their relationship, but also on account of her interactions with him that transpired before her harrowing experience.

As regards the allegation that AAA failed to identify him in open court, the same was belied by the records, viz.:

DPP SUMALPONG:

Q: Do you know [XXX]?
A: Yes.

x x x x

Q: Did you see him inside the Court room today?
A: Yes.

Q: Where is he?
A: He is seated 3rd from the right side.[69]

In sum, accused-appellant failed to convince the Court that the prosecution was amiss in establishing that he had carnal knowledge of AAA by means of force and intimidation. There can be no doubt that accused-­appellant committed rape under Art. 266-A of the RPC.   
 

Accused-appellant may only be liable for Simple Rape.
 
Both the CA and the RTC held that the rape committed by accused-­appellant was qualified on account of AAA’s minority and his being a relative of AAA within the third civil degree consanguinity. On this account, the Court disagrees.

The crime of Qualified Rape is punishable under Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC which reads:

Article 266-B. Penalty. — x x x

x x x x

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:

1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common­-law spouse of the parent of the victim[.] (Emphasis supplied)

Art. 266-B(1) qualifies the crime of rape when it is committed by a relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree of a victim below the age of 18. Both qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship should be alleged in the information.[70]

As regards the circumstance of minority, the best evidence to prove the age of the offend d party is through a certificate of live birth[71] duly authenticated by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).[72]

In here, the prosecution submitted a PSA-certified copy of AAA’s Birth Certificate[73] which indicates her birthdate as June 4, 1999. Hence, on February 24, 2015 when the rape incident occurred, AAA was 15 years old, as correctly found by both the CA[74] and the RTC.[75] Hence, AAA was still a minor, below the age of 18, when she was sexually abused by accused­appellant.

However, minority alone will not qualify the rape under Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC, as it is required that the offender is a relative of the victim within the third degree, of consanguinity. Despite the finding of minority of AAA, the Court is not in agreement with the CA and the RTC in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of relationship.

It is a basic rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the entire case open for review, that even unassigned errors may be corrected if found in the appealed judgment.[76] The Court finds occasion here to apply this rule on account of the erroneous appreciation by the CA and the RTC of the qualifying circumstance of relationship.

Section 6,[77] in relation to Sec. 9,[78] Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that the information must be sufficient. In the event that a qualifying or aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime, Sec. 9 ordains that the same should be stated in ordinary and concise language, sufficient to inform the accused not only of the crime, but also the qualifying circumstances which attended its commission. The facts alleged in the body of the information, not the technical name given by the prosecutor appearing the title of the information, determine the character of the crime.[79]

On the other hand, the relationship cannot increase the crime to Qualified Rape if the information did not specifically allege the relationship. Otherwise, the accused would be deprived of his right to be informed of the nature of the charge against him.[80]

Relevant likewise in this case is the rule in statutory construction that the disjunctive word “or,” signifies “disassociation and independence of one thing from the other things enumerated,”[81] unless the context requires a different interpretation.[82] When “or” is used, the various members of the enumeration are to be taken separately.[83] Also, the word “or” is significant, in that it indicates an alternative and often connects a series of words or propositions indicating a choice of either.[84] Hence, as a general rule, the terms that come before and after the disjunctive word “or,” are different from each other, the intention being, is to provide an alternative option. The exception, however, is that based on the context of its usage, the terms may refer to the same thing or be similar in interpretation.

Regardless of whether the general rule or the exception is applied in determining the intention behind the use of “or” in the Information filed against accused-appellant, its effect on his right to be fully informed of the nature and cause of the charge against him, is the same.

To recall, the subject Information contains the allegation that AAA is a “first cousin or relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity”[85] of accused-appellant. Applying the general rule in statutory construction on the use of the word “or,” the terms “first cousin” and “relatives within the third civil degree of consanguinity” shall be accorded different, distinct, and separate meanings. This holds true considering that a first cousin is beyond the third degree of consanguinity, hence, “first cousin” and “third degree relative by consanguinity” refer to different relationships.

Relevant at this point, are Arts. 964 and 966 of the Civil Code, which read:

Art. 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.

x x x x

A collateral line is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants, but who come from a common ancestor.

x x x x

Art. 966. In the line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations or persons, excluding the progenitor.

x x x x

In the collateral line, ascent is made to the common ancestor and then descent is made to the person with whom the computation is to be made. Thus, a person is two degrees removed from his brother, three from his uncle, who is the brother of his father, four from his first cousin and so forth. (Emphasis supplied)

Accordingly, first cousins are not relatives within the third degree of consanguinity; they are fourth degree relatives[86] as they are four degrees removed from one another.

The use of the word “or” in the Information allowed the prosecution an opportunity to indict accused-appellant in the alternative, either as a first cousin or a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity. This cannot be permitted as it did not sufficiently apprise accused-appellant of his precise liability in committing the offense. It must be remembered that the simultaneous presence of the circumstances of minority and relationship elevates the offense of Simple Rape to Qualified Rape, thereby increasing the penalty of Simple Rape from reclusion perpetua to death. It is for this reason that Sec. 9, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure requires precision and particularity in stating the qualifying circumstances availing in the commission of the offense. The Information should be precise as to the relationship between the offender and the victim, such that the averment cannot be stated in the alternative. More so in this case where being a first cousin will not elevate the crime to Qualified Rape which merits a heavier penalty.

Neither will the Court allow an interpretation of the phrase “first cousins” to mean “relatives within the third degree of consanguinity” based on how the word “or” was used in the Information and made the subject of stipulation.

The Court has observed that the penultimate paragraph of the Information specifically alleged that the circumstance of minority and being a relative within the third degree of consanguinity are attendant in the commission of the crime. Taken together with the preceding paragraph which contained the word “or,” the prosecution intended the relationship of “first cousin” to be the same as, and included in the term, “relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity.” As previously explained, this is patently an erroneous averment: a first cousin is a relative of the fourth degree of consanguinity, hence, beyond the third degree.

A careful scrutiny of the allegation in the Information would reveal that it was couched imprecisely, thereby resulting in two inferences: (1) that AAA may either be a first cousin or a relative of accused-appellant within the third civil degree of consanguinity; or (2) that AAA, being a first cousin, is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity. Indubitably, the phrasing of the allegation results in confusion which may not be fully understood by a person of ordinary intelligence such as accused-appellant. As such, accused-appellant was not fully apprised that the charge of rape against him was made serious by the phrase “relative within the third degree of consanguinity,” knowing only that he is merely a first cousin of AAA, which should only make him accountable for Simple Rape.

With the imprecision in accusing herein accused-appellant for Qualified Rape under Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC, he cannot be held liable for the same. Since carnal knowledge of AAA by means of force, threat, or intimidation had been established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant may only be liable for Simple Rape.

The Court is not oblivious to the rule enunciated in People v. Solar[87] (Solar) that the insufficiency or defect in the information may be waived by the accused, and that the appellate court shall decide the appeal depending on whether the accuse has already made such waiver. However, the Court will deviate from applying Solar.

The rule is settled that the negligence and mistakes of counsel shall bind the client. This however admits of an exception: when such negligence is so gross, reckless, and inexcusable which essentially deprives the clients with their day in court,[88] or when such mistakes would result in serious injustice.[89] Gross negligence must be nothing short of clear abandonment of the client’s cause,[90] and involves a thoughtless disregard of consequences without any effort to avoid them.[91] In Ong Lay Hin v. Court of Appeals[92] (Ong Lay Hin), the Court emphasized that to be appreciated as an exception, the gross negligence of counsel should border on recklessness and utter incompetence, to the extent that the accused was deprived of the right to due process, thus:

But, there is an exception to this doctrine of binding agency between counsel and client. This is when the negligence of counsel is so gross, almost bordering on recklessness and utter incompetence, that we can safely conclude that the due process rights of the client were violated. Even so, there must be a clear and convincing showing that the client was so maliciously deprived of information that he or she could not have acted to protect his or her interests. The error of counsel must have been both palpable yet maliciously exercised that it should viably be the basis for disciplinary action.[93]

Ong Lay Hin further explains that the nature of the relationship between a counsel and a client is highly fiduciary, owing to the expectation by the latter, that the counsel understands the law and has a thorough grasp of the facts from which he or she chooses as relevant to advance the legal cause of action or defense to be pursued[94] on behalf of the client.

As such, when counsels affix their signatures on a stipulation of facts pursuant to Sec. 1, Rule 118 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, they admit, on behalf of their clients, all the facts stated therein, including all changes made thereon.[95] It must be remembered that a stipulation of facts is a judicial admission of all the facts stated therein.[96] Pertinently, Sec. 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:

Section 4. Judicial admissions. – An admission, verbal or written, made by the party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.

Indeed, a stipulation of facts by the counsel binds the client, unless (1) the admission was made through palpable mistake, or (2) no such admission was made.[97]

In here, the waiver by accused-appellant of the defect in the Information was made manifest during pre-trial. In the same proceeding, his counsel from the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) agreed to the offer of stipulation by AAA’s counsel that accused-appellant is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity.[98] This admission was made despite AAA’s and BBB’s statements in their respective Affidavits[99] both dated March 4, 2015, that accused-appellant is AAA’s “ig-agaw” (cousin).[100] Notable also that the Resolution (On Preliminary Investigation)[101] which served as basis in the filing of the Information against accused-appellant, also referred to accused-appellant as AAA’s first cousin.[102]

Hence, it was gross and palpable mistake on the part of accused-appellant’s counsel to admit that AAA is a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity, despite the documents and the Information referring to accused-appellant only as a first cousin. Surely, We cannot attribute the fault to accused-appellant considering that the determination of relationship by civil degree, involves an application and understanding of the law, particularly the Civil Code. Needless to state, that the rule being considered here – the determination of the relationship by civil degree – is basic which every lawyer ought to know. As such, the admission by accused-­appellant’s counsel during pre-trial cannot be admitted, it being made through palpable mistake, bordering on recklessness and utter incompetence.

In view thereof, it was erroneous for the RTC to admit the subject stipulation despite being grossly incorrect. Quite appalling, that the RTC even mentioned in its Decision that accused-appellant is liable for Qualified Rape on the basis of the stipulation despite being aware of the true relationship between AAA and accused-appellant:

As it is, the fact that accused [XXX] is a cousin and a relative of AAA relative [sic] within third civil degree of consanguinity of the private complainant is a stipulated fact.[103]

In a similar manner, the CA also held that “being the cousin of private complainant,” accused-appellant is a “relative by third degree of consanguinity.”[104] Ever the OSG opined that relationship was present as “it was stipulated by both parties that appellant is the cousin or a relative by consanguinity within third civil degree of AAA.”[105]

At this juncture, the Court stresses that while parties are allowed to stipulate facts under Sec. 1, Rule 118 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, they cannot stipulate on erroneous application of the law, especially when all the facts are available for their consideration. Pertinently, the prosecutors should be mindful of their duty under the newly promulgated Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA),[106] that their primary duty is not to convict, but to see that justice is done.[107] Their overzealousness in prosecuting an accused will never justify a trampling of their constitutionally protected right to be fully informed of the nature and cause of the crime being charged.

On the part of the counsels of the accused, especially those coming from the PAO, they should constantly be aware of their fiduciary duty to be competent and diligent in representing their clients. Canon IV of the CPRA, as well as Secs. 1 and 4 thereof, enunciate that:

CANON IV
COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE

A lawyer professionally handling a client’s cause shall, to the best of his or her ability, observe competence, diligence, commitment, and skill consistent with the fiduciary nature of the lawyer-client relationship, regardless of the nature of the legal matter or issues involved, and whether for a fee or pro bono.
Section 1. Competent, efficient and conscientious service. — A lawyer shall provide legal service that is competent, efficient, and conscientious. A lawyer shall be thorough in research, preparation, and application of the legal knowledge and skills necessary for an engagement.

x x x x

Section 4. Diligence in all undertakings. — A lawyer shall observe diligence in all professional undertakings, and shall not cause or occasion delay in any legal matter before any court, tribunal, or other agency.

A lawyer shall appear for trial adequately familiar with the law, the facts of the case, and the evidence to be presented. A lawyer shall also be ready with the object and documentary evidence, as well as the judicial affidavits of the witnesses, when required by the rules or the court.

Finally, there is also a need to remind the members of the bench that although generally, they cannot stipulate for the parties, they can do so when the same contravenes law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.[108] Conversely, if there are indications that the stipulations are contrary to law, courts may intervene and strike down the same.

Proper penalty

In view of the patent and grave error in appreciating the circumstance of relationship, the conviction of accused-appellant for Qualified Rape should be modified. Since the prosecution has established carnal knowledge and the employment of force, threat, and intimidation upon AAA, accused-appellant may only be liable for Simple Rape.

With the downgrading of the crime for which accused-appellant is liable, the penalty imposed against him should be amended. Although the penalty imposed by the RTC, which the CA affirmed, is that of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole, the same was imposed in view of R.A. No. 9346[109] which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty. Hence, the same should be modified that the penalty to be imposed against accused-­appellant is reclusion perpetua pursuant to Art. 266-B of the RPC.

Correspondingly, the civil damages awarded to AAA are hereby corrected pursuant to People v. Jugueta:[110] P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. These amounts shall be subject to 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision, until full payment is made.

WHEREFORE, the appeal is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The November 29, 2018 Decision of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 01797-MIN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. The Court finds accused-appellant XXX GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape under Article 266-A(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code, and he is SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is ORDERED to PAY private complainant AAA the following amounts: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P75,000.100 as exemplary damages. He is further ORDERED to PAY interest upon the said amounts, at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.

DANICA L. MEDINA, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N



MARQUEZ, J.:
In a few cases, this Court has modified convictions from estafa to qualified theft upon finding that the accused who took private property belonging to another did not have juridical possession over the stolen property. In this case, however, the prosecution failed to prove both the element of taking and the element of juridical possession. Accordingly, petitioner Danica L. Medina (Medina) cannot be convicted of either estafa or qualified theft and must be acquitted.
Before the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45, Rules of Court, seeking the nullification of the Court of Appeals’ (CA) Decision[2] dated 22 June 2020 and Resolution[3] dated 20 January 2021 in CA­-G.R. CR No. 40531, which affirmed with modification the Decision[4] dated 30 June 2017 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), finding petitioner Medina guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa under Article 315, paragraph (l)(b), Revised Penal Code (RPC).[5]

Petitioner Medina was charged with estafa in an Information which reads:

That between the period from September 2011 to March 2012, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of deceit and with abuse of confidence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud the Philippine Public School Teachers Association (PPSTA) represented by Edgardo Monforte, in the following manner, to wit: the accused being then the Regional Office Staff assigned at PPSTA CAR Regional Office, with the express obligation to collect remittances from DepEd and deposit the amounts in a bank, accept premium and membership fee payments from members and prepare report of collections and disbursements of the region, then and there received the total sum of P88,452.00 from members teachers for and in behalf of the PPSTA-CAR which she was supposed to deposit but the accused once in possession of the said amount, misappropriate(d), misapplied and convert(ed) the said amount. to her own personal use and benefit, and despite demands for the return of the said amount, the accused failed, refused and neglected to do so, to the damage and prejudice of the offended party in the aforementioned amount of EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TWO (P88,452.00) PESOS, Philippine Currency.

CONTRARY TO LAW.[6]

The prosecution presented Edgardo Dela Cruz Monforte, former Internal Auditor and now the Chief Accountant of PPSTA (Monforte); Fernando Tamondong (Tamondong), a retired teacher and member of PPSTA; and Nancy Dumbab (Dumbab), also a retired teacher and member of PPSTA.[7] It also presented petitioner Medina’s employment contract, various acknowledgment receipts and statements of account purportedly issued by her to PPSTA’s members, sworn affidavits of PPSTA members claiming that petitioner Medina failed to remit their payments to PPSTA, the notice to explain and notice of preventive suspension PPSTA sent to petitioner Medina, and the Report of the PPSTA Ad Hoc Committee Re CAR-Sub-Office Unremitted Collections.[8]
 
Monforte testified that he developed and implemented internal control guidelines, record keeping and accounting function within PPSTA.[9] He evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of policies and procedures as well as adherence thereof to PPSTA’s policies and conducted audit on all business transactions of the company.[10] He knew petitioner Medina because she was formerly Regional Office Staff assigned at the PPSTA-CAR Regional Office from 1 November 2009 until September 2012.[11]

Monforte also testified that during petitioner Medina’s employment, she failed to deposit collections on time and to report the same.[12] As a result, Mr. Adbulcarim A. Pandapatan, Head of Sub-Office Operations, issued a letter dated 18 May 2012 to petitioner Medina requiring her to explain the following: expense report for years 2011 to 2012 which were not updated; documents submitted by members which were not properly received and forwarded to the main office; and failure to deposit payments of retired teachers.[13]

According to Monforte, a Notice to Explain and Notice of Preventive Suspension were served upon petitioner Medina on 20 June 2014.[14] An Ad Hoc Committee was also created to conduct a special audit in the PPSTA-CAR Sub-Office in Baguio City.[15] This committee discovered that petitioner Medina did not deposit and remit collections in the total amount of PHP 88,452.00 received from members and appropriated the same for her own personal use and benefit.[16]

Tamondong testified that he is a retired teacher and a member of PPSTA who regularly paid the insurance premiums and membership dues at PPSTA Sub-Office in Baguio City.[17] Instead of issuing him a receipt, petitioner Medina only issued a Statement of Account indicating the amount paid.[18] Upon verification of his payments with PPSTA Head Office, Tamondong discovered that his payments for his insurance premiums and membership dues were not credited to his account.[19]

Dumbab testified that she is also a retired teacher and a member of PPSTA who regularly paid her insurance premiums and membership dues.[20] For the period of November 2011 to October 2012, she paid her insurance premiums in the amount of PHP 2,040.00, and her payment was duly acknowledged by petitioner Medina.[21] However, the latter did not issue a receipt to Dumbab; instead; she signed and issued a UCPB payment slip without any machine validation.[22] When Dumbab verified her payments, she discovered that these were not credited to her account.[23]

On the other hand, petitioner Medina testified that she was an employee of PPSTA, and that her duties and responsibilities included receiving retirement papers, death claims, collecting payments and contributions from the association members, and answering inquiries.[24] She was suddenly terminated from employment and told not to report for work because she allegedly caused damage to PPSTA, which she denied. She also claimed that PPSTA never entrusted money to her.[25]

After trial, the RTC rendered its Decision[26] dated 30 June 2017, the dispositive portion of which reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered the Court finds accused Danica Medina Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph (1), sub-paragraph (b) of the Revised Penal Code. She is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional as minimum to fourteen (14) years of reclusion temporal. The accused is directed to pay private complainant the amount of P83,732.40. A legal interest of 6% per annum is imposed on the total judgment award from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction.

SO ORDERED.[27]

The RTC gave weight to the acknowledgment receipts allegedly issued by petitioner Medina and presented by the prosecution, and held that her failure to account for the PPSTA members’ payments constituted circumstantial evidence of misappropriation:

From the evidence presented, the prosecution has established that accused Medina received in trust monies consisting of payments for insurance premiums and membership dues of teacher-members as evidenced by acknowledgement receipts issued by the accused to the member-teachers. Accused as an employee of PPSTA has the obligation to remit and deposit the same to the designated bank for the account of PPSTA. She did not however deposit the contributions and premiums she received from member-teachers to the damage and prejudice of PPSTA.

x x x x

Accused was supposed to deposit the premium and membership fee payments from member-teachers for and in behalf of PPSTA CAR Regional Office but once in possession of the said amounts, she misappropriated, misapplied and converted the said amounts to her own personal use and benefit to the prejudice of PPSTA. Despite demands for the return of said amount, accused failed to return the said amount. Failure to account upon demand for funds or property held in trust is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation.[28] (Emphasis supplied)

On appeal, the CA rendered its Decision[29] dated 22 June 2020 affirming the RTC Decision with a modification as to the penalty.[30] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, Branch 6 dated June 30, 2017 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Danica L. Medina is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1 (b) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and eight (8) months of prision correccional, as maximum. The accused-appellant is ordered to pay the sum of P83,732.40 to private complainant Philippine Public School Teachers Association Inc. (PPSTA) plus interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this decision until full payment.

SO ORDERED.[31]

The CA found that the four elements of estafa under Art. 315, par. (1)(b), RPC, were present in this case:

Money, goods or other personal property is received by the offender in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return it;
That there be misappropriation or conversion of such money or property by the offender, or denial on his or her part of such receipt;
Such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and
There is demand by the offended party to the offender.[32]
The CA held that petitioner Medina was a trustee of the payments she received from the PPSTA members, and that her failure to account for these payments or to return them on demand was circumstantial evidence of misappropriation:

Accused-appellant through her employer, PPSTA, received sums of money from the members-teachers in trust for the latter’s payment of insurance premiums and membership dues in PPSTA. Accused-appellant in her capacity as Regional Office Staff assigned at PPSTA CAR Regional Office had the obligation as trustee of the funds to account for the money received from the members-teachers, by remitting or depositing the money to the designated bank for the account of PPSTA. After receiving the sums of money as evidenced by acknowledgment receipts issued by the accused-appellant to the members-teachers, the former failed to comply with her obligation to deposit the same for the account of PPSTA. The failure to account upon demand, for funds held in trust, is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation. Accused­-appellant failed to account for, upon demand, the sums of money of members-teachers of PPSTA which was received by her in trust. This constitutes circumstantial evidence of misappropriation or conversion to accused-appellant’s own personal use. The failure to return upon demand the properties which one has the duty to return is tantamount to appropriating the same for his own personal use.[33] (Emphasis supplied)

However, the CA modified the penalty pursuant to Section 85, Republic Act No. 10951 (RA 10951),[34] which amended Art. 315, RPC, as follows:

Section 85. Article 315 of the same Act; as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is further amended to read as follows:

Article 315. Swindling (estafa). – Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:

x x x x

3rd. The penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period if such amount is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000.00); and

4th. By arresto mayor in its maximum period, if such amount does not exceed Forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00). x x x

The CA applied Sec. 85, RA 10951, and the Indeterminate Sentence Law to the penalty imposed on petitioner Medina:

If the amount of the fraud is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000.00), the imposable penalty is arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period. This has a range of four (4) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months; with a minimum period of four (4) months and one (1) day to one (1) year; a medium period of one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months; and a maximum period of one (1) year, eight (8) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months.
 
Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances in the case, the maximum imposable penalty for each count should be the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period which is one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months. The minimum term, which is left to the sound discretion of the court, should be within the range of the penalty next lower than the aforementioned penalty, which is arresto mayor in its minimum and medium periods. This has a range of one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months. Thus, applying the provisions of RA 10951, as well as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and taking into consideration that the amount defrauded is P83,732.40, accused-appellant must be sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and eight (8) months of prision correccional, as maximum.[35] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

The CA denied reconsideration.[36] Hence, this Petition.

Petitioner Medina argues that the CA erred in affirming her conviction despite the prosecution’s failure to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.[37] The prosecution did not present clear and convincing evidence that she converted or misappropriated the private complainant’s money, and their witness, Monforte, never explained how he came to the conclusion that she converted and misappropriated the funds she received.[38] While there were more than 50 members who claimed that their payments for insurance premiums and membership fees were not remitted to the PPSTA Head Office, none of them testified in court to authenticate their sworn statements and the acknowledgment receipts supposedly issued by her.[39] Monforte identified these documents, but admitted that he never personally interviewed the persons who executed them nor explained how these documents came into his possession.[40] Petitioner Medina also contends that the testimonies of Tamondong and Dumbab should not be given credit because they were not included as complainants in the Information filed against her.[41] Finally, petitioner Medina denies the allegation that she caused damage to the PPSTA or its members, and testified that PPSTA never entrusted money to her.[42]

On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General argues that the testimonies of Monforte, Tamondong, and Dumbab, and the sworn affidavits, temporary receipts, and payment slips that the prosecution presented in evidence established petitioner Medina’s misappropriation of the funds entrusted to her.[43] Medina’s failure to deliver the missing funds or to explain what happened created a presumption that she misappropriated these funds.[44]

We cannot affirm the conviction of petitioner Medina for estafa, nor can we convict her of any other crime.

The trial court’s findings of fact are generally accorded great weight, and such findings of fact, when affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Court. In particular, “[i]t is a well-settled rule that factual findings of the trial court involving the credibility of witnesses are accorded utmost respect since trial courts have first-hand account on the witnesses’ manner of testifying in court and their demeanor during trial. The Court shall not supplant its own interpretation of the testimonies for that of the trial judge since he is in the best position to determine the issue of credibility.”[45]

However, there are exceptions[46] to the above rule, including situations where the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts. This exception applies to the case at bar.

First, the RTC and the CA were both mistaken in declaring that petitioner Medina had juridical possession of the payments she collected from the PPSTA members.

Juridical possession is possession which gives the transferee a right over the property received, which the transferee may set up even against the owner.[47] A sum of money received by an employee on behalf of the employer is not in the juridical possession of the employee; it is only in the employee’s material possession because:

[T]he material possession of an employee is adjunct, by reason of his employment, to a recognition of the juridical possession of the employer. So long as the juridical possession of the thing appropriated did not pass to the employee-perpetrator, the offense committed remains to be theft, qualified or otherwise. Hence, conversion of personal property in the case of an employee having mere material possession of the said property constitutes theft, whereas in the case of an agent to whom both material and juridical possession have been transferred, misappropriation of the same property constitutes Estafa.[48] (Emphasis supplied)

In Balerta v. People,[49] the Court found that juridical possession as an element of the crime of estafa by misappropriation was not present because the accused was a cash custodian, with no independent right or title to the funds received:

In the case at bench, there is no question that the petitioner was handling the funds lent by Care Philippines to BABMPC. However, she held the funds in behalf of BABMPC. Over the funds, she had mere physical or material possession, but she held no independent right or title, which she can set up against BABMPC. The petitioner was nothing more than a mere cash custodian. Hence, the Court finds that juridical possession of the funds as an element of the crime of estafa by misappropriation is absent in the instant case.[50] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

In Reside v. People,[51] the Court came to a similar conclusion and held that the accused, a school principal tasked to receive tuition fees and forward these to the school, did not have juridical possession over the funds received:

In the case at bench, it cannot be gainsaid that petitioner, in addition to her duties as principal, was authorized to receive or collect matriculation fees from the parents and/or students enrolled in TGWSI. Per a verbal agreement with De Dios, petitioner shall forward all payments received together with the remittance voucher slips to the school. As it happens, the money merely passes into petitioner’s hands and her custody thereof is only until the same is remitted to the school. Consequently, petitioner, as principal and temporary cash custodian of TGWSI, acquires only physical or material possession over the unremitted funds. Thus, being a mere custodian of the unremitted tuition fees and not, in any manner, an agent who could have asserted a right against TGWSI over the same, petitioner had only acquired material and not juridical possession of such funds and consequently, cannot be convicted of the crime of estafa as charged.[52] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

The prosecution alleged that petitioner Medina was responsible for collecting remittances from the Department of Education and accepting premium payments from PPSTA members, and depositing these payments in PPSTA’s bank account, as instructed by the PPSTA Treasurer.[53] The record is bereft of any allegation or proof that petitioner Medina had any independent right or title to these funds that she could set up as against PPSTA. Contrary to the findings of the CA, petitioner Medina was not a “trustee” of the PPSTA members’ payments, as she received these sums as an employee of, and on behalf of, her employer. Consequently, petitioner Medina only had material and not juridical possession of these funds, and she cannot be convicted for estafa under Art. 315(b)(l), RPC.

Second, there is jurisprudence holding that a conviction for simple or qualified theft (in lieu of estafa) is possible if all the elements of theft are alleged in the information.[54] However, the evidence on record is also insufficient to convict petitioner Medina of theft, whether simple or qualified.

Simple theft is committed when the following elements concur: (1) taking of personal property; (2) that the said property belongs to another; (3) that the said taking be done with intent to gain; (4) that it be done without the owner’s consent; (5) that it be accomplished without the use of violence or intimidation against persons, nor of force upon things; and (6) that it be done with grave abuse of confidence.[55] Theft becomes qualified when it is committed with grave abuse of confidence, among other qualifying circumstances enumerated in Art. 310, RPC.[56]

Here, the Information alleged that petitioner Medina acted with abuse of confidence.[57] However, the element of taking, in the first place, has not been established by proof beyond reasonable doubt.

In affirming petitioner Medina’s conviction for estafa, the CA relied on the acknowledgment receipts allegedly issued by petitioner Medina to the PPSTA members.[58] The RTC in turn held that “[t]he total amount received by the accused as evidenced by the acknowledgment receipts she issued is PHP 83,732.40.”[59] In his testimony, Monforte admitted that he had no personal knowledge that it was petitioner Medina who received the members’ contributions, and that his basis for claiming that she did in fact receive these contributions were the acknowledgment receipts she issued.[60]

It must be emphasized that these acknowledgment receipts are private documents. Under Sec. 20, Rule 132, Revised Rules of Evidence, before any private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution must be proved either (a) by anyone who saw the document executed or written; or (b) by evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker. In Maglasang v. People,[61] the Court explained the requirement of authentication as follows:

Pursuant to Section 20, a private document may be authenticated by: the person who executed it, the person before whom its execution was acknowledged, any person who was present and saw it executed, the person who after its execution, saw it and recognized the signature, being familiar thereto or an expert, or the person to whom the parties to the instrument had previously confessed execution thereof. In this case, neither Rene nor P/Ens Pabico saw the execution of the letter. Though Rene claimed that he was personally familiar with Galileo’s signature, he did not explain why or how he became familiar with it. As such, We cannot give credence to Rene’s claim because it does not have any basis. Aside from Rene and P/Ens Pabico, no other witness attempted to authenticate the letter. Thus, respondent failed to establish the due execution and authenticity of the letter.[62] (Emphasis supplied)

While Monforte enumerated the various acknowledgment receipts, payment slips, and statements of account allegedly issued by petitioner Medina in his direct testimony,[63] he did not authenticate them. He did not claim to have seen the execution of the receipts, nor did he explain why or how he became familiar with petitioner Medina’s signature. Only the Statement of Account signed by petitioner Medina and authenticated by Tamondong, indicating the former’s receipt of PHP 1,938.00 from Tamondong,[64] and the UCPB Payment Slip also signed by petitioner Medina and authenticated by Dumbab, indicating the former’s receipt of PHP 2,040.00 from Dumbab,[65] were properly admitted into evidence by the RTC.

Neither can the sworn statements executed by the PPSTA members claiming non-remittance of their payments be relied on to support a finding of guilt.

Jurisprudence dictates that an affidavit is merely hearsay evidence when its affiant or maker does not take the witness stand.[66] While an affidavit may be a public document, its contents will be considered hearsay unless the affiant takes the witness stand. This was the Court’s ruling in Republic v. Ciruelas:[67]

It is a basic rule in evidence that a witness can testify only on the facts that he knows of his own personal knowledge, i.e., those which are derived from his own perception. Otherwise, it is hearsay evidence. In Country Bankers Insurance Corporation v. Lianga Bay and Community Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc., the Court held:

A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge, which means those facts which are derived from his perception. Consequently, a witness may not testify as to what he merely learned from others either because he was told or read or heard the same. Such testimony is considered hearsay and may not be received as proof of the truth of what he has learned. Such is the hearsay rule which applies not only to oral testimony or statements but also to written evidence as well.

While Rogelio’s Affidavit of Loss is considered a public document, it is still classified as hearsay evidence. The reason behind this classification is explained in the case of Republic v. Spouses Gimenez:

Basic is the rule that, while affidavits may be considered as public documents if they are acknowledged before a notary public, these Affidavits are still classified as hearsay evidence. The reason for this rule is that they are not generally prepared by the affiant, but by another one who uses his or her own language in writing the affiant’s statements, parts of which may thus be either omitted or misunderstood by the one writing them. Moreover, the adverse party is deprived of the opportunity to cross­-examine the affiants. For this reason, affidavits are generally rejected for being hearsay, unless the affiants themselves are placed on the witness stand to testify thereon. (Underscoring supplied)

As Rogelio did not take the witness stand, he neither authenticated his Affidavit of Loss nor was he cross-examined. Although generally invoked in criminal cases, the importance of cross-­examination to test the truthfulness of statements, as well as elicit all important facts bearing upon the issue from a witness, equally applies to non-criminal proceedings.[68] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)

It is settled that a witness can testify only on the facts that he or she knows of his or her own personal knowledge, i.e., those which are derived from his or her own perception.[69] A witness may not testify on what he or she merely learned, read or heard from others because such testimony is considered hearsay and may not be received as proof of the truth of what he or she has learned, read or heard.[70] Hence, as a general rule, hearsay evidence is inadmissible in courts of law.[71] This is because of serious concerns on their trustworthiness and reliability; such evidence, by their nature, are not given under oath or solemn affirmation and likewise have not undergone the benefit of cross-examination to test the reliability of the out-of-­court declarant on which the relative weight of the out-of-court statement depends.[72]

Here, only Tamondong and Dumbab appeared in court and testified on their respective sworn statements. Thus, the sworn statements executed by PPSTA’s other members are hearsay evidence without probative value. Moreover, while the testimonies of Tamondong and Dumbab might be sufficient to establish that petitioner Medina received their payments and issued them papers acknowledging such receipt, they are not sufficient to establish that she was at fault for the non-remittance of their payments.

In this regard, the probative weight of the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee Re CAR Sub-Office Unremitted Collections is doubtful. While Monforte identified this document, he did not explain how the Ad Hoc Committee arrived at the findings in the Report:

Q16:
You also mentioned about the result of the examination of the Ad Hoc Committee that Medina did not deposit and remit collections in the amount of PHP88,452.00 what is your basis in saying so?
A16:
The findings were stated in the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee Re CAR Sub-Office Unremitted Collections dated July 18, 2012, of which I was a member..[73] (Emphasis supplied)
Based on Monforte’s testimony on cross-examination, it appears that these findings were based on (1) the lack of deposit slips submitted to the main office of PPSTA, corresponding to the acknowledgment receipts allegedly issued by petitioner Medina; (2) the lack of official receipts issued by the main office, corresponding to the acknowledgment receipts allegedly issued by Medina; and (3) the ledgers of the members, reflecting their respective contributions:

Q:
As you stated earlier, these payments upon receipt by Danica Medina, she issues an acknowledgment receipt?
A:
Yes sir.
Q:
With the corresponding deposit slips?
A:
The acknowledgment receipt only sir because deposit will be made eventually.
Q:
And now who made the deposit?
A:
It should be Danica Medina.
Q:
And where is the depository bank?
A:
UCPB sir.
Q:
And was there any evidence to show or proof that indeed there were no deposits made by Danica concerning these contributions?
A:
there were no deposit slips which were validated and that had been submitted to the main office.
Q:
So because of this lack of deposit slip, you already presumed that the collections were pocketed by Danica Medina?
A:
We also verified from the head office and there were no official receipts issued corresponding to the acknowledgment receipts issued by Danica Medina. And we also verify [sic] the ledgers of the members who paid so there were no payments posted to the ledgers.
Q:
And who is holding that ledger?
A:
The membership department sir. They are incharge [sic] of updating the payments of the members.
Q:
So this ledger is with the sub-office or with the main office?
A:
The main office.[74] (Emphasis supplied)
The Court acknowledges that direct evidence is not necessary for a judgment of conviction. Guilt may be established by circumstantial evidence, provided: (1) there is more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (3) the combination of all circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt. As provided in A.M. No. 19-08-15-SC, “inferences cannot be based on other inferences.” Conviction must be based on strong, clear, and compelling evidence.[75] In addition, the evidence presented must exclude the possibility that some other person committed the crime; otherwise, acquittal on the ground of reasonable doubt is warranted.[76]

Here, the proof presented does not constitute strong, clear, and compelling evidence warranting a guilty verdict.

The above barebones description by Monforte of the Ad Hoc Committee’s audit and verification procedure is ambiguous at best. It does not categorically establish that only petitioner Medina could have appropriated the subject payments. The “facts” from which the courts a quo inferred that petitioner Medina took the PPSTA members’ payments are not proven, as the prosecution’s case is built on little more than hearsay evidence. By Monforte’s own testimony, a separate department of the PPSTA is responsible for updating the members’ ledgers to reflect their payments, and it is the PPSTA main office that is responsible for issuing official receipts corresponding to the acknowledgment receipts issued by petitioner Medina. Based on the prosecution’s own evidence, petitioner Medina is not the only person involved in the process of collecting, depositing, and reflecting the payments of the PPSTA’s members in their membership ledgers. However, no witnesses or other evidence were presented to exclude the possibility that other persons took these payments.

To be sure, petitioner Medina’s defense of denial may appear weak. However, the Court’s categorical language in Balerta v. People[77] is instructive:

Concededly, the evidence of the defense is weak and uncorroborated. This, however, cannot be used to advance the cause of the prosecution as the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own weight and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense. Moreover, when the circumstances are capable of two or more inferences, as in this case, such that one of which is consistent with the presumption of innocence and the other is compatible with guilt, the presumption of innocence must prevail and the court must acquit.[78] (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted)

The above ruling is fully in accord with the principle that in all criminal prosecutions, it is the prosecution that bears the burden to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. In discharging such burden, the prosecution has the duty to prove each element of the crime charged in the information to warrant a finding of guilt for that crime or any other crime that is necessarily included therein.[79]

WHEREFORE, the instant Petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated 22 June 2020 and Resolution dated 20 January 2021 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 40531 are REVERSED. Petitioner Danica L. Medina is ACQUITTED of the crime of estafa under Article 315, paragraph (b), Revised Penal Code, on the ground of reasonable doubt. Let entry of judgment be issued immediately.

SO ORDERED.

Gesmundo, C.J., Hernando, and Zalameda, JJ., concur.
Rosario, J., on leave.","Petitioner Medina was charged with estafa in an Information which reads:

That between the period from September 2011 to March 2012, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of deceit and with abuse of confidence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud the Philippine Public School Teachers Association (PPSTA) represented by Edgardo Monforte, in the following manner, to wit: the accused being then the Regional Office Staff assigned at PPSTA CAR Regional Office, with the express obligation to collect remittances from DepEd and deposit the amounts in a bank, accept premium and membership fee payments from members and prepare report of collections and disbursements of the region, then and there received the total sum of P88,452.00 from members teachers for and in behalf of the PPSTA-CAR which she was supposed to deposit but the accused once in possession of the said amount, misappropriate(d), misapplied and convert(ed) the said amount. to her own personal use and benefit, and despite demands for the return of the said amount, the accused failed, refused and neglected to do so, to the damage and prejudice of the offended party in the aforementioned amount of EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TWO (P88,452.00) PESOS, Philippine Currency.

The prosecution presented Edgardo Dela Cruz Monforte, former Internal Auditor and now the Chief Accountant of PPSTA (Monforte); Fernando Tamondong (Tamondong), a retired teacher and member of PPSTA; and Nancy Dumbab (Dumbab), also a retired teacher and member of PPSTA.[7] It also presented petitioner Medina’s employment contract, various acknowledgment receipts and statements of account purportedly issued by her to PPSTA’s members, sworn affidavits of PPSTA members claiming that petitioner Medina failed to remit their payments to PPSTA, the notice to explain and notice of preventive suspension PPSTA sent to petitioner Medina, and the Report of the PPSTA Ad Hoc Committee Re CAR-Sub-Office Unremitted Collections

Monforte testified that he developed and implemented internal control guidelines, record keeping and accounting function within PPSTA.[9] He evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of policies and procedures as well as adherence thereof to PPSTA’s policies and conducted audit on all business transactions of the company.[10] He knew petitioner Medina because she was formerly Regional Office Staff assigned at the PPSTA-CAR Regional Office from 1 November 2009 until September 2012.[11]

Monforte also testified that during petitioner Medina’s employment, she failed to deposit collections on time and to report the same.[12] As a result, Mr. Adbulcarim A. Pandapatan, Head of Sub-Office Operations, issued a letter dated 18 May 2012 to petitioner Medina requiring her to explain the following: expense report for years 2011 to 2012 which were not updated; documents submitted by members which were not properly received and forwarded to the main office; and failure to deposit payments of retired teachers.[13]

According to Monforte, a Notice to Explain and Notice of Preventive Suspension were served upon petitioner Medina on 20 June 2014.[14] An Ad Hoc Committee was also created to conduct a special audit in the PPSTA-CAR Sub-Office in Baguio City.[15] This committee discovered that petitioner Medina did not deposit and remit collections in the total amount of PHP 88,452.00 received from members and appropriated the same for her own personal use and benefit.[16]

Tamondong testified that he is a retired teacher and a member of PPSTA who regularly paid the insurance premiums and membership dues at PPSTA Sub-Office in Baguio City.[17] Instead of issuing him a receipt, petitioner Medina only issued a Statement of Account indicating the amount paid.[18] Upon verification of his payments with PPSTA Head Office, Tamondong discovered that his payments for his insurance premiums and membership dues were not credited to his account.[19]

Dumbab testified that she is also a retired teacher and a member of PPSTA who regularly paid her insurance premiums and membership dues.[20] For the period of November 2011 to October 2012, she paid her insurance premiums in the amount of PHP 2,040.00, and her payment was duly acknowledged by petitioner Medina.[21] However, the latter did not issue a receipt to Dumbab; instead; she signed and issued a UCPB payment slip without any machine validation.[22] When Dumbab verified her payments, she discovered that these were not credited to her account.[23]

On the other hand, petitioner Medina testified that she was an employee of PPSTA, and that her duties and responsibilities included receiving retirement papers, death claims, collecting payments and contributions from the association members, and answering inquiries.[24] She was suddenly terminated from employment and told not to report for work because she allegedly caused damage to PPSTA, which she denied. She also claimed that PPSTA never entrusted money to her.

The RTC gave weight to the acknowledgment receipts allegedly issued by petitioner Medina and presented by the prosecution, and held that her failure to account for the PPSTA members’ payments constituted circumstantial evidence of misappropriation:

From the evidence presented, the prosecution has established that accused Medina received in trust monies consisting of payments for insurance premiums and membership dues of teacher-members as evidenced by acknowledgement receipts issued by the accused to the member-teachers. Accused as an employee of PPSTA has the obligation to remit and deposit the same to the designated bank for the account of PPSTA. She did not however deposit the contributions and premiums she received from member-teachers to the damage and prejudice of PPSTA.

Accused was supposed to deposit the premium and membership fee payments from member-teachers for and in behalf of PPSTA CAR Regional Office but once in possession of the said amounts, she misappropriated, misapplied and converted the said amounts to her own personal use and benefit to the prejudice of PPSTA. Despite demands for the return of said amount, accused failed to return the said amount. Failure to account upon demand for funds or property held in trust is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation.[28] (Emphasis supplied)

The CA denied reconsideration.[36] Hence, this Petition.

The prosecution did not present clear and convincing evidence that she converted or misappropriated the private complainant’s money, and their witness, Monforte, never explained how he came to the conclusion that she converted and misappropriated the funds she received.[38] While there were more than 50 members who claimed that their payments for insurance premiums and membership fees were not remitted to the PPSTA Head Office, none of them testified in court to authenticate their sworn statements and the acknowledgment receipts supposedly issued by her.[39] Monforte identified these documents, but admitted that he never personally interviewed the persons who executed them nor explained how these documents came into his possession.[40] Petitioner Medina also contends that the testimonies of Tamondong and Dumbab should not be given credit because they were not included as complainants in the Information filed against her.[41] Finally, petitioner Medina denies the allegation that she caused damage to the PPSTA or its members, and testified that PPSTA never entrusted money to her.[42]

",Petitioner Medina argues that the CA erred in affirming her conviction despite the prosecution’s failure to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.,"After trial, the RTC rendered its Decision[26] dated 30 June 2017, the dispositive portion of which reads:

WHEREFORE, premises considered the Court finds accused Danica Medina Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph (1), sub-paragraph (b) of the Revised Penal Code. She is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional as minimum to fourteen (14) years of reclusion temporal. The accused is directed to pay private complainant the amount of P83,732.40. A legal interest of 6% per annum is imposed on the total judgment award from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction.

SO ORDERED.[27]

On appeal, the CA rendered its Decision[29] dated 22 June 2020 affirming the RTC Decision with a modification as to the penalty.[30] The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, Branch 6 dated June 30, 2017 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Danica L. Medina is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1 (b) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and eight (8) months of prision correccional, as maximum. The accused-appellant is ordered to pay the sum of P83,732.40 to private complainant Philippine Public School Teachers Association Inc. (PPSTA) plus interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this decision until full payment.

SO ORDERED.[31]

The CA found that the four elements of estafa under Art. 315, par. (1)(b), RPC, were present in this case:

Money, goods or other personal property is received by the offender in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return it;
That there be misappropriation or conversion of such money or property by the offender, or denial on his or her part of such receipt;
Such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and
There is demand by the offended party to the offender.[32]
The CA held that petitioner Medina was a trustee of the payments she received from the PPSTA members, and that her failure to account for these payments or to return them on demand was circumstantial evidence of misappropriation:

Accused-appellant through her employer, PPSTA, received sums of money from the members-teachers in trust for the latter’s payment of insurance premiums and membership dues in PPSTA. Accused-appellant in her capacity as Regional Office Staff assigned at PPSTA CAR Regional Office had the obligation as trustee of the funds to account for the money received from the members-teachers, by remitting or depositing the money to the designated bank for the account of PPSTA. After receiving the sums of money as evidenced by acknowledgment receipts issued by the accused-appellant to the members-teachers, the former failed to comply with her obligation to deposit the same for the account of PPSTA. The failure to account upon demand, for funds held in trust, is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation. Accused­-appellant failed to account for, upon demand, the sums of money of members-teachers of PPSTA which was received by her in trust. This constitutes circumstantial evidence of misappropriation or conversion to accused-appellant’s own personal use. The failure to return upon demand the properties which one has the duty to return is tantamount to appropriating the same for his own personal use.[33] (Emphasis supplied)

However, the CA modified the penalty pursuant to Section 85, Republic Act No. 10951 (RA 10951),[34] which amended Art. 315, RPC, as follows:

Section 85. Article 315 of the same Act; as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is further amended to read as follows:

Article 315. Swindling (estafa). – Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:

x x x x

3rd. The penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period if such amount is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000.00); and

4th. By arresto mayor in its maximum period, if such amount does not exceed Forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00). x x x

The CA applied Sec. 85, RA 10951, and the Indeterminate Sentence Law to the penalty imposed on petitioner Medina:

If the amount of the fraud is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000.00), the imposable penalty is arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period. This has a range of four (4) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months; with a minimum period of four (4) months and one (1) day to one (1) year; a medium period of one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months; and a maximum period of one (1) year, eight (8) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months.
 
Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances in the case, the maximum imposable penalty for each count should be the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period which is one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months. The minimum term, which is left to the sound discretion of the court, should be within the range of the penalty next lower than the aforementioned penalty, which is arresto mayor in its minimum and medium periods. This has a range of one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months. Thus, applying the provisions of RA 10951, as well as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and taking into consideration that the amount defrauded is P83,732.40, accused-appellant must be sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four (4) months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and eight (8) months of prision correccional, as maximum.[35] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)"
