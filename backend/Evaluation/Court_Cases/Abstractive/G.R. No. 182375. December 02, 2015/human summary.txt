Spouses Suib is the owner of a piece of land which they acquired  through a deed of sale in December of  1981.  Suib – Rawiya, filed a case of  qualified theft against Ebbah for illegally harvesting  coconuts from their property.  Ebbah put up a defense that he was instituted as tenant by the late spous of Suib – Saab since 1963.  But Suib-Riwaya countered that  this cannot be  because the property came into the hands of the Suib only in 1981.
The case was dismissed under res judicata because it was found out that Suib Riwaya has already filed a prior case for qualified theft against Ebbah  which was already dismissed before the MTC.
Ebbah filed for reinstatement and damages before PARAB.  The court finding  no tenancy relationship between the parties dismiss the case.  On appeal, DARAB reversed  PARAB on the grounds that ambiguity in the tenancy agreement should be resolved in favor of the tenant to avoid exploitation.
Suib move for reconsideration but was  denied.  On appeal Suab failed to comply with the documentary requirement as directed and also failed to file his appeal within the  period required by law. 


ISSUES:
Whether or not the dismissal of the case is tainted with grave abuse of discretion

RULINGS:
No.  Mere invocation of grave abuse of discretion is not enough.  There must be a showing that the authority was exercised in an abusive or capricious manner.  The dismissal of the case was based on the existing rules of procedure.  The failure to comply with the directives of the court and to file the appropriate pleading within the period allowed by the rules is a ground for the dismissal of the action.  There is no, grave abuse of discreation.
