    "#     This program processes a raw court case text file and summarizes it by\n",
    "#     segmenting the text into facts, issues, and rulings using a finetuned\n",
    "#     model and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It provides a structured summary\n",
    "#     in the output format of facts, issues, and rulings.\n",

    "# Where the program fits in the general system design:\n",
    "#     The program is a component in a larger system for automating the extraction\n",

Besides, her statement was corroborated by the medical certificate dated September 7, 2007 finding AAA’s genitals to have suffered from deep fresh laceration.
