    "#     This program processes a raw court case text file and summarizes it by\n",
    "#     segmenting the text into facts, issues, and rulings using a finetuned\n",
    "#     model and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It provides a structured summary\n",

    "# Where the program fits in the general system design:\n",
    "#     The program is a component in a larger system for automating the extraction\n",

In order to constitute grave abuse of discretion, Suib must prove that the lower court acted in a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. “Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.” Evidently, the Court of Appeals acted within the bounds of law as the dismissal of the appeal was based on Section 1(g), Rule 50 in relation to Section 7, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Although the decision of the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the petition, did not mention Suib’s failure to file the present petition within the reglementary period pursuant to Rule 43, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, still, the Court of Appeals was correct in dismissing the same based on Section 1(g), Rule 50 in relation to Section 7, Rule 43 of the same Rule.

      "Text: Upon this point, the Court is perplexed as to why the CA affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of petitioner’s complaint when it itself pronounced that “the venue stipulation in the Real Estate Mortgage should be controlling.” On the other hand, the trial court, mistakenly interpreted the phrase “at the absolute option of the Mortgagee” to mean that “the present action cannot still be heard and adjudicated in this court absent the express manifestation of the mortgagee [respondent bank] of its option to have this case litigated in Davao City.”\n",

It simply arranges for the convenient and effective transaction of business in the courts. Appositely, an exclusive venue stipulation can only be valid and binding, when: (a) the stipulation on the chosen venue is exclusive in nature or in intent; (b) it is expressed in writing by the parties thereto; and (c) it is entered into before the filing of the suit. Simply put, the preferred venue must be stipulated in writing before an action is instituted.\n",

      "Text: Moreover, it must be emphasized that the restrictive stipulation on venue only refers to the geographical location and should not in any way curb the right of a party to file a case. This being so, to interpret the phrase “at the absolute option of the Mortgagee” to mean that petitioner should have inquired first from respondent bank which venue it preferred, i.e., Pasig City or Davao City, before she filed the instant action, would mean that she would be left at the mercy of the bank, as she would still have to wait for its response before she could exercise her right to litigate. At most, such phrase takes significance only when it is respondent bank which would file the case.\n",
