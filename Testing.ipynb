For purposes of the election laws the requirement of residence is synonymous with domicile meaning that a person must not only intend to reside in a particular place but must also have personal presence in such place coupled with conduct indicative of such intention.There is no hard and fast rule to determine a candidate s compliance with residency requirement since the question of residence is a question of intention.\n",
