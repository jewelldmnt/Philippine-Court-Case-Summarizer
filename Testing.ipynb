    "#     This program processes a raw court case text file and summarizes it by\n",
    "#     segmenting the text into facts, issues, and rulings using a finetuned\n",
    "#     model and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It provides a structured summary\n",

    "# Where the program fits in the general system design:\n",
    "#     The program is a component in a larger system for automating the extraction\n",

It simply arranges for the convenient and effective transaction of business in the courts. Appositely, an exclusive venue stipulation can only be valid and binding, when: (a) the stipulation on the chosen venue is exclusive in nature or in intent; (b) it is expressed in writing by the parties thereto; and (c) it is entered into before the filing of the suit. Simply put, the preferred venue must be stipulated in writing before an action is instituted.\n",

This being so, to interpret the phrase âat the absolute option of the Mortgageeâ to mean that petitioner should have inquired first from respondent bank which venue it preferred, i.e., Pasig City or Davao City, before she filed the instant action, would mean that she would be left at the mercy of the bank, as she would still have to wait for its response before she could exercise her right to litigate. At most, such phrase takes significance only when it is respondent bank which would file the case.\n",
