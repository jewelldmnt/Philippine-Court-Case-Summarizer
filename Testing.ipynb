In order to constitute grave abuse of discretion, Suib must prove that the lower court acted in a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. “Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.” Evidently, the Court of Appeals acted within the bounds of law as the dismissal of the appeal was based on Section 1(g), Rule 50 in relation to Section 7, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Although the decision of the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the petition, did not mention Suib’s failure to file the present petition within the reglementary period pursuant to Rule 43, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, still, the Court of Appeals was correct in dismissing the same based on Section 1(g), Rule 50 in relation to Section 7, Rule 43 of the same Rule.

As such, the issues raised in the Petitions partake the nature of an election contest within the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). Assuming the Court may decide the case, the OSG maintained that there was no violation of due process because Roberto is not a real party in interest in SPA No. 21-224 (DC). Also, the OSG asserted that the Comelec aptly denied Frederico’s Motion for Reconsideration because it was filed out of time. The Comelec rules provide that a pleading sent via electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. is deemed filed the following day. Yet, Frederico submitted his Motion through electronic mail at 6:23 p.m. On the merits, the OSG argued that the Comelec correctly held that Frederico is a nuisance candidate because his choice of the moniker “Kuya Jan” is confusingly similar to Romeo’s nickname “Kuya Jonjon” and has the potential to mislead the voters. Thus, the Comelec properly applied the Dela Cruz ruling that the votes received by a nuisance candidate should be credited to the legitimate candidate with the same surname.

Again, these matters may be reviewed only through a petition for certiorari before this Court. Otherwise, it would serve as a license to relitigate all issues already resolved by the Comelec on the unqualified interpretation that the HRET’s jurisdiction should be full and complete. In this case, it must be pointed out that Romeo’s proclamation as the winner is dependent on Comelec’s declaration of Frederico as a nuisance candidate. Unless the Comelec resolution is set aside, Romeo will be considered the winner because the votes of Frederico are presumed to be votes for Romeo. It is the Court, not the HRET, that is the proper body to review a Comelec Resolution. The HRET cannot declare a nuisance candidate and cancel a candidate’s CoC.

      "Text: Moreover, Romeo had not yet assumed office. It cannot be said that Romeo became a member of the House of Representatives by “operation of law” pursuant to Article VI, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution. The theory on “assumption by operation of law” which coincides on June 30 following the election is an over-stretched interpretation of the constitutional provision. The language of the provision is about the commencement of the term of office of “Members” which shall begin “at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their elections.” This provision likewise sets the rule on term limitation such that “[n]o member of the House of Representatives shall serve for more than three consecutive terms.” However, the term of office refers to a fixed duration which is not analogous to assumption of office that pertains to overt acts in the discharge of one’s duties. Also, the term of office commences on June 30 following the elections, unlike the assumption of office which may transpire at a different time. Verily, assumption of office cannot be constructive but must involve actual discharge of duties. As discussed above, Romeo’s failure to take an oath before the Speaker of the House bars him from performing hit functions and participating in the deliberations. The proposed theory on “assumption by operation of law” will also effectively remove Article 234 of the Revised Penal Code which punishes the crime of refusal to discharge elective office which states that “[t]he penalty of arresto mayor or a fine not exceeding 1,000 pesos, or both, shall be imposed upon any person who, having been elected by popular election to a public office, shall refuse without legal motive to be sworn in or to discharge the duties of said office.” Differently stated, no person elected by popular election to public office may be charged and convicted of this crime after June 30 following the election since he or she is deemed to have assumed office by operation of law. Again, it is basic in statutory construction that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence – interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi.\n",

The Court must stress that the controversy arose when the Comelec ordered the suspension of Roberto’s proclamation without allowing him to be heard (G.R. No. 260650) and is inextricably linked with Frederico’s declaration as a nuisance candidate and its consequences (G.R. No. 260952). The consolidated Petitions before this Court call for the determination of who should be proclaimed. In other words, the status quo to be maintained refers to the situation when neither Roberto nor Romeo was proclaimed. To hold that Roberto should be proclaimed in the interim is to defeat the very purpose of issuing the Status Quo Ante Order without the Court resolving the issues raised in these Petitions. The Status Quo Ante Order does not authorize any proclamation while the case is pending and renders any proclamation ineffective. In Garcia v.

The status quo order was thus issued motu proprio on equitable considerations. Also, unlike a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, a status quo order is more in the nature of a cease and desist order, since it neither directs the doing or undoing of acts as in the case of prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief.

Locsin then invoked the HRET’s jurisdiction to disregard the Comelec En Banc Resolution.

The Comelec Chairperson should have ensured that the suspension order was urgently released pursuant to the rules instead of contacting the PBOC members. Similarly, it would be prudent if the PBOC inquired about the veracity of the “advanced copy” of the suspension order with the Comelec Clerk of Court who is tasked to “execute orders, resolutions, decisions and processes issued by the Commission.” Indeed, the guidelines in the proclamation of winning candidates allow the ”fastest means available such as, but not limited to phone call, sending of electronic mail, etc.” of the Comelec’s action over petitions to disqualify or cancel the CoC of a candidate. But this quick measure is premised on the fact that the Comelec had duly acted on the matter. In this case, however, the Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022, came after the PBOC suspended the proclamation. Obviously, the Comelec and the PBOC unnecessarily deferred the proclamation and went against the policy that winning candidates should be proclaimed without delay. The PBOC suspended the proclamation motu proprio when it gave effect to the “advanced copy” of the suspension order despite the glaring irregularities. In issuing the suspension order, the Comelec relied on its Resolution No. 9523, to wit:\n",

Yet, the proclamation of Roberto was ordered suspended in a proceeding where he is not a party. In election cases, the requirement of due process is satisfied if the parties are given a fair and reasonable opportunity to clarify their respective positions. In Santos v. Comelec, the Court held that candidates who have no similarity in the name of the nuisance candidate are not real parties in interest and are mere “silent observers” in the nuisance case. However, nothing in Santos allows the suspension of proclamation of these silent observers without observance of due process of law. Evidently, the suspension order directly affected Roberto being the candidate who garnered the highest number of votes and who must be proclaimed without delay. As such, the Comelec should have at the very least notified and heard Roberto. Otherwise, the proclamation of a candidate may be unjustly suspended simply because of the pendency of the nuisance case. Worse, the manner of informing the PBOC of the advance copy of the suspension order led it to motu proprio suspend Roberto’s proclamation.

The Court has allowed several cases to proceed in the broader interest of justice despite procedural defects and lapses. These rulings are in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Specifically, the Comelec Rules of Procedure provides that “[i]n the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules and any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.” Here, the Comelec En Banc is deemed to have relaxed its procedures when it resolved the merits of the motion for reconsideration. In any event, the circumstances of the case merit the liberal application of the rules in the interest of substantial justice. The Comelec received Frederico’s Motion only more than an hour past 5:00 p.m. More importantly, the issue of whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate is determinative not only of the proper treatment of his votes but also as to the outcome of the elections.

As such, remedial actions should be available to alleviate the logistical hardships in the preparation and conduct of elections, whenever necessary and proper. Moreover, the Court stressed that the importance of barring nuisance candidates from participating in the electoral exercise is the avoidance of confusion and frustration in the democratic process by preventing a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate. It seeks to address the “dirty trick” employed by political rival operators to reduce the votes of the legitimate candidates due to the similarity of names and particularly benefitting from Comelec’s “slow-moving decision-making.”\n",

The law defines a political party as “an organized group of persons pursuing the same ideology, political ideas or platforms of government.” Here, NUP’s registration as a political party means it has met all the criteria under the law. The Comelec even verified NUP’s government programs and extent of constituency. Corollarily, the nomination of Frederico and his acceptance as NUP’s official candidate meant that he embodies the party’s ideals and principles which he is obliged to carry out and represent to the electorates. Indeed, Frederico enjoyed NUP’s full logistical, financial; and organizational support in his candidacy. Frederico’s lack of political experience also does not undermine his seriousness in running for public office. Absent contrary evidence, Frederico’s candidacy can hardly be considered a sham since bad faith is a factual issue that is never presumed. In any case, the Court had ruled that the candidate’s bona fide intention to run for public office is neither subject to any property qualifications nor dependent upon membership in a political party, popularity, or degree of success in the elections, to wit:\n",

Membership in a political party is not a requirement to run for senator under the current electoral framework while non-membership does not prevent a faithful determination of the will of the electorate. Also, the candidate’s degree of success is irrelevant to bona fide intention to run for public office. A candidate “has no less a right to run when he faces prospects of defeat as when he expected to win.” Neither the candidate’s act of participating for the first time in elections be equated with the absence of good faith. The Court had overruled the Comelec’s postulation that a bona fide intention to run for public office is absent if there is no “tiniest chance to obtain the favorable endorsement of a substantial portion of the electorate.” Again, it appears that the Comelec Law Department initiated actions only against De Alban and other unknown candidates without a political party, or those with low chances of winning. The Comelec did not bother to substantiate its conclusion that De Alban’s CoC was filed without bona fide intention to run for public office when it remarked that “[t]he Commission is not duty-bound to adduce evidence for any party or for [De Alban] in this case. x x x” Worse, the burden of evidence improperly shifted to De Alban to convince the Comelec why his CoC should be given due course.

Indeed, the Regional Trial Court subsequently reversed the decision and ordered the registration of Frederico as a voter.

      "Text: The striking difference in their names appearing on the ballots are more than enough for the voters to distinguish the entries in the ballots despite the similarity in the surnames. Apparently, “Kuya Jan” and “Romeo” are distinct from each other. Also, with AES, the Comelec’s observation that the nicknames “Kuya Jonjon” and “Kuya Jan” are phonetically identical becomes inconsequential. The principle of “idem sonans” or the similarity in the pronunciation is irrelevant because the voters only need to shade the oval beside their chosen candidate. The claim that the voters would be confused with the candidates’ nicknames is a product of too much inference without adequate proof. To be sure, the only evidence that Romeo was known to his constituents as “Jonjon” is his COC in the 2019 elections. Yet, Romeo did not choose such nickname to appear on the ballots. Romeo consistently preferred “Romeo Jalosjos, Jr.” both in the 2019 and 2022 elections. This shows that Romeo presents himself to the voter as “Romeo” more than “Jonjon.” Besides, Romeo claimed that the nickname “Jonjon” underscores that he has the same name as his father. Thus, the voters would readily recognize “Romeo” as referring to “Jalosjos, Romeo Jr.” and not to “Jalosjos, Kuya Jan.” Further, the filing of CoCs is an integral process in the elections that permits the placing of the names of the candidates before the electorates. The CoC is an authorized badge that the voters could scrutinize details relating to the candidates before casting their ballots. In this case, the voters are deemed able to distinguish between “Romeo” and “Kuya Jan” with the filing of their CoCs. It is more prudent to conclude that the voters know whom they are voting for before casting their ballots. To hold otherwise absent proof is to speculate. Moreover, a campaign precedes the elections where the candidates can promote themselves and remove any bemusement with other contenders because of perceived similarity in their first names, nicknames, or surnames.\n",
