    "# Purpose:\n",
    "#     This program processes a raw court case text file and summarizes it by\n",
    "#     segmenting the text into facts, issues, and rulings using a finetuned\n",
    "#     model and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It provides a structured summary\n",
    "#     in the output format of facts, issues, and rulings.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#     The program is designed to assist in automating the summarization of legal\n",
    "#     documents, which is particularly useful for legal professionals and\n",
    "#     researchers.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Where the program fits in the general system design:\n",
    "#     The program is a component in a larger system for automating the extraction\n",
    "#     and summarization of legal documents. It can be integrated with other\n",
    "#     components like document retrieval, legal document classification, and\n",
    "#     knowledge base creation for further legal analytics.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Data Structures, Algorithms, and Control:\n",
    "#     - Data Structures:\n",
    "#         - String (raw_text, cleaned_text, segmented_paragraph, summary)\n",
    "#         - List (segmented_paragraph, predicted_labels, segmentation_output)\n",

Verily, one is considered a buyer in bad faith not only when he purchases real estate with knowledge of a defect or lack of title in his seller but also when he has knowledge of facts which should have alerted him to conduct further inquiry or investigation, as Krystle Realty in this case. Further, the irregularities attending the issuance of TCT Nos. 40467, 40468, and 40469 as pointed out by the CA are equally indicative of lack of good faith on Krystle Realty’s part. Indeed, what it failed to realize is that, as one asserting the status of a buyer in good faith and for value, it had the burden of proving such status, which goes beyond a mere invocation of the ordinary presumption of good faith.\n",

According to Dr. Basilio, Reghis’ behavioral disorder gave him a strong obsession for whatever endeavour he chooses, such as his work, to the exclusion of other responsibilities and duties such as those pertaining to his roles as father and husband. Dr. Basilio surmised that Reghis’ OCPD was the root of the couple’s disagreements and that the same is incurable, explaining too that Reghis was an unwilling groom as marriage was farthest from his mind at the time and, as such, felt cheated into marriage.\n",

Reghis also fulfilled his duty to support and take care of his family, as he categorically stated that he loves their children and that he was a good provider to them.

In Gagoomal v. Spouses Villacorta, the Court ruled that aside from such remedies, the adverse third party may take other legal remedies to prosecute his claim, such as invoking the supervisory power of the RTC to enjoin the enforcement/implementation of the writ of possession, as what petitioners did in this case. Unquestionably, the RTC has a general supervisory control over the entire execution process, and such authority carries with it the right to determine every question which may be invariably involved in the execution, and ensure that it is enforcing its judgment only against properties irrefutably belonging to the judgment debtor. However, in such instances, the RTC does not and cannot pass upon the question of title to the property, with any character of finality, and can treat of the matter only as may be necessary to decide the question of whether or not the person in possession holds the property adversely to the judgment obligor.

      "Text: The instant case stemmed from an Information filed before the RTC charging petitioner with the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution alleged that in the morning of June 10, 2015, acting on information received from a confidential informant, members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) stationed in Claveria, Cagayan successfully conducted a buy-bust operation against petitioner at an area fronting the Iglesia ni Cristo Church in Centro Uno, Claveria, Cagayan, during which, a heat-sealed plastic sachet containing 0.137 gram of white crystalline substance was recovered from the latter’s possession. The police officers then brought petitioner to the Claveria Police Station, where they marked, inventoried, and photographed the seized item. Thereafter, the item was forwarded to the PNP Crime Laboratory at the Regional Command 2, Camp Adduru, Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, and after examination, its contents tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, a dangerous drug.\n",

The men then arrested her without just cause and falsely made it appear that she was peddling illegal drugs.\n",

Giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the RTC ruled that all the elements of the alleged crime had been sufficiently established, as it was shown that during a legitimate buy-bust operation conducted by police operatives, petitioner was caught in flagrante delicto selling a plastic sachet containing 0.137 gram of shabu to a poseur-buyer in exchange for the amount of P500.00. Meanwhile, it found petitioner’s defenses of denial and frame-up untenable for lack of evidence.\n",
