      "An evening intended to be a relaxing night out between two friends, herein accused-appellant Mario Rivera and his erstwhile co-accused Venancio Mercado, Jr., provided a tragic tableau for the senseless killing of an unwitting victim and the conviction of appellant for murder.  The case did not even have the saving grace of the inscrutability of fate; it was but another mundane episode involving the admixture of bravado and alcohol.\n",
      "Appellant Mario Rivera and Venancio Mercado, Jr. were charged before the Regional Trial Court, Branch VIII at Aparri, Cagayan, with the crime of murder in an information alleging the commission thereof as follows: “That on or about October 19, 1989 in the municipality of Aparri, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, Mario Rivera and Venancio Mercado, Jr., armed with a sharp pointed instrument, conspiring together and helping each other, with intent to kill, with evident premeditation and with treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and stab one Remely Padios, inflicting upon him wounds on his body which caused his death. That the accused Venancio Mercado, Jr. is a recidivist, he having been previously convicted by final judgment of Homicide in June, 1987, by this Honorable Court (Regional Trial Court, Aparri), Branch IX, in Criminal Case No. IX-498, entitled ‘People of the Philippines versus Venancio Mercado, Jr.’ for Homicide, which crime is embraced in the same title of the Revised Penal Code.”\n",
      "Both accused were arrested and, when arraigned, entered a plea of not guilty. After due trial, the lower court found both accused guilty as charged and sentenced them to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, with all the accessory penalties provided by law.  They were likewise ordered to pay jointly and severally to the heirs of the deceased the sum of (1) P50,000.00 by way of death indemnity; (2) P17,128.00 for actual funeral and other incidental expenses; (3) P20,000.00 by way of moral damages; and (4) P15,000.00 by way of exemplary damages, for a grand total of P102,128.00, without sub­sidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.  The court further declared that, in the service of their sentence, they were entitled to full credit for the period of their preventive imprisonment, provided they had complied with the requirements of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. A motion for reconsideration was filed by accused Venancio Mercado, Jr., while accused Mario Rivera filed a notice of appeal.  The court a quo, in an amended decision dated July 15, 1991, acquitted Venancio Mercado, Jr. on the basis of reasonable doubt since appellant Rivera admitted sole liability for the killing and denied Mercado’s participation therein. The subject decision convicting herein appellant is now the subject of our appellate review.\n",
      "The principal facts of the case for the prosecution were established by lone witness Emma Rival.  She testified that on October 19, 1989, at around 11:45 p.m., she took a brief respite from her work as a singer of El Gusto Restaurant and Folk House at Aparri, Cagayan and went to buy merienda at Lansi’s Store located adjacent to said restaurant.  On her way back to El Gusto, while she was about three steps away, she saw accused Venancio Mercado, Jr. stab Remely Padios, a security guard of said establishment, with a weapon that looked like a fan knife.  Afterwards, Mercado gave said weapon to appellant Rivera who then stabbed Remely Padios two times, prompting the latter to draw his gun.  Rivera pushed Padios causing him to fall down and drop his gun.  Mercado and Rivera then ran away from the area.  When Emma Rival went near the victim, the latter asked her to look for his gun, which she found underneath the security guard’s table.  She gave said gun to the manager of the restaurant, Mila Talosig, and both of them, together with a waiter of said restaurant, brought the victim to the Lyceum of Aparri Hospital.\n",
      "Expectedly, the defense gave an entirely different version of the incident. Appellant Rivera took the witness stand and testified that at about 11:00 p.m. of October 19, 1989, he and Mercado were at El Gusto Restaurant having a few drinks.  Rivera decided to request Emma Rival, the lady singer of said establishment, to sing a particular song.  Rivera approached the stage, which was about two feet high, and whispered the title of the song to the singer.  Rivera, however, was “outbalanced” and his face accidentally touched Rival’s face, prompting the latter to slap him.  Padios, the security guard of El Gusto, grabbed Rivera’s collar and dragged him out of the restaurant.  Padios then pushed him and drew his gun.  While Rivera was trying to stand up, Padios pointed his gun at him.  Fearing for his life, Rivera “unconsciously” drew his knife and held the hand of Padios which was then holding a firearm.  They grappled and when Rivera saw that Padios was about to fall, he released his grip and ran away.\n",
      "In this appeal, appellant assigns two errors supposedly committed by the court a quo which can, however, be subsumed into a single supposed error, that is, that the trial court erred in not giving weight and probative value to his testimony and convicting him as a consequence. He also calls the attention of the Court to the fact that Judge Efren N. Ambrosio, who rendered the questioned decision, took over the trial of the case only after the prosecution witnesses had already testified.  Appellant asserts that Judge Felipe R. Tumacder, who originally presided over the case, thereafter retired prior to the termination of the case, hence the judge who penned the decision had no opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses nor to note the evasiveness of their answers.\n",
      "Said contention does not persuade.  While it is true that the trial judge who conducted the hearing could possibly be in a better position to ascertain the truth or the falsity of the testimonies of the witnesses, it does not necessarily follow that a judge who was not present during a part of the trial can not render a valid and just decision, since the latter can also rely on the transcribed stenographic notes taken during the trial as the basis of his decision.\n",
      "There is no dispute that on the night of October 19, 1989, Remely Padios died of stab wounds inflicted by Mario Rivera.  This has been admitted by the latter.  In view of such admission, the Court shall focus its analysis and evaluation of the case on whether or not the appellant had presented cogent, persuasive and compelling evidence to prove his claim that he acted under the justifying circumstance of self-defense.\n",
      "Going to the basics, we need merely note that the three requisites of self-defense are unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it, and lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself. We have consistently stressed that an accused who interposes self-defense must prove every element of this defense in order to avoid criminal liability for the killing or injury of the victim, and he must rely on the strength of his own defense and not on the weakness of the evidence for the prosecution for, even if the latter’s evidence is weak, it cannot be disbelieved after the accused himself admitted the killing.\n",
      "Pursuing his theory of self-defense, appellant tried to show that the deceased victim “pushed him” and “suddenly aimed his gun at (him).” Fearing for his life, so he claims, he “unconsciously drew (his) knife” and “thrust it at him.”  Appellant further testified that after stabbing the deceased once, he fled from the scene.\n",
      "The testimony of appellant on how he supposedly stabbed the victim runs counter to the physical evidence in the case, as reflected in the medico-legal report.  The medico­-legal certificate, issued by the Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital with Dr. Errol Jesus de Yro as the attending physician, reveals that the victim suffered two (2) stab wounds:  the first, “5 cms., 5th ICS line, (R) parasternal line,” and the second, “5 cms., (L) lumbar area w/ omental evisceration.” Dr. Romulo A. de Rivera, interpreting said certificate because of the unavailability of the attending physician, testified that the entry of the first wound was on the fifth right breastbone while that of the second wound was on the left lumbar area, left side of the back.\n",
      "In addition, Dr. De Rivera testified that when the second wound was inflicted, the assailant was behind the victim.  Either wound, both lethal, could have caused the death of the victim. It will also be noted that appellant did not suffer any injury, although the victim was taller, had a bigger build and was allegedly already aiming his gun at appellant before said victim was stabbed.\n",
      "In the present case, the number of wounds, the point of entry of the second wound, the position of the victim in relation to the assailant when the second wound was inflicted, as well as the fact that appellant did not sustain any injury, conjointly belie any pretension of self-defense.  The nature and the number of wounds inflicted by an assailant are constantly and unremittingly considered important incidents which disprove a plea of self-defense.\n",
      "Appellant tried to demonstrate that his acts were purely in legitimate self-defense by citing the testimony of prosecution witness Emma Rival which appellant claims corroborates his testimony that indeed there was unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased Padios. Said attribution of appellant, however, is not only misleading but a gross distortion by truncation of the testimony of said witness.  What appellant quotes in his brief starts with the portion where the witness said that the victim drew his gun after he was pushed by Rivera.  Deliberately omitted was the preceding portion of her testimony where she clearly explained that, prior thereto, she saw both accused attacking the victim, before he drew his gun, to wit:\n",
      "“Q:  What did Remely Padios do, being stabbed by the two accused namely Mario Rivera and Venancio Mercado, Jr.?\n",
      "A:   He took his gun, sir.\n",
      "Q:  What did the two accused\n",
      "do after stabbing Remely Padios?\n",
      "A:   They ran away, sir.\n",
      "Q:  And what was the position\n",
      "of Remely Padios when he tried to unseath (sic) or withdraw (sic) his firearm?\n",
      "A:   They pushed him, sir.\n",
      "Q:  Who pushed him?\n",
      "A:   Mario Rivera, sir.\n",
      "Q:  And what happened to Remely Padios after he was pushed by Mario Rivera?\n",
      "A:   He fell, sir.”\n",
      "If appellant honestly believed that his acts consisted of self-defense against the unlawful aggression of the victim, instead of immediately running away after stabbing the latter, he could and should have informed the people inside the restaurant of what had just transpired and sought aid for himself and Padios.  For that matter, he should also have reported the incident to the police, instead of escaping and avoiding the authorities until he was arrested.  His actuations cannot but put his case within the ambit of our jurisprudential doctrine that the flight of an accused discloses a guilty conscience.\n",
      "Appellant further declared that he saw Mercado “in our place” after the incident but they did not talk to each other nor did he inform Mercado that he stabbed the security guard. Said representation of appellant, if true, is perplexing and abnormal.  Surely, what had taken place was not a mere ordinary occurrence that one would easily forget or neglect to mention.  On the other hand, Mercado would at least have made inquiries as to what had actually happened.\n",
      "Aside from the foregoing, neither can appellant hope for mileage from the testimony of Mercado on which he relies for corroboration.  Mercado declared that although he saw the victim “pull” appellant away and that the latter was brought out of the restaurant, he (Mercado) did not do anything but he just proceeded to drink his beer.  Mercado further narrated that after paying the bill, he went out and saw the victim aiming his gun at appellant, prompting the latter to “box” the deceased.  Still, he did not do anything and opted rather to return inside the restaurant where he sat down and, after the incident, he went home.\n",
      "It is hard, to believe that although the deceased was supposedly aiming his gun at appellant in the presence of Mercado, this witness took no action whatsoever.  The Court understands the postulated hesitancy of Mercado not to get involved in any altercation, considering that he is a recidivist.  But the Court is baffled why he did not at the very least report that fact to or seek assistance from the people inside the restaurant if he really saw the security guard pointing a gun at appellant Rivera who is his childhood friend and neighbor. We have perforce to recall the rule that evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself, and reject these blatant prevarications of Mercado.\n",
      "Although the prosecution’s case rested mainly on the testimony of Emma Rival, the Court finds no reason not to favorably entertain her testimony on the particulars regarding the assault of appellant himself against the victim.  Our review of the records confirms the trial court’s observation that witness Rival testified in a straightforward manner and withstood the rigors of cross-examination.  Any flaws in her testimony on other aspects of the incident are minor errors ascribable to inaccuracy in her observation or perception of rapidly moving events, rather than to an intent to fabricate.\n",
      "Appellant failed to establish any dubious motive on the part of witness Rival as to why she would give a fictional testimony against appellant.  Indubitably, said witness, being a co-employee of victim Padios, would have more reason than any ordinary witness to make sure that the real killer of her co-worker be brought to justice.  Absent the most compelling reason or motive, it is inconceivable why witness Rival would openly and publicly lie or concoct a story which would send an innocent man to jail.\n",
      "Another consideration that sustains the position of the prosecution and derails the proposition of the defense is the fact that any motive for the encounter lies on the part of appellant.  Rival testified that, prior to the incident, appellant Rivera and Mercado had created trouble by breaking bottles inside the restaurant.  The victim chided the two for creating trouble and brought them out of the establishment, as it was his duty to do so. Resenting the fact that they were admonished and ejected from the premises, it is not hard to conclude that both accused had the ill-conceived reason to take offense and recourse against the victim.  Consequently, and on the foregoing considerations, appellant’s theory of self-defense must be completely rejected.\n",
      "The information in the present case specifies evident premeditation and treachery as qualifying circumstances.  However, we agree with appellant that evident premeditation may not be appreciated against him.  The prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence as to how and when the plan to neutralize the victim was conceived or what time elapsed before it was carried out.  Evident premeditation cannot be appreciated in the absence of direct evidence of the planning and the preparation to kill, and that the execution of the criminal act was preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.\n",
      "We are likewise not inclined to hold that there was treachery in the killing of the victim.  We are not unaware of rulings to the effect that even if the attack is frontal, as in this case, but the suddenness thereof rendered it impossible for the victim to make a defense or to escape, alevosia may nevertheless be appreciated.  It is to be conceded, however, that such doctrinal pronouncements necessarily envision that each case must be judged in light of the attendant factual milieu thereof and, more importantly, under the overall concept and rationale for treachery which, if considered as a qualifying circumstance, would change the nature of the unlawful killing and call for the imposition of the highest penalty under the law.\n",
      "The trial court considered the killing of the victim as treacherous on the theory that the accused employed a manner of execution which ensured the offenders’ safety from any defense or retaliatory act of the victim and that such mode of execution was deliberately or consciously chosen by them.  It draws for its conclusion upon the following statements of prosecution witness Emma Rival:\n",
      "“Q:  How come that you saw the stabbing incident?\n",
      "A:   When I returned back (sic) at El Gusto, I thought they were making a sign to ‘APPEAR’ (clapping of hands together) then, I noticed that they were already stabbing him, sir.” which she amplified on cross-examination in the following manner:\n",
      "“Q:  Who were making the sign of appear?\n",
      "A:   Venancio Mercado and Mario Rivera, sir.\n",
      "Q:  What about the deceased?\n",
      "A:   No, sir.\n",
      "Q:  What did these two do?\n",
      "A:   They stabbed him, sir.\n",
      "Q:  When they were making (the) sign of appear? \n",
      "A:   When they were in the act of making the sign of appear, they suddenly stab(bed) him, sir.\n",
      "It would, at first impression, imply that appellant and his co-accused resorted to their ploy of making the “appear” sign to delude the victim into thinking that their intentions in talking to him were peaceful so that they could catch him unaware and vulnerable to an unexpected attack.  This may have been their purpose but, although they did succeed in fatally stabbing the victim, it would be too simplistic to forthwith conclude that there was treachery without considering the legal implications of the facts antecedent to this charade of appellant and his co-accused.\n",
      "As earlier stated, while the two accused were still inside the restaurant they started creating trouble by breaking bottles, such that the victim had to forcibly escort them out of the place. When witness Emma Rival went to buy her merienda at Lansi’s Store much later, she saw Rivera there while Mercado was with the victim at the guard post, and they were obviously joined thereafter by Rivera. When Rival later left the store to return to El Gusto, these were what she witnessed:\n",
      "“Q:  How far were these two accused from Remely Padios when they were making the sign of appear?\n",
      "A:   They called Remely Padios outside, sir.\n",
      "Q:  I am asking where were these two accused (sic) from Remely Padios when they were making the sign of appear?\n",
      "A:   They were facing each other, sir.\n",
      "Q:  And this Remely Padios was with a firearm? \n",
      "A:   Yes, sir.\n",
      "Q:  You mean to say that it was not drawn? \n",
      "A:   It was intact in his waist, sir.”\n",
      "From the foregoing facts, we can readily deduce that the victim was not completely unaware that herein appellant and Mercado posed a danger to him and which necessarily put him on his guard.  He had forced them out of the restaurant and he was aware of their capacity and disposition to make trouble despite his presence therein as a security guard.  Instead of going home, they loitered in the premises and later called him outside.  He would be naive to believe that their intentions were anything but hostile considering their resentment and humiliation after being publicly required to leave the restaurant with the knowledge of other customers.  In fact, when they were making the “appear” sign, the victim did not join them in the act.  Also, we must not lose sight of the fact that the victim was duly armed with a .38 caliber revolver which is more than sufficient as a means of defense against a knife and that, as a security guard, he was trained not only to detect but also to anticipate the presence of danger.\n",
      "Turning to doctrines of earlier vintage but which are still consistently followed as authoritative precedents, we are reminded that treachery is not to be presumed, but must be proved as conclusively as the act it qualifies. The same degree of proof to dispel any reasonable doubt is required before treachery may be considered either as an aggravating or qualifying circumstance. Further, it has long been declared that the qualifying circumstance of treachery must be based on some positive conclusive proof and not only upon hypothetical facts or on mere suppositions or presumptions.\n",
      "Again, paragraph 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code itself requires that the means, methods and forms employed, in order to constitute treachery, must have been directly and specially sought, adopted or used to insure both the accomplishment of the criminal design and its execution with impunity or without risk to the offender. Thus, in U.S. vs. Namit, it was held that where the aggressor failed to adopt a mode of attack intended to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself, the circumstance that the attack was sudden and unexpected by the person attacked did not constitute the element of alevosia necessary to raise homicide to murder.  Where it was not established that the defendant in killing the deceased employed any means by which all defenses on the part of the latter should be impossible, there is no sufficient ground to establish alevosia and the killing should be classified as homicide.\n",
      "Accordingly, in light of the foregoing statutory and jurisprudential guideposts, we cannot conclude that the accused acted with treachery since the means they employed did not eliminate all risks to themselves.  As in the aforecited case of Asilo, the victim was not taken entirely unaware by the assault against him.  Being adequately armed, neither can it be said that all means of defense on his part were impossible.  Here, by the exercise of a reasonable degree of anticipatory caution and vigilance, the victim either could or should have been able to defend himself since he had all the opportunity to do so, and he could have prepared for or anticipated the attack.  We, therefore, hold that under the foregoing disquisition and considering that doubts are resolved in favor of the accused since criminal justice inclines in appropriate cases to the milder form of liability, the crime was not attended by alevosia and should be considered as simple homicide without any modifying circumstance.\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by convicting the accused of the crime of homicide instead of murder, and imposing upon him an indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal, as maximum.  In all other respects, the aforesaid judgment of the court a quo is AFFIRMED.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n"

The court further declared that, in the service of their sentence, they were entitled to full credit for the period of their preventive imprisonment, provided they had complied with the requirements of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. A motion for reconsideration was filed by accused Venancio Mercado, Jr., while accused Mario Rivera filed a notice of appeal.  The court a quo, in an amended decision dated July 15, 1991, acquitted Venancio Mercado, Jr. on the basis of reasonable doubt since appellant Rivera admitted sole liability for the killing and denied Mercado’s participation therein.

She testified that on October 19, 1989, at around 11:45 p.m., she took a brief respite from her work as a singer of El Gusto Restaurant and Folk House at Aparri, Cagayan and went to buy merienda at Lansi’s Store located adjacent to said restaurant.  On her way back to El Gusto, while she was about three steps away, she saw accused Venancio Mercado, Jr. stab Remely Padios, a security guard of said establishment, with a weapon that looked like a fan knife.  Afterwards, Mercado gave said weapon to appellant Rivera who then stabbed Remely Padios two times, prompting the latter to draw his gun.  Rivera pushed Padios causing him to fall down and drop his gun.  Mercado and Rivera then ran away from the area.  When Emma Rival went near the victim, the latter asked her to look for his gun, which she found underneath the security guard’s table.  She gave said gun to the manager of the restaurant, Mila Talosig, and both of them, together with a waiter of said restaurant, brought the victim to the Lyceum of Aparri Hospital.\n",

Appellant Rivera took the witness stand and testified that at about 11:00 p.m. of October 19, 1989, he and Mercado were at El Gusto Restaurant having a few drinks.  Rivera decided to request Emma Rival, the lady singer of said establishment, to sing a particular song.  Rivera approached the stage, which was about two feet high, and whispered the title of the song to the singer.  Rivera, however, was “outbalanced” and his face accidentally touched Rival’s face, prompting the latter to slap him.  Padios, the security guard of El Gusto, grabbed Rivera’s collar and dragged him out of the restaurant.  Padios then pushed him and drew his gun.  While Rivera was trying to stand up, Padios pointed his gun at him.  Fearing for his life, Rivera “unconsciously” drew his knife and held the hand of Padios which was then holding a firearm.  They grappled and when Rivera saw that Padios was about to fall, he released his grip and ran away.\n",

Instead of going home, they loitered in the premises and later called him outside.  He would be naive to believe that their intentions were anything but hostile considering their resentment and humiliation after being publicly required to leave the restaurant with the knowledge of other customers.  In fact, when they were making the “appear” sign, the victim did not join them in the act.  Also, we must not lose sight of the fact that the victim was duly armed with a .38 caliber revolver which is more than sufficient as a means of defense against a knife and that, as a security guard, he was trained not only to detect but also to anticipate the presence of danger.\n",

Thus, in U.S. vs. Namit, it was held that where the aggressor failed to adopt a mode of attack intended to facilitate the perpetration of the killing without risk to himself, the circumstance that the attack was sudden and unexpected by the person attacked did not constitute the element of alevosia necessary to raise homicide to murder.  Where it was not established that the defendant in killing the deceased employed any means by which all defenses on the part of the latter should be impossible, there is no sufficient ground to establish alevosia and the killing should be classified as homicide.\n",

      "At the core of these consolidated Petitions is the propriety of the suspension of proclamation of the winning candidate and the cancellation of Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) on the grounds of lack of bona fide intention to run for public office and voter confusion because of similarity in surnames.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANTECEDENTS \n",
      "In the 2022 elections, four candidates, namely, Roberto “Pinpin” T. Uy, Jr. (Roberto), Romeo “Kuya Jonjon” M. Jalosjos, Jr. (Romeo), Frederico “Kuya Jan” P. Jalosjos (Frederico), and Richard Amazon, vied for the position of Zamboanga del Norte’s first district representative. \n",
      "On November 16, 2021, Romeo filed a Verified Petition to declare Frederico a nuisance candidate and to cancel his CoC before the Commission on Elections (Comelec) docketed as SPA No. 21-224 (DC). Romeo alleged that Frederico has no bona fide intention to run for public office. Frederico indicated “Jalosjos” as his surname in his application for late registration of birth on April 26, 2021, and transferred his voter registration record only on May 20, 2021. Moreover, Frederico was not known as “Kuya Jan” which is confusingly like Romeo’s nickname “Kuya Jonjon.” Lastly, Frederico has no prior political experience. On the other hand, Frederico countered that he has a bona fide intention to run for public office given his government platforms. Frederico was the official candidate of the National Unity Party (NUP). Frederico likewise incurred expenses for his candidacy and extended aid to people affected during the pandemic which are ample proof of his financial capacity to wage a campaign. Ultimately, there was a remote possibility of voter confusion because the names appearing on the ballots are not identical. \n",
      "In a Resolution dated April 19, 2022, the Comelec Second Division declared Frederico a nuisance candidate. The Comelec explained that a candidate intending to win the elections would take steps to distinguish themselves from the other candidates. Any similarity in the names would produce the opposite effect and dilute the candidate’s voter base. Here, the nicknames “Kuya Jonjon” and “Kuya Jan” are phonetically identical. Frederico’s membership in a political party also does not automatically equate to a bona fide intention to run for public office, thus: \n",
      "WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Commission (Second Division) RESOLVED, as it hereby RESOLVES, to GRANT the instant Petition. FREDERICO P. JALOSJOS is declared a Nuisance Candidate. His Certificate of Candidacy for the position of Member, House of Representatives in connection with the 2022 NLE is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE/CANCELLED.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Frederico sought reconsideration. Meantime, the elections were held on May 9, 2022. The following day, Romeo filed a Motion in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) asking to suspend the proclamation of the leading candidate Roberto based on the partial and unofficial results. Romeo asserted that he won the elections since the votes of Frederico must be credited to him. On May 11, 2022, the Provincial Board of Canvassers (PBOC) reported the final election results, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter, the PBOC received through electronic mail an “advanced copy” of the Comelec En Banc Order in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) directing to suspend Roberto’s proclamation. Immediately, Roberto’s counsel pointed out that the Order was undated and does not contain the complete signatures of the members, a certification, and a notice signed by the Comelec’s Clerk of Court. In due course, the majority of PBOC members ruled that the “advanced copy” of the Order was irregular. However, the PBOC Chairperson dissented and called for a ten-minute recess. Meanwhile, the Comelec Chairperson confirmed the authenticity of the Order through a phone call. On May 12, 2022, at 2:05 a.m., the PBOC resolved to suspend Roberto’s proclamation, viz.:\n",
      "\n",
      "Inasmuch as the Provincial Board of Canvassers (PBOC) of the Province of Zamboanga del Norte, through the chairperson of this PBOC, received by way of email from the Chair[person] of the Commission on Election (COMELEC) a copy of an Order to suspend the proclamation of candidate Roberto “Pinpin” Uy, Jr. x x x this board hereby resolve (sic) to suspend the proclamation of the said Roberto “Pinpin” Uy, Jr. consonance to the provision of COMELEC Resolution No. 10731.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the same day, the Comelec En Banc suspended Roberto’s proclamation. Yet, the Comelec was not unanimous. The dissenting members noted that Roberto’s right to due process was violated because he is not a party in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) and that the rules on suspension of proclamation is inapplicable in a proceeding to declare a nuisance candidate, thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Commission (En Banc) hereby ORDERS the SUSPENSION OF PROCLAMATION of ROBERTO “PINPIN” UY, JR. as the Representative of the 1st Congressional District of Zamboanga del Norte. The suspension of the proclamation shall be effective until further orders from this Commission.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "Given this May 12, 2022, in Manila, Philippines. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aggrieved, Roberto filed before the Comelec an Extremely Urgent Petition to direct the PBOC to proclaim him as the winning candidate having received the highest number of votes based on the complete transmission of election results. Roberto likewise filed a Special Entry of Appearance with Extremely Urgent Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) solely to lift the Order suspending his proclamation.Subsequently, Roberto withdrew the Petition and the entry of special appearance with Motion for Reconsideration. \n",
      "On May 31, 2022, Roberto filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus Ex Abudanti Ad Cautela before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 260650. Roberto questioned the suspension of his proclamation based on the “advanced copy” of the Comelec En Banc Order in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) where he-is not even a party. Roberto added that PBOC has the ministerial duty to proclaim the candidate with the highest votes. Roberto prayed for a Temporary Restraining Order against the Comelec Order dated May 12, 2022, and a mandatory injunction for the PBOC to reconvene and proclaim him as the winning candidate. \n",
      "In a Resolution elated June 7, 2022, the Comelec En Banc denied Frederico’s Motion for Reconsideration in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) because it was filed a day late. The Comelec noted that the Motion was sent through electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. on April 25, 2022, and is deemed filed the following day. At any rate, the Comelec affirmed the finding that Frederico is a nuisance candidate. The Comelec then directed that the votes of Frederico be credited to Romeo pursuant to the ruling in Dela Cruz v. Comelec that the votes received by a nuisance candidate should be credited to the legitimate candidate with the same surname, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED.\n",
      "Further, the Commission (En Banc) hereby ORDERS that the votes obtained by Respondent-Movant FREDERICO P. JALOSJOS be credited in favor of Petitioner ROMEO M. JALOSJOS, JR. In accordance with the result thereof, the candidate who obtained the highest number of votes shall be PROCLAIMED as the duly elected Representative of the 1st Congressional District of Zamboanga del Norte.\n",
      "SO ORDERED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dissatisfied, Frederico filed a Petition for Certiorari before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 260952. Frederico assailed the Comelec En Banc Resolution dated June 7, 2022, finding that he is a nuisance candidate. Frederico claimed that the Comelec erred in applying the Dela Cruz ruling and countered that the votes of a nuisance candidate whose CoC was cancelled should be declared stray and’ must not be credited to the other candidate. Frederico also prayed for a Temporary Restraining Order or a Status Quo Ante Order against the Comelec’s directive to credit his votes to Romeo. Similarly, Roberto asked in G.R. No. 260650 for a Status Quo Ante Order to observe the prevailing conditions before the denial of Frederico’s Motion for Reconsideration. \n",
      "On June 15, 2022, the Comelec En Banc issued a Writ of Execution in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) ordering the PBOC to reconvene, credit the votes of Frederico to Romeo, and proclaim the winning candidate. On June 23, 2022, the PBOC convened and proclaimed Romeo as Zamboanga del Norte’s first district representative. The Petitions in G.R. No. 260650 and G.R. No. 260952 were then consolidated. Later, the Court granted the prayers for a Status Quo Ante Order and required the parties to observe the prevailing conditions before the issuance of the Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022, and Resolution dated June 7, 2022.\n",
      "In its Comment, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) pointed out that the Comelec already proclaimed that Romeo won as district representative. As such, the issues raised in the Petitions partake the nature of an election contest within the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). Assuming the Court may decide the case, the OSG maintained that there was no violation of due process because Roberto is not a real party in interest in SPA No. 21-224 (DC). Also, the OSG asserted that the Comelec aptly denied Frederico’s Motion for Reconsideration because it was filed out of time. The Comelec rules provide that a pleading sent via electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. is deemed filed the following day. Yet, Frederico submitted his Motion through electronic mail at 6:23 p.m. On the merits, the OSG argued that the Comelec correctly held that Frederico is a nuisance candidate because his choice of the moniker “Kuya Jan” is confusingly similar to Romeo’s nickname “Kuya Jonjon” and has the potential to mislead the voters. Thus, the Comelec properly applied the Dela Cruz ruling that the votes received by a nuisance candidate should be credited to the legitimate candidate with the same surname. In his Comment, Romeo essentially reiterated the OSG’s arguments and prayed to lift the Status Quo Ante Order. \n",
      "\n",
      "RULING \n",
      "\n",
      "The Court has jurisdiction to review the decisions and orders of the Commission on Elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1987 Constitution is explicit that the Court has the power to review any decision, order, or ruling of the Comelec through a petition for certiorari. Apropos is Article IX (A), Section 7 of the Constitution, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "Section 7. Each Commission shall decide by a majority vote of all its Members any case or matter brought before it within sixty days from the date of its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the Commission or by the Commission itself Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court interpreted the constitutional provision as limited to final orders, rulings, and decisions of the Comelec En Banc in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers. Verily, the Court has jurisdiction over the Petitions assailing the Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022, that suspended Roberto’s proclamation, and its Resolution dated June 7, 2022, which affirmed Frederico’s declaration as a nuisance candidate. Contrary to the OSG and Romeo’s theory, the HRET has no appellate jurisdiction over rulings of the Comelec En Banc. The HRET lacks authority to decide on whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate, and the proper recourse is to timely file a petition for certiorari before this Court, thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "The HRET did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in declaring that it has no jurisdiction to determine whether Alvin John was a nuisance candidate. If Wigberto timely filed a petition before this Court within the period allotted for special actions and questioned Alvin John’s nuisance candidacy, then it is proper for this Court to assume jurisdiction and rule on the matter. As things stand, the COMELEC En Banc‘s ruling on Alvin John’s nuisance candidacy had long become final and executory. \n",
      "\n",
      "True, the Court in Limkaichong v. Comelec held that the proclamation of a winning candidate divests the Comelec of its “jurisdiction over matters pending before it at the time of the proclamation.” However, this statement must be read in the context of a pending case and not to final orders, rulings, and decisions of the Comelec En Banc in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers. Again, these matters may be reviewed only through a petition for certiorari before this Court. Otherwise, it would serve as a license to relitigate all issues already resolved by the Comelec on the unqualified interpretation that the HRET’s jurisdiction should be full and complete. In this case, it must be pointed out that Romeo’s proclamation as the winner is dependent on Comelec’s declaration of Frederico as a nuisance candidate. Unless the Comelec resolution is set aside, Romeo will be considered the winner because the votes of Frederico are presumed to be votes for Romeo. It is the Court, not the HRET, that is the proper body to review a Comelec Resolution. The HRET cannot declare a nuisance candidate and cancel a candidate’s CoC. This remedial vehicle is instituted in the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) and the Comelec Rules of Procedure and logically filed before elections. In other words, the OSG and Romeo’s argument that the HRET should take cognizance of the case would deprive Roberto of any remedy to challenge the election results. \n",
      "\n",
      "The HRET has no jurisdiction over a proclaimed winner who has not yet taken a proper oath and assumed office.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HRET’s jurisdiction is limited to the election, returns, and qualification of the “Members” of the House of Representatives. The HRET has no jurisdiction over a proclaimed district representative winner unless the following requisites concur: (1) a valid proclamation, (2) a proper oath, and (3) assumption of office. There must also be a petition duly filed with the electoral tribunal. In some cases, this Court held that once a proclamation has been made, Comelec’s jurisdiction is already lost, and the HRET’s own jurisdiction begins. However, it must be noted that in those cases, the doctrinal pronouncement was made in the context of a proclaimed candidate who had not only taken an oath of office but who had also assumed office, thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to petitioner’s claim, however, the COMELEC retains jurisdiction for the following reasons:\n",
      "First, the HRET does not acquire jurisdiction over the issue of petitioner’s qualifications, as well as over the assailed COMELEC Resolutions, unless a petition is duly filed with said tribunal. Petitioner has not averred that she has filed such action. \n",
      "Second, the jurisdiction of the HRET begins only after the candidate is considered a Member of the House of Representatives, x x x\n",
      "From the foregoing, it is then clear that to be considered a Member of the House of Representatives, there must be a concurrence of the following requisites: (1) a valid proclamation, (2) a proper oath, and (3) assumption of office. \n",
      "Consequently, before there is a valid or official taking of the oath it must be made (1) before the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and (2) in open session. Here, although she made the oath before Speaker Belmonte, there is no indication that it was made during plenary or in open session and, thus, it remains unclear whether the required oath of office was indeed complied with. \n",
      "More importantly, we cannot disregard a fact basic in this controversy — that before the proclamation of petitioner on 18 May 2013, the COMELEC En Banc had already finally disposed of the issue of petitioner’s lack of Filipino citizenship and residency via its Resolution dated 14 May 2013. After 14 May 2013, there was, before the COMELEC, no longer any pending case on petitioner’s qualifications to run for the position of Member of the House of Representatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Romeo had not satisfied the requisite of a proper oath of office. The Rules of the House of Representatives require its members to take their oath or affirmation collectively or individually before the Speaker in open session. The oath enables the members to enter into the performance of their functions and participate in the House deliberations and other proceedings. The Office of the Deputy Secretary-General and Chief Counsel of the Legal Affairs Department informed this Court that the Office of the House of Representatives for the First District of Zamboanga del Norte remains vacant, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "In Compliance with the Honorable Court’s Resolution dated March 8, 2023 in the above-captioned cases, I hereby certify that Mr. Romeo Jalosjos, Jr. has not taken an oath or affirmation of office with the Honorable Speaker of the House of Representatives in open session.\n",
      "Further, I certify that the Office of the Representative for the First District of Zamboanga Del Norte remains vacant due to the Status Quo Ante Order issued in these cases. However, in the interest of the people of the First District of Zamboanga Del Norte, the House of Representatives in its plenary session on November 7, 2022, designated Majority Leader Manuel Jose “Mannix” M. Dalipe as legislative caretaker. Hereto, attached for your reference is a [certified true] copy of page 52, House Journal No. 24 dated November 7, 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "The “oath or affirmation” before the Speaker of the House in open session is not an empty ritual. To be sure, the third sentence of Rule II, Section 6 of the Rules of the House of Representatives provides for the significant consequential effects of the oath or affirmation before the Speaker in open session, viz.: \n",
      "\n",
      "RULE II Membership\n",
      "Section 6. Oath or Affirmation of Members. – Members shall take their oath or affirmation collectively or individually before the Speaker in open session. The oath of office administered by the Speaker in open session to all Members present is a ceremonial affirmation of prior and valid oaths of office administered to them by duly authorized public officers. Following parliamentary precedents, Members take their oath before the Speaker in open session to enable them to enter into the performance of their functions and participate in the deliberations and other proceedings of the House. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rule has two scenarios – (1) oath before the Speaker of the House; and (2) oath before duly authorized public officers. In the first scenario, only an oath is required before the Speaker of the House and not an affirmation. In the second scenario, the oath of office before the Speaker of the House in open session is a ceremonial affirmation of a prior and valid oath before duly authorized public officers. In both cases, the oath before the Speaker of the House in open session will enable the members to “enter into the performance of their functions and participate in the deliberations and other proceedings of the House.” Here, Romeo did not take an oath before the Speaker of the House in open session which bars him from performing his functions and participating in the congressional deliberation. Thus, the required oath, as a ceremonial affirmation of a previous valid oath before duly authorized public officers, is not present.\n",
      "Moreover, Romeo had not yet assumed office. It cannot be said that Romeo became a member of the House of Representatives by “operation of law” pursuant to Article VI, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution. The theory on “assumption by operation of law” which coincides on June 30 following the election is an over-stretched interpretation of the constitutional provision. The language of the provision is about the commencement of the term of office of “Members” which shall begin “at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their elections.” This provision likewise sets the rule on term limitation such that “[n]o member of the House of Representatives shall serve for more than three consecutive terms.” However, the term of office refers to a fixed duration which is not analogous to assumption of office that pertains to overt acts in the discharge of one’s duties. Also, the term of office commences on June 30 following the elections, unlike the assumption of office which may transpire at a different time. Verily, assumption of office cannot be constructive but must involve actual discharge of duties. As discussed above, Romeo’s failure to take an oath before the Speaker of the House bars him from performing hit functions and participating in the deliberations. The proposed theory on “assumption by operation of law” will also effectively remove Article 234 of the Revised Penal Code which punishes the crime of refusal to discharge elective office which states that “[t]he penalty of arresto mayor or a fine not exceeding 1,000 pesos, or both, shall be imposed upon any person who, having been elected by popular election to a public office, shall refuse without legal motive to be sworn in or to discharge the duties of said office.” Differently stated, no person elected by popular election to public office may be charged and convicted of this crime after June 30 following the election since he or she is deemed to have assumed office by operation of law. Again, it is basic in statutory construction that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence – interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi.\n",
      "In addition, Romeo had not yet assumed office in view of the Status Quo Ante Order requiring the parties to observe the last, actual, peaceable, and uncontested state of things before the issuance of the assailed Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022 and Resolution dated June 7, 2022. The Court must stress that the controversy arose when the Comelec ordered the suspension of Roberto’s proclamation without allowing him to be heard (G.R. No. 260650) and is inextricably linked with Frederico’s declaration as a nuisance candidate and its consequences (G.R. No. 260952). The consolidated Petitions before this Court call for the determination of who should be proclaimed. In other words, the status quo to be maintained refers to the situation when neither Roberto nor Romeo was proclaimed. To hold that Roberto should be proclaimed in the interim is to defeat the very purpose of issuing the Status Quo Ante Order without the Court resolving the issues raised in these Petitions. The Status Quo Ante Order does not authorize any proclamation while the case is pending and renders any proclamation ineffective. In Garcia v. Mojica, the Court described a Status Quo Ante Order as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "As explained by Justice Florenz D. Regalado, an authority on remedial law:\n",
      "“There have been instances when the Supreme Court has issued a status quo order which, as the very term connotes, is merely intended to maintain the last, actual, peaceable and uncontested state of things which preceded the controversy. This was resorted to when the projected proceedings in the case made the conservation of the status quo desirable or essential, but the affected party neither sought such relief or the allegations in his pleading did not sufficiently make out a case for a temporary restraining order. The status quo order was thus issued motu proprio on equitable considerations. Also, unlike a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, a status quo order is more in the nature of a cease and desist order, since it neither directs the doing or undoing of acts as in the case of prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief. The further distinction is provided by the present amendment in the sense that, unlike the amended rule on restraining orders, a status quo order does not require the posting of a bond.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In issuing a Status Quo Ante Order, the Court considers several factors like justice and equity and the desirability of conserving the status quo or the last, actual, peaceable, and uncontested state of things which preceded the controversy. As explained in Garcia, a Status Quo Ante Order differs from a Temporary Restraining Order and may be issued on equitable considerations. The determination of who should be proclaimed the winner is a sufficient equitable consideration. It cannot be overemphasized that an election case is imbued with the public interest. It involves not only the adjudication of the private interests of rival candidates but also the paramount need to dispel the uncertainty which beclouds the real choice of the electorate with respect to who shall discharge the prerogatives of the office within their gift. \n",
      "In Codilla, Sr. v. Hon. De Venecia, the Court rejected the view that the proclamation and oath of office of an “elected” member of the House of Representatives automatically vest jurisdiction to the HRET without examining the context of the case. The nature of the pending case must still be scrutinized to determine the proper body to resolve or review the issues raised. When the validity of the proclamation rests on the questioned Comelec resolutions, the HRET cannot deprive the appropriate bodies, such as the Comelec or this Court, from exercising jurisdiction, thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "Respondent Locsin submits that the COMELEC en banc has no jurisdiction to annul her proclamation. She maintains that the COMELEC en banc has been divested of jurisdiction to review the validity of her proclamation because she has become a member of the House of Representatives. Thus, she contends that the proper forum to question her membership to the House of Representatives is the House or Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET).\n",
      "We find no merit in these contentions. \n",
      "First. The validity of the respondent’s proclamation was a core issue in the Motion for Reconsideration seasonably filed by the petitioner.\n",
      "Second. It is the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) which has no jurisdiction in the instant case.\n",
      "Respondent contends that having been proclaimed and having taken oath as representative of the 4th legislative district of Leyte, any question relative to her election and eligibility should be brought before the HRET pursuant to Section 17 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution.\n",
      "We reject respondent’s contention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue on the validity of the Resolution of the COMELEC Second Division has not yet been resolved by the COMELEC en banc.\n",
      "\n",
      "To stress again, at the time of the proclamation of respondent Locsin, the validity of the Resolution of the COMELEC Second Division was seasonably challenged by the petitioner in his Motion for Reconsideration. The issue was still within the exclusive jurisdiction of the COMELEC en banc to resolve. Hence, the HRET cannot assume jurisdiction over the matter.\n",
      "In Puzon vs. Cua even the HRET ruled that the “doctrinal ruling that once a proclamation has been made and a candidate-elect has assumed office, it is this Tribunal that has jurisdiction over an election contest involving members of the House of Representatives, could not have been immediately applicable due to the issue regarding the validity of the very COMELEC pronouncements themselves.” This is because the HRET has no jurisdiction to review resolutions or decisions of the COMELEC, whether issued by a division or en banc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant case does not involve the election and qualification of respondent Locsin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Respondent Locsin maintains that the proper recourse of the petitioner is to file a petition for quo warranto with the HRET.\n",
      "A petition for quo warranto may be filed only on the grounds of ineligibility and disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines. In the case at bar, neither the eligibility of the respondent Locsin nor her loyalty to the Republic of the Philippines is in question. There is no issue that she was qualified to run, and if she won, to assume office.\n",
      "A petition for quo warranto in the HRET is directed against one who has been duly elected and proclaimed for having obtained the highest number of votes but whose eligibility is in question at the time of such proclamation. It is evident that respondent Locsin cannot be the subject of [a] quo warranto proceeding in the HRET. She lost the elections to the petitioner by a wide margin. Her proclamation was a patent nullity. Her premature assumption to office as Representative of the 4th legislative district of Leyte was void from the beginning. It is the height of absurdity for the respondent, as a loser, to tell petitioner Codilla, Sr., the winner, to unseat her via a quo warranto proceeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Decision in Codilla, Sr. involved an electoral case for membership in the House of Representatives for the 4th district of Leyte. Eufrocino Codilla, Sr. (Codilla, Sr.) should have been proclaimed the winner but because of the Comelec Division’s non-observance of due process, Ma. Victoria Locsin was instead proclaimed. Codilla, Sr. received the highest number of votes, but the Comelec Division suspended his proclamation without informing him and without strong evidence to support the suspension. Subsequently, the Comelec Division disqualified Codilla, Sr. and ordered the immediate proclamation of the second placer Ma. Victoria Locsin (Locsin). By the time the Comelec En Banc reversed the Comelec Division and resolved that Codilla, Sr. was not disqualified and that Locsin’s proclamation should be annulled, Locsin had already taken an oath and assumed office. Locsin then invoked the HRET’s jurisdiction to disregard the Comelec En Banc Resolution. The Court ruled that the HRET cannot automatically oust the Comelec of its jurisdiction in determining who should be proclaimed. The Court also held that Locsin’s proclamation is void because Codilla, Sr. was deprived of due process and was erroneously disqualified.\n",
      "Similarly, the present Petitions involved a question on the validity of the proclamation. The Comelec proclaimed Romeo as the winner after it credited the votes of Frederico to him and earlier suspended Roberto’s proclamation. Absent the assailed Comelec Resolution and Order, Roberto should have been proclaimed because he garnered the highest number of votes after the election results were canvassed. Romeo is merely a second placer. Thus, it is incumbent upon the Court to determine the validity of Romeo’s proclamation before dismissing the case on jurisdictional grounds. This is consistent with the principle of adherence to jurisdiction – that once it is attached, it cannot be ousted by subsequent happenings or events, although a character of which would have prevented jurisdiction from attaching in the first instance, and it retains jurisdiction until it finally disposes of the case. This approach would recognize the importance of proceedings with the Comelec subject to the review of this Court if there were grave abuse of discretion. \n",
      "To reiterate, this Court has the constitutional duty to review the decision, order, or ruling of the Comelec through a petition for certiorari. Moreover, the nature of the issues involved in the petitions concerning the suspension of proclamation and nuisance candidacy preclude the HRET from taking cognizance of the case. More importantly, the HRET has no jurisdiction over the petitions that were filed with this Court before any proclamation, oath, and assumption of office of any of the parties. Given that this Court has jurisdiction over the petitions, we now examine the propriety of the Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022 and Resolution dated June 7, 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022, which suspended Roberto’s proclamation, is tainted with grave abuse of discretion and violation of the right to due process\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuant to Sections 6 and 7 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6646 or “the Electoral Reforms Law of 1987,” the Comelec’s authority to suspend the proclamation of a candidate who receives the highest number of votes with a pending case for disqualification applies also to a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC under Section 78 of the OEC based “exclusively on the ground that any material representation contained therein as required under Section 74 hereof is false,” thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "Section 6. Effect of Disqualification Case. — Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry, or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong.\n",
      "Section 7. Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy. — The procedure hereinabove provided shall apply to petitions to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy as provided in Section 78 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881. \n",
      "OEC\n",
      "Section 78. Petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy. — A verified petition seeking to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy may be filed by the person exclusively on the ground that any material representation contained therein as required under Section 74 hereof is false. The petition may be filed at any time not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy and shall be decided, after due notice and hearing, not later than fifteen days before the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, a similar power to suspend the proclamation of a winning candidate is not available in proceedings filed under Section 69 of the OEC or a petition to refuse to give due course to or cancel a CoC against an alleged nuisance candidate. Hence, the Comelec gravely abused its discretion when it suspended Roberto’s proclamation in a pending proceeding under Section 69 of the OEC against Frederico. Further, public policy dictates that candidates receiving the highest votes should be proclaimed without unnecessary delay. The laws mandate the board of canvassers to receive the election returns and immediately canvass those that may have been received. The board of canvassers must continuously meet from day to day until the canvass is completed and may adjourn only to await the other election returns. The board of canvassers is a ministerial body and its power is generally limited to the mechanical function of adding or compiling the votes cast for each candidate as shown on the face of the returns before it and declaring the result. The purpose of the board of canvassers is to ascertain and declare the apparent result of the voting while all other questions are tried before the court or tribunal contesting the elections. The suspension of proclamation of a winning candidate is not a matter which the Comelec can dispose of motu proprio.\n",
      "In this case, the PBOC received the complete election results on May 11, 2022, and had clear basis to proclaim Roberto as the winning candidate for having garnered the highest number of votes. There is no reason to postpone the proclamation until the PBOC received through electronic mail an “advanced copy” of the Comelec En Banc Order in SPA No. 21-224 (DC) directing to suspend Roberto’s proclamation. Yet, the Order was undated and did not contain the complete signatures of the members, a certification, and a notice signed by the Comelec’s Clerk of Court. Interestingly, the minutes reveal that the Comelec Chairperson gave the PBOC the discretion to act on the “advanced copy” of the suspension order and decide how to proceed with the proclamation. In due course, the majority of PBOC members ignored the suspension order because of its patent irregularities, thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "[PBOC] VICE-CHAIR[PERSON]: x x x I listened to the arguments of both parties. I was also informed by the Chairperson of the outcome, of this brief talk with some representative of the Office of the CHAIR[PERSON]. Accordingly, she was assured that an official order will be released soon until sometime tonight. Otherwise, we are advised to proceed whatever course of action we deem right under the circumstance. I was also aware per information relayed to me from the Chairperson that they still have to procure the signatures of some Commissioners, whether he or she will assent or conform to this order, or dissent, we do not know.\n",
      "We also do not know if such order is forthcoming. x x x In a sense this is not an official copy of the order. x x x [T]his is a mere scrap of paper. Also the CHAIR[PERSON] acknowledges such fact because x x x if they cannot send the copy today, we will proceed with whatever action is right under the premises. x x x I vote to proceed with the proclamation of the winning candidate of the first district. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the PBOC Chairperson dissented from the majority decision to proceed with the proclamation and called for a recess. Meanwhile, the Comelec Chairperson confirmed the authenticity of the suspension order through a phone call. The PBOC heed the directive, resumed the canvassing proceedings, and resolved to suspend the proclamation, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "[PBOC] CHAIR[PERSON]: Let’s resume. After I talked with the CHAIR[PERSON] of the Commission, he informed us, the members of the Board, that this copy is an official copy. And we are directed to implement the order. \n",
      "[PBOC] VICE CHAIR[PERSON]: If I may explain, I talked with the CHAIR[PERSON] and I confronted him whether this order is an official order of the Commission and he answered me that it is an official order of the Commission. So, I changed my earlier ruling and I vote for the suspension of the proclamation. \n",
      "[PBOC] CHAIR[PERSON]: So, the PBOC already ruled with finality that we will follow the order of the Commission En Banc not to proclaim Roberto Uy[,] Jr[.] and hence we will proceed with the proclamation of the 2nd district Member of the House of Representatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "In these circumstances, the Court finds it odd for the Comelec Chairperson to intervene in the proclamation absent a duly issued suspension order. The Comelec Chairperson should have ensured that the suspension order was urgently released pursuant to the rules instead of contacting the PBOC members. Similarly, it would be prudent if the PBOC inquired about the veracity of the “advanced copy” of the suspension order with the Comelec Clerk of Court who is tasked to “execute orders, resolutions, decisions and processes issued by the Commission.” Indeed, the guidelines in the proclamation of winning candidates allow the ”fastest means available such as, but not limited to phone call, sending of electronic mail, etc.” of the Comelec’s action over petitions to disqualify or cancel the CoC of a candidate. But this quick measure is premised on the fact that the Comelec had duly acted on the matter. In this case, however, the Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022, came after the PBOC suspended the proclamation. Obviously, the Comelec and the PBOC unnecessarily deferred the proclamation and went against the policy that winning candidates should be proclaimed without delay. The PBOC suspended the proclamation motu proprio when it gave effect to the “advanced copy” of the suspension order despite the glaring irregularities. In issuing the suspension order, the Comelec relied on its Resolution No. 9523, to wit:\n",
      "Rule 23 – Petition to Deny Due Course to or  Cancel Certificates of Candidacy \n",
      "\n",
      "Section 8. Effect if Petition Unresolved. – If a Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy is unresolved by final judgment on the day of elections, the petitioner may file a motion with the Division or Commission En Banc, as may be applicable, to suspend the proclamation of the candidate concerned, provided that the evidence for the grounds for denial to or cancel certificate of candidacy is strong. For this purpose, at least three (3) days prior to any election, the Clerk of the Commission shall prepare a list of pending cases and furnish all Commissioners copies of the said list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rule 24 – Proceedings Against Nuisance Candidates \n",
      "\n",
      "Section 5. Applicability of Rule 23. – Except for motu propio cases, Sections x x x 8 x x x of Rule 23 shall apply in proceedings against nuisance candidates. \n",
      "\n",
      "Verily, the pertinent election laws and rules require strong evidence to deny or cancel CoC as basis to suspend the proclamation of a winning candidate. The suspension of Roberto’s proclamation depends not only on whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate but also on the statistical probability of affecting the outcome of the elections. However, the Comelec En Banc issued the suspension order based on Romeo’s bare allegation. Here, Romeo failed to allege the percentage of election returns received and canvassed when be moved to suspend the proclamation of the leading candidate. Romeo did not even submit any document or certification from PBOC to support his prayer to suspend the proclamation.\n",
      "Here, the motu proprio suspension of proclamation denied Roberto his opportunity to be heard, which must be construed as a chance to explain one’s side or an occasion to seek a reconsideration of the complained action or ruling. Yet, the proclamation of Roberto was ordered suspended in a proceeding where he is not a party. In election cases, the requirement of due process is satisfied if the parties are given a fair and reasonable opportunity to clarify their respective positions. In Santos v. Comelec, the Court held that candidates who have no similarity in the name of the nuisance candidate are not real parties in interest and are mere “silent observers” in the nuisance case. However, nothing in Santos allows the suspension of proclamation of these silent observers without observance of due process of law. Evidently, the suspension order directly affected Roberto being the candidate who garnered the highest number of votes and who must be proclaimed without delay. As such, the Comelec should have at the very least notified and heard Roberto. Otherwise, the proclamation of a candidate may be unjustly suspended simply because of the pendency of the nuisance case. Worse, the manner of informing the PBOC of the advance copy of the suspension order led it to motu proprio suspend Roberto’s proclamation. Taken together, the Comelec gravely abused its power and violated the rules on basic fairness when it suspended the proclamation of Roberto without giving him the opportunity to be heard. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Comelec En Banc Resolution dated June 7, 2022, which affirmed Frederico’s declaration as a nuisance candidate, is tainted with grave abuse of discretion\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 19, 2022, Frederico received via electronic mail the Comelec Second Division’s Resolution declaring him a nuisance candidate. Frederico had five days from notice to move for reconsideration or until April 24, 2022. Considering that the last day fell on a Sunday, the time shall not run until the next working day. Accordingly, Frederico sent the Motion for Reconsideration through electronic mail on April 25, 2022, at 6:23 p.m. The Comelec En Banc denied the Motion for being filed a day late following the rule that any pleading sent through electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. is deemed filed the following day. Nonetheless, the Comelec affirmed the finding that Frederico is a nuisance candidate. \n",
      "On this point, we cannot overemphasize that courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just disposition of his cause. The Court has allowed several cases to proceed in the broader interest of justice despite procedural defects and lapses. These rulings are in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Specifically, the Comelec Rules of Procedure provides that “[i]n the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules and any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.” Here, the Comelec En Banc is deemed to have relaxed its procedures when it resolved the merits of the motion for reconsideration. In any event, the circumstances of the case merit the liberal application of the rules in the interest of substantial justice. The Comelec received Frederico’s Motion only more than an hour past 5:00 p.m. More importantly, the issue of whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate is determinative not only of the proper treatment of his votes but also as to the outcome of the elections. The grave injustice to Frederico is likewise not commensurate with his failure to comply with the rules. Thus, compelling reasons exist for the Court to finally settle the question of whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate.\n",
      "Section 69 of the OEC provides the remedy and the instances when candidates may be considered nuisance, thus: \n",
      "\n",
      "Section 69. Nuisance candidates. — The Commission may, motu proprio or upon a verified petition of an interested party, refuse to give due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy if it is shown that said certificate has been filed to put the election process in mockery or disrepute or to cause confusion among the voters by the similarity of the names of the registered candidates or by other circumstances or acts which clearly demonstrate that the candidate has no bona fide intention to run for the office for which the certificate of candidacy has been filed and thus prevent a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, nuisance candidates are those who filed their CoCs: (1) to put” the election process in mockery or disrepute; (2) to cause confusion among the voters by the similarity of the names of the registered candidates; or (3) under circumstances or acts which clearly demonstrate that the candidate has no bona fide intention to run for the office for which the CoC has been filed. The common thread of the three instances is that nuisance candidates filed their CoCs not to aspire or seek public office but to prevent “a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate.” In De Alban v. Comelec, the Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 69 of the OEC and expounded on the Comelec’s power to refuse to give due course to or cancel the CoCs of nuisance candidates, viz.: \n",
      "\n",
      "Remarkably, even before the enactment of Section 69 of the OEC the Court already acknowledged the Comelec’s authority to refuse due course to CoCs filed in bad faith pursuant to its mandate to ensure free, orderly, and honest elections. In subsequent cases, the Court held that limiting the names of candidates appearing on the ballots for those with “bona fide” intention to run for office is permissible. The Court observed that the greater the number of candidates, the greater opportunities for logistical confusion, not to mention the increased allocation of time and resources in preparation for election. As such, remedial actions should be available to alleviate the logistical hardships in the preparation and conduct of elections, whenever necessary and proper. Moreover, the Court stressed that the importance of barring nuisance candidates from participating in the electoral exercise is the avoidance of confusion and frustration in the democratic process by preventing a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate. It seeks to address the “dirty trick” employed by political rival operators to reduce the votes of the legitimate candidates due to the similarity of names and particularly benefitting from Comelec’s “slow-moving decision-making.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the Comelec declared Frederico a nuisance candidate because he has no bona fide intention to run for public office, and his surname and nickname can cause confusion among voters. On this score, we reiterate that the Comelec has the ministerial duty to receive and acknowledge a CoC submitted within the filing period using the prescribed form. The candidate’s name will be on the ballot unless the CoC is withdrawn or canceled. Corollary, the question of who may be considered a nuisance candidate is a factual issue that should be decided minutely and wisely. It is also incumbent upon Romeo to establish the acts or circumstances showing that Frederico is a nuisance candidate, with the objective to prevent a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate. Yet, Romeo heavily relied on Frederico’s lack of political experience, and the similarity of their surnames and nicknames. \n",
      "Foremost, Frederico’s membership in NUP is not trivial and weighs heavily against a finding of nuisance candidacy. The law defines a political party as “an organized group of persons pursuing the same ideology, political ideas or platforms of government.” Here, NUP’s registration as a political party means it has met all the criteria under the law. The Comelec even verified NUP’s government programs and extent of constituency. Corollarily, the nomination of Frederico and his acceptance as NUP’s official candidate meant that he embodies the party’s ideals and principles which he is obliged to carry out and represent to the electorates. Indeed, Frederico enjoyed NUP’s full logistical, financial; and organizational support in his candidacy. Frederico’s lack of political experience also does not undermine his seriousness in running for public office. Absent contrary evidence, Frederico’s candidacy can hardly be considered a sham since bad faith is a factual issue that is never presumed. In any case, the Court had ruled that the candidate’s bona fide intention to run for public office is neither subject to any property qualifications nor dependent upon membership in a political party, popularity, or degree of success in the elections, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "In the same vein, the Court finds that non-membership in a political party or being unknown nationwide, or the low probability of success do not by themselves equate to the absence of bona fide intention to run for public office under Section 69 of the OEC. Membership in a political party is not a requirement to run for senator under the current electoral framework while non-membership does not prevent a faithful determination of the will of the electorate. Also, the candidate’s degree of success is irrelevant to bona fide intention to run for public office. A candidate “has no less a right to run when he faces prospects of defeat as when he expected to win.” Neither the candidate’s act of participating for the first time in elections be equated with the absence of good faith. The Court had overruled the Comelec’s postulation that a bona fide intention to run for public office is absent if there is no “tiniest chance to obtain the favorable endorsement of a substantial portion of the electorate.” Again, it appears that the Comelec Law Department initiated actions only against De Alban and other unknown candidates without a political party, or those with low chances of winning. The Comelec did not bother to substantiate its conclusion that De Alban’s CoC was filed without bona fide intention to run for public office when it remarked that “[t]he Commission is not duty-bound to adduce evidence for any party or for [De Alban] in this case. x x x” Worse, the burden of evidence improperly shifted to De Alban to convince the Comelec why his CoC should be given due course. To reiterate, the Comelec has the ministerial duty to receive and acknowledge a duly filed CoC. The candidate’s name will be on the ballot unless the CoC is withdrawn or canceled. \n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the Comelec Second Division failed to explain its findings that Frederico lacks the support and capacity to launch a credible and serious campaign, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "Other circumstances exist that belie bona fide intent. As correctly alleged by [Romeo], [Frederico] does not appear to have the support and capacity required to launch a credible campaign. The bare reliance on the support of his political party is insufficient. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Comelec’s observation begs the following questions: (1) what then was the basis to consider Frederico’s membership in the political party as insignificant? (2) are the allegations of Romeo sufficient to conclude lack of bona fide intent? Notably, the use of the phrase “does not appear” in the assailed Resolution and the absence of particular evidence showing that Frederico’s political party will not support him show that the Comelec’s ruling is speculative. The finding of the Comelec Second Division that Frederico is not a registered voter is likewise erroneous because the decision of the first-level court denying Frederico’s Petition to be included in the list of voters has not yet attained finality. Indeed, the Regional Trial Court subsequently reversed the decision and ordered the registration of Frederico as a voter. Accordingly, the Court should not allow the Comelec to perfunctorily invoke the evil caused by nuisance candidates without adequate proof to support a conclusion that a candidate is a nuisance in the first place.\n",
      "Likewise, there is a distant possibility of voter confusion because the entries appearing on the ballots are not indistinguishable. The automated elections system (AES) ensured sufficient identifiers on the entries appearing on the ballots. The candidates’ complete names and political parties are now printed on the ballots. The Comelec guidelines even allow the candidates to choose the names appearing on the ballots, including the political parties that nominated them, if any. Here, Frederico and Romeo preferred that their names be printed on the ballots as “Jalosjos, Kuya Jan (NUP)“ and “Jalosjos, Jr. Romeo (NP),” respectively, to wit: \n",
      "\n",
      "The striking difference in their names appearing on the ballots are more than enough for the voters to distinguish the entries in the ballots despite the similarity in the surnames. Apparently, “Kuya Jan” and “Romeo” are distinct from each other. Also, with AES, the Comelec’s observation that the nicknames “Kuya Jonjon” and “Kuya Jan” are phonetically identical becomes inconsequential. The principle of “idem sonans” or the similarity in the pronunciation is irrelevant because the voters only need to shade the oval beside their chosen candidate. The claim that the voters would be confused with the candidates’ nicknames is a product of too much inference without adequate proof. To be sure, the only evidence that Romeo was known to his constituents as “Jonjon” is his COC in the 2019 elections. Yet, Romeo did not choose such nickname to appear on the ballots. Romeo consistently preferred “Romeo Jalosjos, Jr.” both in the 2019 and 2022 elections. This shows that Romeo presents himself to the voter as “Romeo” more than “Jonjon.” Besides, Romeo claimed that the nickname “Jonjon” underscores that he has the same name as his father. Thus, the voters would readily recognize “Romeo” as referring to “Jalosjos, Romeo Jr.” and not to “Jalosjos, Kuya Jan.” Further, the filing of CoCs is an integral process in the elections that permits the placing of the names of the candidates before the electorates. The CoC is an authorized badge that the voters could scrutinize details relating to the candidates before casting their ballots. In this case, the voters are deemed able to distinguish between “Romeo” and “Kuya Jan” with the filing of their CoCs. It is more prudent to conclude that the voters know whom they are voting for before casting their ballots. To hold otherwise absent proof is to speculate. Moreover, a campaign precedes the elections where the candidates can promote themselves and remove any bemusement with other contenders because of perceived similarity in their first names, nicknames, or surnames.\n",
      "Finally, in Bautista v. Comelec, a case decided under the manual elections system, the Court upheld the Comelec’s finding that similarity in the names would prevent a faithful determination of the will of the people because a vote containing only the nickname or surname of a candidate would render that vote worthless, thus: “Two ‘EFRENS’ and two ‘BAUTISTAS’ — will necessarily confuse the voters and render worthless a vote for an ‘Efren’ or ‘Bautista’ during the appreciation of ballots, thus preventing the determination of the choice and true will of the electorate.” Under a manual election system, a vote is deemed stray if the voters only wrote the first name or surname of a candidate if at least two candidates have the same first name or surname, to wit: “Section 211. Rules for the appreciation of ballots. x x x 1. Where only the first name of a candidate or only his surname is written, the vote for such a candidate is valid, if there is no other candidate with the same first name or surname for the same office.”\n",
      "Here, the Comelec (Second Division) did not discuss how the inclusion of Frederico’s name in the ballots would prevent the faithful determination of the will of the electorate. The Comelec’s observation of an “inversely proportional relationship between identity of names and the required proof showing the absence of bona fide intent” is erroneous. The opinion is based on a misreading of the cited cases and does not excuse the Comelec from identifying why a particular candidacy would prevent the determination of the will of the people, viz.: \n",
      "\n",
      "In identifying confusing similarity of names, this Commission (Second Division) is guided by a catena of cases resolved by the Supreme Court. A review of these cases shows that there is no hard-and-fast rule in determining whether or not a candidate filed their COC to cause confusion among the voters. Instead, a broad range of circumstances has been deemed sufficient to cause confusion.\n",
      "On one end of this range are the cases of Bautista v. COMELEC and Zapanta v. COMELEC, where the candidates’ intended names on the ballots were totally identical save for their ballot number and party designation. In these decisions, the fact that the candidates were not publicly known by the name they sought to have in the ballot, when taken with even the slightest indicia that there was no bona fide intent to run, was deemed insufficient to declare them as nuisance candidates.\n",
      "In the “middle” of the spectrum are the cases where identical surnames and similar-sounding given names on the ballot adjudged as sufficient to constitute confusing similarity, such as Santos v. COMELEC. There, the fact that a candidate intentionally chose a similar sounding stage-name to appear on the ballot, despite never having used that name before, when taken with an apparent lack of support, was deemed sufficient to declare her a nuisance candidate. \n",
      "Closer to the other end of this range is the case of Dela Cruz v. COMELEC, where only the identity in surnames were present. In this case, it was found that the identical nature of the surnames, when taken together with proof that the nuisance candidate was a retiree with no source of income, no prior political experience, and other circumstances that belied bona fide intent to run, was sufficient to declare him a nuisance candidate.\n",
      "Clearly, each case must be reviewed on its individual facts and circumstances, but it appears from the foregoing that there is an inversely proportional relationship between identity of names and the required proof showing the absence of bona fide intent. Thus, the greater the similarity between the names of the candidates, the less indications of a lack of bona fide intent to run must be apparent, and vice-versa. \n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed above, the case of Bautista held that a vote containing only the first name, nickname, or surname of a candidate would render that vote worthless in case at least two candidates have the same first name, nickname, or surname. In Zapanta v. Comelec, the identical names of two candidates appearing on the ballots made it difficult for voters to distinguish them and would prevent the faithful determination of the will of the people. On the other hand, Dela Cruz v. Comelec did not rule that mere identity in surnames of candidates is enough to declare a candidate as a nuisance. The case deals with the issue of how the votes of nuisance candidates should be treated and not the Comelec’s finding of nuisance candidacy. Also, the ruling tackles the validity of Resolution No. 8844 regarding the proper treatment of votes of all candidates who were disqualified or whose CoCs were cancelled but their names remained in the ballots. Whereas Santos v. Comelec did not authorize the declaration of a nuisance candidate because of a similar-sounding stage name. The issue is whether the Comelec may automatically credit the votes of nuisance candidates to the legitimate candidate in a multi-slot office. The writ of execution was questioned and not the declaration of nuisance candidacy.\n",
      "More importantly, the statement in Dela Cruz and Santos that “the possibility of confusion in names of candidates if the names of the nuisance candidates remained on election day, cannot be discounted or eliminated, even under the automated voting system“ does not authorize the Comelec to automatically declare a candidate a nuisance “even with the slightest indicia that there was no bona fide intent to run.” The Comelec must clearly state in its resolution why a candidate falls under the definition of a nuisance candidate under Section 69 of the OEC. In this case, the Comelec rendered the determination of the bona fide intent to run for public office insignificant. The Comelec solely based its ruling on the alleged erroneous use of a nickname in declaring Frederico a nuisance without considering his membership in the political party, the importance of a CoC, the preceding campaign period, and the dissimilarities in the names appearing on the ballots.\n",
      "At any rate, the erroneous use of a nickname registered in the CoC is not enough to declare a candidate nuisance. The proper recourse is to bring this to the attention of the Comelec as a defect of an entry in the CoC to disallow a candidate from using that nickname. The rules and regulations for the conduct of elections are mandatory before the election, but when they are sought to be enforced after the election, they are held to be directory only if that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, innocent voters will be deprived of their votes without fault on their part. Thus, even if the CoC was not duly signed or does not contain the required data, the proclamation of the candidate as the winner may not be nullified on such grounds. The defects in the certificate should have been questioned before the election; they may not be questioned after the election without invalidating the will of the electorate, which should not be done. To uphold the cancellation of Frederico’s CoC due to an erroneous use of nickname after the votes were cast would render the electorates’ votes for Frederico worthless.\n",
      "The Court reminds that the use of wrong, irrelevant, and insufficient considerations in deciding an issue taints a decision maker’s action with grave abuse of discretion. A judgment rendered with grave abuse of discretion is void and cannot be the source of any right or obligation. All acts pursuant to such decision and all claims .emanating from it have no legal effect. A void judgment can never become final and any writ of execution based on it is likewise void. In sum, the Comelec committed grave abuse of discretion in canceling Frederico’s CoC absent supporting substantial evidence that he is a nuisance candidate. Frederico is a legitimate candidate and the votes he received are all valid. There is no more question as to the proper treatment of his votes. Consequently, these findings rendered moot the issue of whether the votes in favor of a nuisance candidate should be declared stray or must be credited to the legitimate candidate with the same surname.\n",

Again, these matters may be reviewed only through a petition for certiorari before this Court. Otherwise, it would serve as a license to relitigate all issues already resolved by the Comelec on the unqualified interpretation that the HRET’s jurisdiction should be full and complete. In this case, it must be pointed out that Romeo’s proclamation as the winner is dependent on Comelec’s declaration of Frederico as a nuisance candidate. Unless the Comelec resolution is set aside, Romeo will be considered the winner because the votes of Frederico are presumed to be votes for Romeo. It is the Court, not the HRET, that is the proper body to review a Comelec Resolution. The HRET cannot declare a nuisance candidate and cancel a candidate’s CoC. This remedial vehicle is instituted in the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) and the Comelec Rules of Procedure and logically filed before elections. In other words, the OSG and Romeo’s argument that the HRET should take cognizance of the case would deprive Roberto of any remedy to challenge the election results.\n",

      "Text: Moreover, Romeo had not yet assumed office. It cannot be said that Romeo became a member of the House of Representatives by “operation of law” pursuant to Article VI, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution. The theory on “assumption by operation of law” which coincides on June 30 following the election is an over-stretched interpretation of the constitutional provision. The language of the provision is about the commencement of the term of office of “Members” which shall begin “at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their elections.” This provision likewise sets the rule on term limitation such that “[n]o member of the House of Representatives shall serve for more than three consecutive terms.” However, the term of office refers to a fixed duration which is not analogous to assumption of office that pertains to overt acts in the discharge of one’s duties. Also, the term of office commences on June 30 following the elections, unlike the assumption of office which may transpire at a different time. Verily, assumption of office cannot be constructive but must involve actual discharge of duties. As discussed above, Romeo’s failure to take an oath before the Speaker of the House bars him from performing hit functions and participating in the deliberations. The proposed theory on “assumption by operation of law” will also effectively remove Article 234 of the Revised Penal Code which punishes the crime of refusal to discharge elective office which states that “[t]he penalty of arresto mayor or a fine not exceeding 1,000 pesos, or both, shall be imposed upon any person who, having been elected by popular election to a public office, shall refuse without legal motive to be sworn in or to discharge the duties of said office.” Differently stated, no person elected by popular election to public office may be charged and convicted of this crime after June 30 following the election since he or she is deemed to have assumed office by operation of law. Again, it is basic in statutory construction that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence – interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi.\n",

The Court must stress that the controversy arose when the Comelec ordered the suspension of Roberto’s proclamation without allowing him to be heard (G.R.

The status quo order was thus issued motu proprio on equitable considerations. Also, unlike a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, a status quo order is more in the nature of a cease and desist order, since it neither directs the doing or undoing of acts as in the case of prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief.

Hence, the Comelec gravely abused its discretion when it suspended Roberto’s proclamation in a pending proceeding under Section 69 of the OEC against Frederico. Further, public policy dictates that candidates receiving the highest votes should be proclaimed without unnecessary delay. The laws mandate the board of canvassers to receive the election returns and immediately canvass those that may have been received. The board of canvassers must continuously meet from day to day until the canvass is completed and may adjourn only to await the other election returns. The board of canvassers is a ministerial body and its power is generally limited to the mechanical function of adding or compiling the votes cast for each candidate as shown on the face of the returns before it and declaring the result. The purpose of the board of canvassers is to ascertain and declare the apparent result of the voting while all other questions are tried before the court or tribunal contesting the elections.

The Comelec Chairperson should have ensured that the suspension order was urgently released pursuant to the rules instead of contacting the PBOC members. Similarly, it would be prudent if the PBOC inquired about the veracity of the “advanced copy” of the suspension order with the Comelec Clerk of Court who is tasked to “execute orders, resolutions, decisions and processes issued by the Commission.” Indeed, the guidelines in the proclamation of winning candidates allow the ”fastest means available such as, but not limited to phone call, sending of electronic mail, etc.” of the Comelec’s action over petitions to disqualify or cancel the CoC of a candidate. But this quick measure is premised on the fact that the Comelec had duly acted on the matter. In this case, however, the Comelec En Banc Order dated May 12, 2022, came after the PBOC suspended the proclamation.

Yet, the proclamation of Roberto was ordered suspended in a proceeding where he is not a party. In election cases, the requirement of due process is satisfied if the parties are given a fair and reasonable opportunity to clarify their respective positions. In Santos v. Comelec, the Court held that candidates who have no similarity in the name of the nuisance candidate are not real parties in interest and are mere “silent observers” in the nuisance case. However, nothing in Santos allows the suspension of proclamation of these silent observers without observance of due process of law. Evidently, the suspension order directly affected Roberto being the candidate who garnered the highest number of votes and who must be proclaimed without delay. As such, the Comelec should have at the very least notified and heard Roberto. Otherwise, the proclamation of a candidate may be unjustly suspended simply because of the pendency of the nuisance case. Worse, the manner of informing the PBOC of the advance copy of the suspension order led it to motu proprio suspend Roberto’s proclamation.

These rulings are in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Specifically, the Comelec Rules of Procedure provides that “[i]n the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission, these rules and any portion thereof may be suspended by the Commission.” Here, the Comelec En Banc is deemed to have relaxed its procedures when it resolved the merits of the motion for reconsideration. In any event, the circumstances of the case merit the liberal application of the rules in the interest of substantial justice. The Comelec received Frederico’s Motion only more than an hour past 5:00 p.m. More importantly, the issue of whether Frederico is a nuisance candidate is determinative not only of the proper treatment of his votes but also as to the outcome of the elections.

As such, remedial actions should be available to alleviate the logistical hardships in the preparation and conduct of elections, whenever necessary and proper. Moreover, the Court stressed that the importance of barring nuisance candidates from participating in the electoral exercise is the avoidance of confusion and frustration in the democratic process by preventing a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate. It seeks to address the “dirty trick” employed by political rival operators to reduce the votes of the legitimate candidates due to the similarity of names and particularly benefitting from Comelec’s “slow-moving decision-making.”\n",

The law defines a political party as “an organized group of persons pursuing the same ideology, political ideas or platforms of government.” Here, NUP’s registration as a political party means it has met all the criteria under the law. The Comelec even verified NUP’s government programs and extent of constituency. Corollarily, the nomination of Frederico and his acceptance as NUP’s official candidate meant that he embodies the party’s ideals and principles which he is obliged to carry out and represent to the electorates. Indeed, Frederico enjoyed NUP’s full logistical, financial; and organizational support in his candidacy. Frederico’s lack of political experience also does not undermine his seriousness in running for public office. Absent contrary evidence, Frederico’s candidacy can hardly be considered a sham since bad faith is a factual issue that is never presumed.

Membership in a political party is not a requirement to run for senator under the current electoral framework while non-membership does not prevent a faithful determination of the will of the electorate. Also, the candidate’s degree of success is irrelevant to bona fide intention to run for public office. A candidate “has no less a right to run when he faces prospects of defeat as when he expected to win.” Neither the candidate’s act of participating for the first time in elections be equated with the absence of good faith. The Court had overruled the Comelec’s postulation that a bona fide intention to run for public office is absent if there is no “tiniest chance to obtain the favorable endorsement of a substantial portion of the electorate.” Again, it appears that the Comelec Law Department initiated actions only against De Alban and other unknown candidates without a political party, or those with low chances of winning.

Apparently, “Kuya Jan” and “Romeo” are distinct from each other. Also, with AES, the Comelec’s observation that the nicknames “Kuya Jonjon” and “Kuya Jan” are phonetically identical becomes inconsequential. The principle of “idem sonans” or the similarity in the pronunciation is irrelevant because the voters only need to shade the oval beside their chosen candidate. The claim that the voters would be confused with the candidates’ nicknames is a product of too much inference without adequate proof. To be sure, the only evidence that Romeo was known to his constituents as “Jonjon” is his COC in the 2019 elections. Yet, Romeo did not choose such nickname to appear on the ballots. Romeo consistently preferred “Romeo Jalosjos, Jr.” both in the 2019 and 2022 elections. This shows that Romeo presents himself to the voter as “Romeo” more than “Jonjon.” Besides, Romeo claimed that the nickname “Jonjon” underscores that he has the same name as his father. Thus, the voters would readily recognize “Romeo” as referring to “Jalosjos, Romeo Jr.” and not to “Jalosjos, Kuya Jan.” Further, the filing of CoCs is an integral process in the elections that permits the placing of the names of the candidates before the electorates. The CoC is an authorized badge that the voters could scrutinize details relating to the candidates before casting their ballots. In this case, the voters are deemed able to distinguish between “Romeo” and “Kuya Jan” with the filing of their CoCs. It is more prudent to conclude that the voters know whom they are voting for before casting their ballots. To hold otherwise absent proof is to speculate. Moreover, a campaign precedes the elections where the candidates can promote themselves and remove any bemusement with other contenders because of perceived similarity in their first names, nicknames, or surnames.\n",

      "Text: As discussed above, the case of Bautista held that a vote containing only the first name, nickname, or surname of a candidate would render that vote worthless in case at least two candidates have the same first name, nickname, or surname. In Zapanta v. Comelec, the identical names of two candidates appearing on the ballots made it difficult for voters to distinguish them and would prevent the faithful determination of the will of the people. On the other hand, Dela Cruz v. Comelec did not rule that mere identity in surnames of candidates is enough to declare a candidate as a nuisance. The case deals with the issue of how the votes of nuisance candidates should be treated and not the Comelec’s finding of nuisance candidacy. Also, the ruling tackles the validity of Resolution No. 8844 regarding the proper treatment of votes of all candidates who were disqualified or whose CoCs were cancelled but their names remained in the ballots. Whereas Santos v. Comelec did not authorize the declaration of a nuisance candidate because of a similar-sounding stage name. The issue is whether the Comelec may automatically credit the votes of nuisance candidates to the legitimate candidate in a multi-slot office. The writ of execution was questioned and not the declaration of nuisance candidacy.\n",

In this case, the Comelec rendered the determination of the bona fide intent to run for public office insignificant. The Comelec solely based its ruling on the alleged erroneous use of a nickname in declaring Frederico a nuisance without considering his membership in the political party, the importance of a CoC, the preceding campaign period, and the dissimilarities in the names appearing on the ballots.\n",

The proper recourse is to bring this to the attention of the Comelec as a defect of an entry in the CoC to disallow a candidate from using that nickname. The rules and regulations for the conduct of elections are mandatory before the election, but when they are sought to be enforced after the election, they are held to be directory only if that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, innocent voters will be deprived of their votes without fault on their part. Thus, even if the CoC was not duly signed or does not contain the required data, the proclamation of the candidate as the winner may not be nullified on such grounds. The defects in the certificate should have been questioned before the election; they may not be questioned after the election without invalidating the will of the electorate, which should not be done. To uphold the cancellation of Frederico’s CoC due to an erroneous use of nickname after the votes were cast would render the electorates’ votes for Frederico worthless.\n",

      "Petition for certiorari against the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated 13 May 1966 (in Criminal Case No. 82116) granting the petition for bail of therein accused Jose Simborio y Salonga on a P20,000.00 bond.\n",
      "In an information filed on 19 April 1966, Jose Simborio y Salonga was charged with the crime of murder for the fatal shooting of Avelino Concepcion, Jr. in the evening of 11 March 1966.  It was there alleged that the accused, in conspiracy with Marmolito Catelo y Rivera (alias Sonny Catelo) and others whose identity and whereabouts were unknown, shot Avelino Concepcion, Jr. with a gun, wounding the latter in the abdomen which directly and immediately caused his death (on 14 March 1966).  The offense was said to have been attended by the circumstances of premeditation, treachery, abuse of superior strength, and the use of motor vehicle.\n",
      "On 22 April 1966, the accused filed a motion for his provisional release on bail, claiming that the evidence of his guilt was not strong and, considering his personal circumstances and social standing, there is no probability that he would flee.  Thereupon, the motion was heard on 29 April 1966, during which hearing the prosecution presented its evidence, consisting of the ante mortem statement of the victim, Avelino Concepcion, Jr., given to Patrolman J. Sta. Maria at the Philippine General Hospital to the effect that accused Simborio was in the company of gunwielder Sonny Catelo when he (Concepcion) was shot; the statement of alleged eyewitness Ruben Sumalde y Olisco that when Sonny Catelo shot Concepcion, Jr. the accused was holding the victim’s left arm; and the statement of Manolito Gascon, the driver of the car used by Catelo and company, to the effect that the accused was with them at least before the incident happened.  Upon the other hand, the accused contended that at the time of the incident he was taking an examination at the Mapua Institute of Techno­logy.  To support this allegation, he presented the examination paper and the testimonies of his instructor and the latter’s assistant that the said examination paper could not have been submitted if movant did not take the test on the date in question.\n",
      "After the parties had filed their respective memoranda, the court, considering the fact that – “The prosecution admits that it was not.  Simborio who fired the gun and shot Concepcion but another suspect still at-large by the name of Sonny Catelo.  But the prosecution insists that Simborio was present, was the one who identified the victim, and was in fact holding the victim’s arm when the latter was fired upon. “In view of the claim of the accused that he was not present at the scene of the crime, but was in fact taking a final examination in the Mapua Institute of Technology at the time the alleged crime was committed, the fact of his examination paper having been produced, and the testimony of the professor that it can not happen that a student can submit an examination paper without attending the test, or that an examination paper can be submitted without the student having taken part in the examination, added to the fact that the killer and the trigger man was not Simborio but another suspect named Sonny Catelo, who is still at-large, which the prosecu­tion admits, as in fact it states in its memorandum that the principal suspects are still at-large’, which is an indirect admission that the herein accused is not as guilty as the said real principal suspects; the counter statement of the assistant to the professor, Gumangan, to the contrary notwithstanding, which in effect does not substantially alter his first affidavit because he did not have to personally know the student, but the fact remains that ‘an examination paper submitted after the examination bearing the name of Jose Simborio‘ make out a very contro­versial issue as to whether or not Simborio was present at the scene of the crime at the time”, reached the conclusion that the prosecution evidence as such does not meet the required standard of “strong evidence” to justify the denial of the accused’s right to bail.  Consequently, the petition was granted and the provisional release of the accused allowed on a bond for P20,000.00.  The Assistant City Fiscal filed the present petition, claiming that the respondent judge acted in grave abuse of discretion and with bias in issuing the aforementioned order.\n",
      "Petitioner’s charge of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent judge is premised on the allegation that the motion for bail was granted in disregard of the manifestation of the trial fiscal that he was introducing witnesses to amplify the exhibits already presented.  In short, it is here contended that in granting the petition for bail before the trial fiscal could introduce his wit­nesses, the prosecution had been deprived of its right to present complete evi­dence that would justify the disapproval of the petition, or that the order allowing the temporary liberty of the accused on bail was based on incomplete evidence.\n",
      "It can not be denied that, under our regime of laws, and concomitant with the legal presumption of innocence before conviction, an accused is entitled to provisional liberty on bail, the only exception being when he is charged with a capital offense and the evidence of his guilt is strong. But even in the latter instance, the high regard reserved by the law for personal freedom is un­derscored by the provision placing upon the prosecution, not on the defense, the burden of proving that the accused is not entitled to bail.\n",
      "This protective attitude towards the sanctity of the liberty of a person notwithstanding, due process also demands that in the matter of bail the prosecution should be afforded full opportunity to present proof of the guilt of the accused. Thus, if it were true that the prosecution in this case was deprived of the right to present its evidence against the bail petition, or that the order granting such petition was issued upon incomplete evidence, then the issuance of the order would really constitute grave abuse of discretion that would call for the remedy of certiorari.\n",
      "There is record, however, that while the trial fiscal manifested his intention to introduce witnesses to amplify the exhibits already adduced by the prosecution, such manifestation was in effect withdrawn when he offered to submit the matter for resolution of the court on the evidence already presented, provided the accused would admit said exhibits — which condition the accused accepted.  The transcript of the notes of the proceedings in the court below reads as follows:\n",
      "And there is nothing unlawful or irregular about the above procedure.  The declara­tions constitute judicial admissions, which are allowed by the rules and are binding on the parties, by virtue of which the prosecution dispensed with the in­troduction of additional evidence and the defense waived the right to contest or dispute the veracity of the statements contained in the exhibits.  Clearly, it can not be claimed that there had been deprivation of the prosecution’s right to present all its evidence.  If the evidence already adduced turned out to be inade­quate for purposes of denying the petition for bail, the prosecution can not lay the blame at anyone else’s door; it took the risk in resting its case on the exhibits already presented, which, in the lower court’s opinion, did not suffice.\n",
      "Neither is it correct to say that the respondent judge gave more credence to the alibi of the accused rather than to the statements made by the victim and an eye­witness to the incident, thereby showing bias in favor of the accused.  It must be remembered that the question raised for the determination of the lower court was not the guilt or innocence of the accused of the crime charged, but whether or not the evidence of his guilt is strong.  In taking cognizance of the fact that the state­ments of the victim and witness Sumalde, that the accused was present at the scene of the incident and even held the arm of the victim when the latter was shot at, is contradicted by the examination paper and the testimonies of the instructor and his assistant tending to establish the presence of the accused in school at the time when the shooting occurred, the respondent judge did not rule on the ad­missibility and probative value of said evidence.  It was merely held that with the issue of the whereabouts of the accused when the crime was committed having thus become contentious, the evidence of guilt of the accused (so far presented) can not be considered strong.\n",

      "On 17 June 1976, the petitioner filed an action for unlawful detainer in the City Court (now Metropolitan Trial Court) of Manila against Jesus A. Co; the complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 12235-CV and was raffled to Branch I thereof.  Petitioner alleged therein that it is the owner of a parcel of land, with a theater building named Cinema Gigi, standing thereon, located at Calle Sande, Tondo, Manila, and that Jesus Co, as lessee of the theater building, failed to pay the agreed rentals at the rate of two thousand pesos (P2,000.00) a month since 1974.  In his Answer, Jesus Co countered that it is he who owns both the lot and the theater building, having acquired the same by virtue of a sale made by the petitioner; he further avers that on 15 June 1976, he leased Cinema Gigi to herein private respondent Corazon Babao-Gonzales for a period of ten (10) years.\n",
      "During the pendency of the unlawful detainer case, particularly on 30 September 1977, Jesus A. Co filed an action “To Quite (sic) Possession, Ownership and Issuance of Title” against the petitioner in the then Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Manila.  The case involved the same property abovementioned and was docketed as Civil Case No. 105465.  A motion to dismiss the complaint was filed by the petitioner.\n",

      "In the same decision, the court ruled that petitioner is the owner of the property and that the so-called Deed of Sale by installment over it, purportedly executed by Ramon Sevilla in favor of Co, is a forgery.\n",
      "Defendant Jesus A. Co failed to appeal from this decision, thus resulting in its becoming final and executory.  On 3 November 1977, a writ of execution was issued by the City Court and served by special sheriff Jaime L. de Leon on the occupants of the property.\n",
      "On 15 November 1977, Corazon Babao-Gonzales, respondent herein, claiming to be a lessee of Jesus A. Co with respect to the subject premises, filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for “Declaratory Relief and to Vacate Judgment, Execution Order and Notice to Vacate, with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction,” against herein petitioner, Jaime de Leon, National Deputy Sheriff, and the Hon. Judge Gregorio Garcia, Presiding Judge of Branch I, City Court of Manila. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 112027.\n",

Beltran Sotto and two John Does, forcibly destroyed the chain and padlocks of the building and took possession thereof.\n",
      "The following day, 17 November 1977, in Civil Case No. 112027, Judge Pedro Cenzon issued a restraining order prohibiting petitioner from reacquiring possession of the subject premises.  Petitioner filed a motion to lift the restraining order.  A hearing was thereafter conducted on said motion and Gonzales’ application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.\n",

      "“a.  The issuance of the writ of execution was based on a final judgment of the City Court of Manila, Branch I, in Civil Case No. 12235-CV entitled ‘Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. versus Jesus Co, for ejectment.  This judgment has not been set aside in any proceeding as null and void.\n",
      "b.  The writ of execution was duly served by the respondent sheriff, implemented and completed.  The possession of the premises in question has been turned over to the possession of the private respondent, Ramon Sevilla, by the respondent sheriff as per Exhibit 8.\n",
      "c.  If the petitioner (Corazon Babao-­Gonzales) is now in physical possession of the premises in question, such physical possession is a mere interference or disturbance of the possession of the private respondent (Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc.) after he (sic) acquired it when the respondent sheriff delivered the premises to him (sic) in compliance with the writ of execution.  There is nothing to restrain.  There (sic) respondent City Court judge has already ordered execution of the judgment and the respondent sheriff has already carried out the order and placed the private respondent in possession of the premises in question.\n",
      "d.  The petitioner is herself a wrong doer when she interferred (sic) with the possession of the private respondent after it was given to him (sic) by the respondent sheriff.\n",
      "e.  The petitioner has failed to established (sic) a clear or positive right over the property in question.  Her socalled (sic) right is predicated on a contract of lease between herself and Jesus Co as the lessor-owner of the property.  But the ownership of Jesus Co on the property is based on a Deed of Sale by installment which the PC Crime Laboratory, Camp Crame, Quezon City, has declared to be a forgery.  Likewise, the very notary public who allegedly notarized this document it (sic) to be a fake.  In short, the right of the petitioner on (sic) the property in question is not in essee or ‘in being’ up to this hour.\n",
      "f.  The existence of Civil Case No. 10465 (sic) entitled ‘Jesus Altavano Co vs. the Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, represented by Ramon Sevilla’ in Branch IX of this Court where the issue is allegedly one of ownership, will not be rendered moot and academic by the denial of a writ of preliminary injunction by this Branch of the Court.  If Jesus Altavano Co, the plaintiff in that case will be declared the owner of the property in question, then its possession will go with his ownership.  But the final judgment of the City Court, Branch I, in the ejectment case should be, as it was, executed, because it is a valid decision until declared otherwise in a proper proceedings (sic).  Importantly, the petitioner did not intervene in Civil Case No. 12235 of Branch I of the City Court of Manila.”\n",
      "On 9 February 1978, petitioner herein filed a motion praying that Gonzales and her counsel be held guilty of indirect contempt and be ordered to vacate the Cinema Gigi.  Acting thereon, Judge Jose B. Herrera issued on 8 March 1978 an Order directing “Deputy Sheriff Jaime de Leon, who may avail himself (sic) of the assistance of any law enforcement agency, to eject the defendant Jesus A. Co and all other persons claiming right (sic) under him from the premises of Cine GIGI situated at Calle Sande St., Tondo, Manila, and to restore plaintiff to the possession thereof.”\n",
      "Her motion to reconsider the Order of Judge Pedro Cenzon in Civil Case No. 112027 of 25 January 1978 having been denied, herein private respondent Babao-Gonzales filed with the respondent Court on 25 May 1978 “a Petition for Review with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Damages,” docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. SP-07822-R.  In the said petition, private respondent claimed that she has a better right to possess the subject premises and prayed, inter alia, that a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction be issued to restore her to the possession of the questioned premises.  On 2 November 1978, the respondent Court rendered a decision setting aside the 25 January 1978 Order of Judge Pedro Cenzon and ordering Sheriff Jaime de Leon to restore respondent Corazon Babao-Gonzales to the possession of the questioned premises upon the filing of a bond to answer for any and all damages that may be suffered by petitioner corporation. In granting the petition, respondent Court relied on the following arguments:\n",
      "“We find merit in the instant petition.  In the first place, it is a fact that petitioner Corazon Babao Gonzales is not a sub-lessee of Jesus Altavano Co but a lessee in which case she cannot come under the term ‘persons claiming under him’.  Secondly, in the ejectment case (Civil Case No. 12235-CV), the defendant was Jesus A. Co only.  To enforce the judgment in said ejectment case against herein petitioner Corazon Babao Gonzales would indeed be violative of the constitutional provision regarding the due process clause.  Thirdly, the action to quiet title instituted by Jesus Altavao (sic) Co vs. Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. (Civil Case No. 105465) is still pending trial before the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch IX.  It was not within the competence of the City Court in the ejectment suit to say that the true owner of the property are the Heirs of Eugenio Sevilla, Inc. because the sale in favor of Jesus Altavano Co was a forgery.  This matter is within the competence and jurisdiction of the court of first instance and precisely that is the issue in said Civil Case 105465.  x x x We believe it would be more prudent to maintain the status quo of the parties and for the respondent sheriff and his duly authorized representatives and agents to desist from enforcing the writ of execution issued by the City Court of Manila in Civil Case No. 0-12235-CV against Corazon Babao Gonzales until the court of first instance has decided the action to quiet possession, ownership and possession of title.”\n",
      "Its motion for reconsideration of the above decision having been denied, petitioner filed the instant petition on 2 March 1979.\n",
      "On 9 March 1979, this Court required respondent to comment on the petition within ten (10) days from receipt of notice.\n",
      "However, before respondent could submit its Comment, petitioner, on 13 March 1979, filed a supplemental petition apprising this Court of the fact that Civil Case No. 105465, the action for Quieting of Title before the Court of First Instance of Manila, was dismissed on the ground of res judicata by said court in the Order handed down on 26 February 1979. Co appealed the Order to the Court of Appeals, which was docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R.\n",
      "Private respondent subsequently submitted both her comment to the petition and comment to the supplemental petition.\n",
      "This Court resolved to give due course to the petition and required both parties to submit their respective Memoranda simultaneously, which they complied with.\n",
      "On 2 March 1987, this Court required both parties to manifest whether they are still interested in prosecuting this case.\n",
      "Petitioner manifested on 30 March 1987 that it is still interested in prosecuting the case; it likewise informed this Court that Co’s appeal (C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R) was dismissed by the respondent Court of Appeals on 5 May 1981, as “evidenced by the Court of Appeals’ entry of judgment dated 24 May 1981.” The dismissal was based on Co’s failure to file the record on appeal.\n",
      "In this petition, petitioner raises the following issues:\n",
      "“Whether the City Court of Manila has the jurisdiction to pass upon the issue of ownership in an ejectment case brought before it. \n",
      "Whether certiorari, petition for review, or appeal to the Court of Appeals is the proper remedy against, a final order or decision of the Court of First Instance in a petition for Declaratory Relief. \n",
      "Whether a writ of execution in an action for illegal detainer is enforceable against an occupant who claims to be a lessee of the party ordered ejected therefrom.”\n",
      "This petition is impressed with merit.\n",
      "Since the first two (2) issues have become moot and academic in view of the dismissal of Jesus Co’s appeal, C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R, We shall focus our discussion on the third issue.\n",
      "To recapitulate, the decision in the unlawful detainer case, Civil Case No. 12235-CV, wherein the court held that the petitioner is the owner of the subject premises, the so-called deed of sale on installment upon which Co based his claim of ownership is a forgery and Co is a mere lessee thereof, had long become final and had in fact been executed.  Also, Co’s action for Quieting of Title, Civil Case No. 105465, filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila, was dismissed on the ground that, the cause of action is barred by prior judgment.  The dismissal had likewise become final because Co’s appeal (C.A.-G.R. No. 67454-R) to the Court of Appeals was dismissed and entry of judgment was made on 24 May 1981.\n",
      "In view of the above final decision and order, herein private respondent cannot claim any better right than Mr. Co.\n",
      "In Jorge vs. Consolasion, this Court held: “The petitioners, as mere lessees of the losing party, have no rights whatsoever to claim and to be protected by the mantle of the law and neither do they have the right to intervene and/or block the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 1160.”\n",
      "Furthermore, private respondent was in reality a mere sublessee.  It is a well settled rule in this jurisdiction that “the sublessee … can invoke no right superior to that of his sublessor.” In Guevara Realty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, We held:\n",
      "“‘A Judgment of eviction against a lessee affects his sub-lessees, even if the latter are not sued in the ejectment case.  This is so, because a sublessee can invoke no right superior to that of his sublessor, and the moment the latter is duly ousted from the premises, the former has no leg to stand on.  The sublessees’ right, if any, is to demand reparation for damages from his sublessor, should the latter be at fault.  The sublessees can only assert such right of possession as could have been granted them by their sublessor, their right of possession depending entirely upon that of the latter.’ (Tolentino, Civil Code of the Philippines, Vol. 5, pp. 194-195, citing the cases of Ng Sui Tan v. Amparo, 80 Phil 921; Go King v. Geronimo, 81 Phil. 445; Sipin v. Court of First Instance of Manila, 74 Phil. 650; Madrigal v. Ang Sam To, et al., 46 Off. Gas. 2173).”\n",
      "Hence, even if respondent was not made a party in the unlawful detainer case, the judgment evicting Jesus Co is equally binding on her, contrary to her contention.\n",
      "WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.  The assailed decision of the respondent Court of Appeals in C.A-G.R. SP-07822-R is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the Order of the trial court of 25 January 1978 in Civil Case No. 112027 is REINSTATED.\n",
