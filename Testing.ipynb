As such, the issues raised in the Petitions partake the nature of an election contest within the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). Assuming the Court may decide the case, the OSG maintained that there was no violation of due process because Roberto is not a real party in interest in SPA No. 21-224 (DC). Also, the OSG asserted that the Comelec aptly denied Fredericoâs Motion for Reconsideration because it was filed out of time. The Comelec rules provide that a pleading sent via electronic mail beyond 5:00 p.m. is deemed filed the following day. Yet, Frederico submitted his Motion through electronic mail at 6:23 p.m. On the merits, the OSG argued that the Comelec correctly held that Frederico is a nuisance candidate because his choice of the moniker âKuya Janâ is confusingly similar to Romeoâs nickname âKuya Jonjonâ and has the potential to mislead the voters. Thus, the Comelec properly applied the Dela Cruz ruling that the votes received by a nuisance candidate should be credited to the legitimate candidate with the same surname.

In this case, it must be pointed out that Romeoâs proclamation as the winner is dependent on Comelecâs declaration of Frederico as a nuisance candidate. Unless the Comelec resolution is set aside, Romeo will be considered the winner because the votes of Frederico are presumed to be votes for Romeo. It is the Court, not the HRET, that is the proper body to review a Comelec Resolution. The HRET cannot declare a nuisance candidate and cancel a candidateâs CoC.

It cannot be said that Romeo became a member of the House of Representatives by âoperation of lawâ pursuant to Article VI, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution. The theory on âassumption by operation of lawâ which coincides on June 30 following the election is an over-stretched interpretation of the constitutional provision. The language of the provision is about the commencement of the term of office of âMembersâ which shall begin âat noon on the thirtieth day of June next following their elections.â This provision likewise sets the rule on term limitation such that â[n]o member of the House of Representatives shall serve for more than three consecutive terms.â However, the term of office refers to a fixed duration which is not analogous to assumption of office that pertains to overt acts in the discharge of oneâs duties. Also, the term of office commences on June 30 following the elections, unlike the assumption of office which may transpire at a different time. Verily, assumption of office cannot be constructive but must involve actual discharge of duties. As discussed above, Romeoâs failure to take an oath before the Speaker of the House bars him from performing hit functions and participating in the deliberations. The proposed theory on âassumption by operation of lawâ will also effectively remove Article 234 of the Revised Penal Code which punishes the crime of refusal to discharge elective office which states that â[t]he penalty of arresto mayor or a fine not exceeding 1,000 pesos, or both, shall be imposed upon any person who, having been elected by popular election to a public office, shall refuse without legal motive to be sworn in or to discharge the duties of said office.â Differently stated, no person elected by popular election to public office may be charged and convicted of this crime after June 30 following the election since he or she is deemed to have assumed office by operation of law. Again, it is basic in statutory construction that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence â interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi.\n",

To hold that Roberto should be proclaimed in the interim is to defeat the very purpose of issuing the Status Quo Ante Order without the Court resolving the issues raised in these Petitions.

The status quo order was thus issued motu proprio on equitable considerations. Also, unlike a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, a status quo order is more in the nature of a cease and desist order, since it neither directs the doing or undoing of acts as in the case of prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief.

Yet, the proclamation of Roberto was ordered suspended in a proceeding where he is not a party. In election cases, the requirement of due process is satisfied if the parties are given a fair and reasonable opportunity to clarify their respective positions. In Santos v. Comelec, the Court held that candidates who have no similarity in the name of the nuisance candidate are not real parties in interest and are mere âsilent observersâ in the nuisance case. However, nothing in Santos allows the suspension of proclamation of these silent observers without observance of due process of law. Evidently, the suspension order directly affected Roberto being the candidate who garnered the highest number of votes and who must be proclaimed without delay. As such, the Comelec should have at the very least notified and heard Roberto. Otherwise, the proclamation of a candidate may be unjustly suspended simply because of the pendency of the nuisance case. Worse, the manner of informing the PBOC of the advance copy of the suspension order led it to motu proprio suspend Robertoâs proclamation.

These rulings are in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice.

The law defines a political party as âan organized group of persons pursuing the same ideology, political ideas or platforms of government.â Here, NUPâs registration as a political party means it has met all the criteria under the law. The Comelec even verified NUPâs government programs and extent of constituency. Corollarily, the nomination of Frederico and his acceptance as NUPâs official candidate meant that he embodies the partyâs ideals and principles which he is obliged to carry out and represent to the electorates. Indeed, Frederico enjoyed NUPâs full logistical, financial; and organizational support in his candidacy. Fredericoâs lack of political experience also does not undermine his seriousness in running for public office. Absent contrary evidence, Fredericoâs candidacy can hardly be considered a sham since bad faith is a factual issue that is never presumed.

Membership in a political party is not a requirement to run for senator under the current electoral framework while non-membership does not prevent a faithful determination of the will of the electorate. Also, the candidateâs degree of success is irrelevant to bona fide intention to run for public office. A candidate âhas no less a right to run when he faces prospects of defeat as when he expected to win.â Neither the candidateâs act of participating for the first time in elections be equated with the absence of good faith. The Court had overruled the Comelecâs postulation that a bona fide intention to run for public office is absent if there is no âtiniest chance to obtain the favorable endorsement of a substantial portion of the electorate.â Again, it appears that the Comelec Law Department initiated actions only against De Alban and other unknown candidates without a political party, or those with low chances of winning.

Also, with AES, the Comelecâs observation that the nicknames âKuya Jonjonâ and âKuya Janâ are phonetically identical becomes inconsequential. The principle of âidem sonansâ or the similarity in the pronunciation is irrelevant because the voters only need to shade the oval beside their chosen candidate. The claim that the voters would be confused with the candidatesâ nicknames is a product of too much inference without adequate proof. To be sure, the only evidence that Romeo was known to his constituents as âJonjonâ is his COC in the 2019 elections. Yet, Romeo did not choose such nickname to appear on the ballots. Romeo consistently preferred âRomeo Jalosjos, Jr.â both in the 2019 and 2022 elections. This shows that Romeo presents himself to the voter as âRomeoâ more than âJonjon.â Besides, Romeo claimed that the nickname âJonjonâ underscores that he has the same name as his father. Thus, the voters would readily recognize âRomeoâ as referring to âJalosjos, Romeo Jr.â and not to âJalosjos, Kuya Jan.â Further, the filing of CoCs is an integral process in the elections that permits the placing of the names of the candidates before the electorates. The CoC is an authorized badge that the voters could scrutinize details relating to the candidates before casting their ballots. In this case, the voters are deemed able to distinguish between âRomeoâ and âKuya Janâ with the filing of their CoCs. It is more prudent to conclude that the voters know whom they are voting for before casting their ballots. To hold otherwise absent proof is to speculate.

The rules and regulations for the conduct of elections are mandatory before the election, but when they are sought to be enforced after the election, they are held to be directory only if that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, innocent voters will be deprived of their votes without fault on their part. Thus, even if the CoC was not duly signed or does not contain the required data, the proclamation of the candidate as the winner may not be nullified on such grounds. The defects in the certificate should have been questioned before the election; they may not be questioned after the election without invalidating the will of the electorate, which should not be done. To uphold the cancellation of Fredericoâs CoC due to an erroneous use of nickname after the votes were cast would render the electoratesâ votes for Frederico worthless.\n",

      "Text: The Court reminds that the use of wrong, irrelevant, and insufficient considerations in deciding an issue taints a decision makerâs action with grave abuse of discretion. A judgment rendered with grave abuse of discretion is void and cannot be the source of any right or obligation. All acts pursuant to such decision and all claims .emanating from it have no legal effect. A void judgment can never become final and any writ of execution based on it is likewise void. In sum, the Comelec committed grave abuse of discretion in canceling Fredericoâs CoC absent supporting substantial evidence that he is a nuisance candidate. Frederico is a legitimate candidate and the votes he received are all valid. There is no more question as to the proper treatment of his votes. Consequently, these findings rendered moot the issue of whether the votes in favor of a nuisance candidate should be declared stray or must be credited to the legitimate candidate with the same surname.\n",
