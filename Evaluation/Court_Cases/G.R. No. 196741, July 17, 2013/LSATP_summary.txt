FACTS:


ISSUES:
The sole issue for the Court’s resolution is whether or not the respondents may be lawfully ejected from the subject property.

RULINGS:
Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the January 11, 2011 Decision and April 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 03888 which declared respondent Marcosa A. Sabandal-Herzenstiel (Sabandal-Herzenstiel) as the lawful possessor of Lot No. 2574, situated in Brgy. Basdiot, Moalboal, Cebu (subject property). On April 13, 2007, the MCTC rendered a Decision (MCTC Decision) ordering respondents to: (a) vacate the subject property and remove all the improvements introduced therein; (b) pay petitioner, jointly and severally, the amount of P2,000.00 as monthly rental from the date of judicial demand, i.e., March 18, 1998, until they have effectively vacated the premises; and (c) pay the costs of suit. On January 30, 2008, respondents’ appeal to the RTC was dismissed for their failure to file a memorandum on appeal as required under Section 7(b), Rule 40 of the Rules of Court (Rules). Their motion for reconsideration was similarly denied in an Order dated April 23, 2008. The CA RulingOn January 11, 2011, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, nullifying and setting aside the rulings of both the MCTC and RTC, and declaring Sabandal-Herzenstiel as the lawful possessor of the subject property. Petitioner moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution dated April 14, 2011. The petition is meritorious. In an action for forcible entry, the plaintiff must prove that he was in prior possession of the disputed property and that the defendant deprived him of his possession by any of the means provided for in Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules, namely: force, intimidation, threats, strategy, and stealth. And in David v. Cordova: Similarly, in Arbizo v. Santillan, it has been held that the acts of unlawfully entering the disputed premises, erecting a structure thereon, and excluding therefrom the prior possessor would necessarily imply the use of force, as in this case. In fine, the Court upholds the findings and conclusions of the MCTC, adjudging petitioner to be the lawful possessor of the subject property, square as they are with existing law and jurisprudence. Accordingly, the CA’s ruling on the merits must perforce be reversed and set aside. WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The January 11, 2011 Decision and April 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, in CA-G.R. SP No. 03888 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The April 13, 2007 Decision of the 12th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Moalboal-Alcantara-Badian-Alegria, Cebu in Civil Case No. 118 is REINSTATED.
