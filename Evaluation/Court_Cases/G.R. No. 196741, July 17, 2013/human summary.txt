FACTS:
Petitioner Philippine Tourism Authority (now Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority) is the owner of the subject property and other parcels of land since February 12, 1981 when it bought the same from Tri-Island Corporate Holdings, Inc. Sometime in 1997, however, respondents Pedro Tapales, Luis Tapales, Romeo Tapales and Sabandal-Herzenstiel by force, strategy and stealth entered the subject property, on which they proceeded to cut down some coconut trees, introduced improvements and fenced the area. Petitioner made demands to vacate, which respondents ignored, prompting the filing of a forcible entry complaint against them. 

ISSUES:
Whether or not the respondents may be lawfully ejected from the subject property.

RULINGS:
Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals, which declared respondent Marcosa A. Sabandal-Herzenstiel (Sabandal-Herzenstiel) as the lawful possessor of Lot No. 2574. In an action for forcible entry, the plaintiff must prove that he was in prior possession of the disputed property and that the defendant deprived him of his possession by any of the means provided for in Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules, namely: force, intimidation, threats, strategy, and stealth. Respondents failed to establish their prior and continued possession of the subject property after its sale in favor of petitioner in 1981. On the contrary, they even admitted in their answer to the complaint that petitioner exercised dominion over the same by instituting caretakers and leasing portions thereof to third persons. WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The January 11, 2011 Decision and April 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, in CA-G.R. SP No. 03888 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The April 13, 2007 Decision of the 12th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Moalboal-Alcantara-Badian-Alegria, Cebu in Civil Case No. 118 is REINSTATED.
