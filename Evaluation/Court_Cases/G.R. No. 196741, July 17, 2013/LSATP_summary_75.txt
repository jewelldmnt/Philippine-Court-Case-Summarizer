ISSUES:
The RTC Ruling

RULINGS:
In their Answer with Counterclaim the Tapaleses acknowledged that the subject property had already been sold by its administrator Josefina Abrenica to Tri-Island. They however claimed that the sale was tainted with force and intimidation and hence void including the subsequent transactions covering the same property. Notwithstanding the sale they remained in actual and physical possession of the subject property and even introduced improvements thereon. Consequently absent any proof of prior possession on the part of petitioner they claimed that the forcible entry complaint must necessarily be dismissed. The MCTC Ruling On April 13 2007 the MCTC rendered a Decision MCTC Decision ordering respondents to: a vacate the subject property and remove all the improvements introduced therein; b pay petitioner jointly and severally the amount of P2 000.00 as monthly rental from the date of judicial demand March 18 1998 until they have effectively vacated the premises; and c pay the costs of suit. On January 30 2008 respondent appeal to the RTC was dismissed for their failure to file a memorandum on appeal as required under Section 7 b Rule 40 of the Rules of Court Rules . Their motion for reconsideration was similarly denied in an Order dated April 23 2008. Only Sabandal-Herzenstiel elevated the matter before the CA via a petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules. The CA RulingOn January 11 2011 the CA rendered the assailed Decision nullifying and setting aside the rulings of both the MCTC and RTC and declaring Sabandal-Herzenstiel as the lawful possessor of the subject property. It held that while the RTC correctly dismissed respondent appeal for failure to submit their memorandum on appeal within the prescribed period it should have relaxed the rules on procedure in the interest of substantial justice and for a full determination of the rights of the parties taking into account the subsequent compliance of the respondents. Petitioner moved for reconsideration which was however denied in a Resolution dated April 14 2011. In this case respondents failed to establish their prior and continued possession of the subject property after its sale in favor of petitioner in 1981. On the contrary they even admitted in their answer to the complaint that petitioner exercised dominion over the same by instituting caretakers and leasing portions thereof to third persons. Suffice it to state that possession in the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to have his feet on every square meter of the ground before he is deemed in possession. Thus finding petitioner assertion to be well-founded the MCTC properly adjudged petitioner to have prior possession over the subject property as against Sabandal-Herzenstiel who never claimed ownership or possession thereof.
