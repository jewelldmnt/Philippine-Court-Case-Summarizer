Accused-appellant Marlon Belmonte y Sumagit assails the Decision dated April 22 2014 of the Court of Appeals CA in CA-CR-HC No. 05774 affirming his conviction for Robbery with Rape in Criminal Case No. 135982- The Facts Accused-appellant and his co-accused namely Marvin Belmonte Marvin Enrile Gabay Enrile and Noel Baac Noel were charged with Robbery with Rape in an Information dated September 3 2007 that reads: The Prosecution through the undersigned Public Prosecutor charges Marlon Belmonte y Sumagit Marvin Belmonte y Sumagit and Enrile Gabay y Dela Torre @ Puno with the crime of robbery with rape committed as follows: On or about September 1 2007 in Pasig City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above accused armed with a gun conspiring and confederating together with one Noel Baac who is still at-large and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another with intent to gain and by means of force violence and intimidation did then and there willfully unlawfully and feloniously take steal and divest from complainants the following to wit: And on the occasion thereof said Noel Baac by means of force threats and intimidation and with the use of a gun willfully unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with AAA against her will and consent which is aggravated by the circumstances of nighttime and dwelling to the damage and prejudice of the said victim. The trial of the case proceeded against the accused-appellant his cohorts Marvin and Enrile who all pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. However Noel remained at large. The prosecution evidence established that in the evening of August 31 2007 Hiroshi Emmanuel Zorilla Hiroshi celebrated his 17th birthday with his friends in the house of his aunt Teodora and uncle Robert Dela Cruz in Pasig City. When it was already 12:00 midnight Jolly Pantaleon Jolly one of Hiroshi friends who was present at the celebration left the group to buy some beer from a nearby store. At the store Jolly met Enrile who asked him if he could join them in the drinking spree at Hiroshi place. Enrile then helped Jolly carry the half case of beer and joined in the drinking spree at Hiroshi house. At around 2:00 of September 1 2007 Jolly left the group and was followed by Enrile but the latter soon returned to the party and was accompanied by accused-appellant and his brother Marvin and Noel. Armed with guns and a knife the three men approached and suddenly boxed Enrile then tied the hands of all the persons inside the house and ordered them to lie down on the floor as they took their personal belongings. Meanwhile the maids of spouses Teodora and Robert namely AAA and Rhea Brioso were awakened inside their quarters by the presence of two men later identified as accused-appellant and Noel. Upon Noel order AAA was left inside the room. Noel immediately locked the door and at gunpoint ordered AAA to remove her pants. He told AAA to lie down then he inserted his penis into her vagina. Thereafter Noel and Marvin entered the room of spouses Teodora and Robert through the window. Teodora was awakened and was surprised hence she shouted which prompted Robert to get up from bed. At gunpoint Noel and Marvin ordered the spouses to lie on the bed while they searched the room; then they took away some pieces of jewelry laptop ATM card cash amounting to PhP 6 700 and 23 pieces of Yen. Teodora recognized the faces of Noel and Marvin since the room was illuminated by light coming from a lamp shade. For his part Enrile testified that at around 1:00 of September 1 2007 he and other bystanders were in front of bakery store about four streets away from Hiroshi house when Jolly arrived to buy one and a half cases of beer. He helped Jolly carry the cases of beer upon the latter request and when they arrived at Hiroshi house he was asked to join in the drinking session. Thereafter some men entered the house and suddenly ordered them to lie down on the floor and tied their hands. The men took away his jewelry and cellular phone. Accused-appellant and Marvin on the other hand proffered alibi and claimed that they were sleeping in their house when the alleged crime was committed. After trial the RTC convicted accused-appellant Marvin and Enrile of the crime of Robbery with Rape thus: 1 Accused-appellant Enrile Gabay y Dela Torre is acquitted on ground of reasonable doubt Unless detained for some other lawful reasons accused-appellant Enrile Gabay y Dela Torre is hereby ordered released immediately. AAA testimony was straightforward candid and consistent on material points detailing the bestial act of accused Noel Baac in ravishing her. Besides her statement was corroborated by the medical certificate dated September 7 2007 finding AAA genitals to have suffered from deep fresh laceration. No young and decent woman in her right mind especially of tender age as that of AAA who is 18 years old would concoct a story of defloration allow the examination of her private parts and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to a public trial if she was not motivated solely by her desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her. On the face of the evidence against him accused-appellant defense consisting merely of his bare allegation that he and his brother Marvin were at their house when the crime was committed does not persuade Us to rule in his favor. By their own admission they live at 97 Eastbank Road Kapitbahayan Floodway Sta. Lucia Pasig City. It was easy for them to negotiate the distance between their house and the victim house. Their place of residence and the place where the crime was committed are both situated in Barangay Sta. Lucia and the distance could be negotiated within 15 minutes. Ergo his conviction is sustained. Civil indemnity ï¿½ PhP 100 000.00
