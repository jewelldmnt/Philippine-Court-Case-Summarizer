FACTS:
For its defense the Province of Cebu admitted the existence of the additional works but maintained that there was no contract between it and WTCI therefor. It also claimed that the additional works did not undergo public bidding as required by Republic Act No. RA 9184 otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act. Upon joint verification by the parties the value of the additional works was pegged at P263 263 261.41. Dissatisfied the Province of Cebu appealed to the CA. The Issues Before the Court The issues for the resolution of the Court are: a whether or not the liability of the Province of Cebu is in the nature of a loan or forbearance of money; and b whether or not the interest due should be computed from the date of the filing of the complaint or from the time extrajudicial demand was made. The Court Ruling Coming now to the issue of whether the RTC and the CA erred in computing the interest due WTCI from the time of the filing of the complaint the Court finds merit in WTCI argument that the same should be reckoned from the time WTCI made the extrajudicial demand for the payment of the principal upon receipt of the Province of Cebu of WTCI February 8 2007 and February 12 2007 letters demanding payment for the additional structural and architectural works and additional electrical and plumbing works respectively. The Court observes however that WTCI neither appealed from nor sought a reconsideration of the May 20 2009 Judgment of the RTC which awarded interest to it computed from the time of the filing of the complaint on January 22 2008. Accordingly the RTC determination of the interest reckoning point had already become final as against WTCI since it was not one of the assigned errors considered on appeal. It is settled that a decision becomes final as against a party who does not appeal the same. Consequently the present petition of WTCI questioning the RTC determination on the reckoning point of the legal interest awarded can no longer be given due course. The Court is therefore constrained to uphold the rulings of the RTC and the CA that the legal interest shall be computed from the time of the filing of the complaint.

RULINGS:
Sometime in 2005 the Province of Cebu was chosen by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to host the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN Summit scheduled on December 10 2006. To cater to the event it decided to construct the Cebu International Convention Center CICC or the project at the New Mandaue Reclamation Area Mandaue City Cebu which would serve as venue for the ASEAN Summit. Accordingly the Province of Cebu conducted a public bidding for the project and on February 22 2006 WTCI emerged as the winning bidder for the construction of Phase I thereof which consists of the substructure of CICC. On July 26 2006 after completing Phase I and receiving payment therefor WTCI again won the bidding for Phase II of the project involving the adjacent works on CICC. As Phase II neared completion the Province of Cebu caused WTCI to perform additional works on the project which included site development and additional structural architectural electric and plumbing works additional works . Cognizant of the need to complete the project in time for the ASEAN Summit and with the repeated assurances that it would be promptly paid WTCI agreed to perform the additional works notwithstanding the lack of public bidding. In November 2006 weeks before the scheduled ASEAN Summit WTCI completed the project including the additional works and accordingly demanded payment therefor. In a letter dated February 8 2007 WTCI billed the Province of Cebu the amount of P175 951 478.69 corresponding to the added cost for the site development and extended structural and architectural works. In a separate letter dated February 12 2007 WTCI billed the Province of Cebu the amount of P85 266 407.97 representing the cost for the additional electrical and plumbing works. The Province of Cebu however refused to pay thereby prompting WTCI to send a Final Billing dated February 21 2007 where it demanded payment of the aggregate sum of P261 217 886.66. In the letters dated March 20 2007 and September 11 2007 WTCI again reiterated its demand for payment but the Province of Cebu still refused to pay. Thus on January 22 2008 WTCI filed a complaint for collection of sum of money before the RTC which was docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-34012. In a Judgment dated May 20 2009 the RTC ruled in favor of WTCI and ordered the Province of Cebu to pay the following amounts: a P263 263 261.41 representing the cost of the additional works with legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum computed from the filing of the complaint on January 22 2008 until fully paid; b P50 000.00 as attorney fees; and c costs of suit. The RTC found that there was a perfected oral contract between the parties for the additional works on CICC and that WTCI must be duly compensated therefor under the doctrine of quantum meruit; otherwise the Province of Cebu would be unjustly enriched. The Province of Cebu sought a reconsideration of the foregoing and argued that its valuation of the additional works was only P257 413 911.73. Further it maintained that it was not liable to pay interests as WTCI performed the additional works at its own risk given that there was no public bidding. WTCI on the other hand neither filed an appeal nor a motion for reconsideration of the May 20 2009 Judgment of the RTC. In an Order dated September 22 2009 the RTC granted in part the motion for reconsideration and reduced the amount of actual damages from P263 263 261.41 to P257 413 911.73 in accordance with the cost standards for the year 2006 provided by the Commission on Audit COA the National Statistics Office NSO the Department of Trade and Industry DTI and the Province of Cebu itself. On all other points including the award of 12% legal interest from the filing of the complaint as well as the award of attorney fees and costs of suit the RTC sustained its earlier ruling. On January 24 2013 the Province of Cebu moved for reconsideration which was however denied by the CA in a Resolution dated August 8 2013. WTCI on the other hand did not seek for a reconsideration of the CA December 19 2012 Decision but filed on November 13 2013 a petition for review on certiorari before this Court docketed as No. 208984. In said petition WTCI maintained that the obligation is one for forbearance of money since its performance of the additional works was a mere financial accommodation to the Province of Cebu thereby warranting the imposition of legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum as originally decreed by the RTC. It further claimed that the interest should be computed from the date of extrajudicial demand from the date of receipt of the Province of Cebu of its February 8 and 12 2007 billing letters. On November 13 2013 the Province of Cebu filed its own petition for review on certiorari before this Court docketed as No. 209245. It contended that there was no perfected contract between the parties and that even if there was the same is void for lack of public bidding as required under RA 9184. While it admitted paying P257 413 911.73 to WTCI the Province of Cebu averred that it did so only under the principle of quantum meruit adding too that it could not be held liable for interest attorney fees and costs of suit because there was no valid contract and that at any rate even if it wanted to pay WTCI sooner it could not do so owing to the lack of documentation.
