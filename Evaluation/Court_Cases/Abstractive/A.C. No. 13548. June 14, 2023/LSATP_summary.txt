FACTS:
Complainant claims that she is one of the heirs of Adela Espiritu-­Barlaan, who died intestate on September 4, 2010, leaving no descendant or ascendant, but with brothers and sisters. Adela Espiritu-Barlaan also left a parcel of land with an area of 247 square meters, registered under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 2133 with Free Patent No. MT-007-602-94-2003 located in Pembo, Makati City (subject property). By virtue of the Extrajudicial Settlement with Waiver and Transfer of Rights, OCT No. 2133 was cancelled and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 006-2014001250 was issued in the name of John Alexander Barlaan. Thereafter, John Alexander Barlaan sold 147 square meters of the subject property to Monette Abac Ramos for P3,130,000.00 as evinced by the Deed of Absolute Sale dated November 26, 2014 (First Deed of Sale). The First Deed of Sale was acknowledged before and notarized by respondent in his notarial book. Monette Abac Ramos then filed a Complaint for Ejectment dated May 12, 2015 after discovering that the 147-square meter property she bought from John Alexander Barlaan was occupied by other relatives of Adela Espiritu-Barlaan (the original owner of the subject property). Attached to the Complaint was her Judicial Affidavit, where she narrated that, as shown by the First Deed of Sale, she bought the 147-square meter property from John Alexander Barlaan for P3,130,000.00. RESOLUTION NO. CBD-XXV-2021-08-32CBD Case No. 17-5424Celia D. Mendoza vs.Atty. Cesar R.

RULINGS:
To recall, respondent never disputed that he notarized the First and Second Deeds of Sale, corresponding to the exact same property, but indicating different amounts. In this regard, it is worthy to note that in Monette Abac Ramos’ Judicial Affidavit submitted in the ejectment case before the MeTC, she categorically stated that she bought the property for P3,130,000.00 as evinced by the First Deed of Sale, which was acknowledged before and notarized by respondent. However, as borne by the records, what was submitted to the Registry of Deeds of Makati City was the Second Deed of Sale – also acknowledged before and notarized by respondent – indicating the amount of P1,500,000.00, which amount became the basis of the tax liability of respondent’s client. Undeniably, and as pointed out by the IBP-CBD, respondent’s act of notarizing the First and Second Deeds of Sale was for the purpose of minimizing his client’s liability from paying taxes. Based on Delos Santos’ testimony, respondent told her that he drafted and notarized another instrument that did not state the true consideration of the sale, in order to reduce the capital gains tax due on the transaction. Respondent cannot escape liability for making an untruthful statement in a public document for an unlawful purpose. As the second deed indicated an amount lower than the actual price paid for the property sold, respondent abetted in depriving the Government of the right to collect the correct taxes due. Respondent violated Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the CPR, to wit: The act of notarization is imbued with substantive public interest wherein a private document is converted into a public document, which results in the document’s admissibility in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. It is the notary public’s duty to observe utmost care in complying with the formalities intended to protect the integrity of the notarized document and the act or acts it embodies. x x x Aside from the duty of the notary public to ascertain the identity of the affiant and the voluntariness of the declaration, it is also incumbent upon him to guard against any illegal or immoral arrangement or at least refrain from being a party to its consummation. Rule IV, Section 4 (a) of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice prohibits notaries public from performing any notarial act for transactions similar to the subject deeds of sale, x x x We ruled that the Court may suspend or disbar a lawyer for any misconduct showing any fault or deficiency in his moral character, honesty, probity or good demeanor. As regards his suspension from the practice of law, we hold that neither the one-year suspension imposed in Gonzales and in the other cases, nor the six-month suspension recommended by the IBP Board of Governors, is applicable to this case. The one-year and the six-month suspension from the practice of law are not commensurate to the graveness of the respondent’s transgressions. Thus, with respect to respondent’s suspension from the practice of law, we hold that respondent’s failure to faithfully comply with the rules on notarial practice, and his violation of his oath as lawyer when he prepared and notarized the second deed for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the correct amount of taxes, shall be meted with a penalty of a two (2)-year suspension from the practice of law. The said penalty is proper and commensurate to the infraction committed by respondent. (Emphases supplied; citations omitted) Pertinently, in Section 33(p), Canon VI of A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), a violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice is considered a serious offense. Once found guilty of a serious offense, a lawyer may be met with the following sanctions, as provided by Section 37(a), Canon VI of the CPRA: SECTION 37. Sanctions. – Applying all the foregoing to the instant case, the Court finds no reason to depart from the findings and recommendations of the IBP Board of Governors, imposing upon respondent the penalties of: (1) suspension from the practice of law for a period of two years; (2) immediate revocation of his notarial commission, if subsisting; and (3) disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two years. As a final note, the Court deems it imperative to remind notaries public that the act of notarization is not an empty, meaningless and routinary act. As elucidated in Gonzales v. Atty. Ramos: Notarization is not an empty, meaningless routinary act. It is invested with substantive public interest. The notarization by a notary public converts a private document into a public document, making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. A notarial document is, by law, entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. A notary public must observe with utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties; otherwise, the public’s confidence in the integrity of the document would be undermined. WHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Cesar R. Santiago, Jr. is found GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and Canon VI of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years; his notarial commission is hereby REVOKED, effective immediately; and he is hereby DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two (2) years. He is, likewise, STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely. He is DIRECTED to report the date of receipt of this Decision in order to determine when his suspension shall take effect.
