FACTS:


ISSUES:
Notably, Briones is indeed not on all fours with the case at bench. In that case, petitioner Briones directly assailed the validity of the loan agreement, promissory note, and deed of real estate mortgage, claiming forgery in their execution. The Court, thus, declared that Briones cannot be expected to comply with the aforesaid venue stipulation, as his compliance therewith would mean an implicit recognition of their validity. Certainly, a complaint directly assailing the validity of the written instrument itself should not be bound by the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein and should be filed in accordance with the general rules on venue. Plain as day, the foregoing facts differ with the instant case given that petitioner herein does not dispute the authenticity of the loan and mortgage documents but merely seeks the reformation thereof as they are purportedly contracts of adhesion and do not reflect hers and the bank’s true mutual intention. Nevertheless, while the facts in Briones and this case are dissimilar, the Court’s disquisition in the former on the matter of venue is instructive, viz.:

RULINGS:
Challenged in this Petition for Review on Certiorari are the Decision and the Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) Cagayan de Oro City Station in CA-G.R. CV No. 04749-MIN. The impugned Decision affirmed the Order of Branch 17 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, dismissing the Complaint for reformation of mortgage, nullity of foreclosure, damages, and attorney’s fees with temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction filed by Lucille Odilao (petitioner) against Union Bank of the Philippines (respondent bank) and Atty. Natasha M. Go-De Mesa, the Register of Deeds of Davao City. Upon the other hand, the assailed Resolution denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration thereof. The facts of the case are uncomplicated. Petitioner, represented by her son, Ariel Odilao, filed before the trial court the instant complaint, praying, inter alia, that it render a decision declaring that the subject loan and mortgage agreements which she and her husband, Tyrone Victor G. Odilao, executed in favor of respondent bank, are contracts of adhesion and therefore, must be reformed to reflect their true and mutual intention, viz.: Maintaining that the instant complaint should be dismissed, respondent bank asserted that the loan documents signed by the parties stated that the venue of the action should be before the courts of Pasig City. Thus, pursuant to Section 1(c), Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, the complaint is dismissible on the ground of improperly laid venue. Also, the Real Estate Mortgage, indisputably provides that any action arising out of the said mortgage shall either be in the place where the property is located or in Pasig City at the absolute option of the [respondent] Bank. While it may be true that the subject property is located in Davao City, the present action cannot still be heard and adjudicated in this Court absent the express manifestation of the mortgagee [respondent bank] of its option to have the case litigated in Davao City. Notably, the provisions as to venue of the Real Estate Mortgage holds no doubt that the venue of actions arising out of the said mortgage is at the option of [respondent bank]. In view of the foregoing, it can be concluded that based on agreement of the parties as stated in the subject instruments, this Court is not the proper venue to hear and decide the instant action. SECTION 1. Venue of real actions. — Actions affecting title to or possession of real property, or interest therein, shall be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated. Forcible entry and detainer actions shall be commenced and tried in the municipal trial court of the municipality or city wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated. SEC. 2. Venue of personal actions. — All other actions may be commenced and tried where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants resides, or in the case of a non-resident defendant where he may be found, at the election of the plaintiff. SEC. 4. When Rule not applicable. — This Rule shall not apply — Such being the case, petitioner’s complaint, which was filed before the Regional Trial Court of Davao City where the mortgaged property is located, should not have been dismissed as the same complied with the venue stipulation stated in the Real Estate Mortgage. Upon this point, the Court is perplexed as to why the CA affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of petitioner’s complaint when it itself pronounced that “the venue stipulation in the Real Estate Mortgage should be controlling.” On the other hand, the trial court, mistakenly interpreted the phrase “at the absolute option of the Mortgagee” to mean that “the present action cannot still be heard and adjudicated in this court absent the express manifestation of the mortgagee [respondent bank] of its option to have this case litigated in Davao City.” Moreover, it must be emphasized that the restrictive stipulation on venue only refers to the geographical location and should not in any way curb the right of a party to file a case. This being so, to interpret the phrase “at the absolute option of the Mortgagee” to mean that petitioner should have inquired first from respondent bank which venue it preferred, i.e., Pasig City or Davao City, before she filed the instant action, would mean that she would be left at the mercy of the bank, as she would still have to wait for its response before she could exercise her right to litigate. At most, such phrase takes significance only when it is respondent bank which would file the case. WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review of Certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated July 17, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 9, 2020 of the Court of Appeals Cagayan De Oro City Station, in CA-G.R. CV No. 04749-MIN, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Complaint for reformation of mortgage, nullity of foreclosure, damages, and attorney’s fees with temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction filed by petitioner Lucille B. Odilao, represented by Ariel B. Odilao, against respondent Union Bank of the Philippines and Atty. Natasha M. Go-De Mesa, the Register of Deeds of Davao City, before Branch 77 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City and docketed as Civil Case No. R-DVO-16-01024-CV is REINSTATED. The trial court is further ordered to proceed with the disposition of the case with dispatch.
