FACTS:
Anent the issue of res judicata the RTC remarked that there is no identity of causes of action between the petitions previously filed which ascribed psychological incapacity on Olivia part and the present case which is brought on the ground of Reghi own psychological incapacity. On November 19 2013 the Republic filed a petition for review on certiorari before this Court docketed as No. 209180 where it maintained that Reghis has not established that his alleged psychological incapacity is grave has juridical antecedence and is incurable. It averred that the psychological report prepared and submitted by Dr. Basilio has no factual basis to support the conclusions found therein as she failed to describe in detail the pattern of behavior showing that Reghis indeed suffered from OCPD. The Republic also claimed that the methodology employed in evaluating Reghi condition is not comprehensive enough and that based on Reghi own testimony he was able to perform his marital obligations as he lived together with Olivia for years and attended to his duties to their children. It pointed out that Reghi condition was not shown to have existed before their marriage and that the same is incurable. The Issue Before the CourtThe lone issue for the Court resolution is whether or not the CA erred in sustaining the RTC declaration of nullity on the ground of psychological incapacity. After a thorough review of the records of this case the Court finds that the foregoing requirements do not concur. As aptly pointed out by the petitioners Reghi testimony shows that he was able to comply with his marital obligations which therefore negates the existence of a grave and serious psychological incapacity on his part. Reghis admitted that he and Olivia lived together as husband and wife under one roof for fourteen 14 years and both of them contributed in purchasing their own house in Paranaque City. Reghis also fulfilled his duty to support and take care of his family as he categorically stated that he loves their children and that he was a good provider to them. That he married Olivia not out of love but out of reverence for the latter parents does not mean that Reghis is psychologically incapacitated in the context of Article 36 of the Family Code. In Republic Albios the Court held that: Moreover the OCPD which Reghis allegedly suffered from was not shown to have juridical antecedence. Other than Dr. Basilio conclusion that Reghi behavioral disorder x x x existed even prior to the marriage or even during his adolescent years no specific behavior or habits during his adolescent years were shown which would explain his behavior during his marriage with Olivia. Simply put Dr. Basilio medical report did not establish that Reghi incapacity existed long before he entered into marriage. In like manner Dr. Basilio simply concluded that Reghi disorder is incurable but failed to explain how she came to such conclusion. Based on the appreciation of the RTC Dr. Basilio did not discuss the concept of OCPD its classification cause symptoms and cure and failed to show how and to what extent the respondent exhibited this disorder in order to create a necessary inference that Reghi condition had no definite treatment or is incurable. To the Court mind this is a glaring deficiency that should have prompted the RTC and the CA to be more circumspect and critical in the assessment and appreciation of Dr. Basilio testimony.

ISSUES:
Before the Court are consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the Decision dated March 21 2013 and the Resolution dated September 12 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-CV No. 94337 which affirmed the Decision dated November 5 2008 of the Regional Trial Court RTC of Quezon City Branch 225 RTC Branch 225 in Civil Case No. Q-98-34627 declaring the marriage of Reghis Romero II Reghis and Olivia Lagman Romero Olivia null and void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines Family Code as amended.

RULINGS:
Reghis and Olivia were married on May 11 1972 at the Mary the Queen Parish in San Juan City and were blessed with two 2 children namely Michael and Nathaniel born in 1973 and 1975 respectively. The couple first met in Baguio City in 1971 when Reghis helped Olivia and her family who were stranded along Kennon Road. Since then Reghis developed a closeness with Olivia family especially with the latter parents who tried to play matchmakers for Reghis and Olivia. In the desire to please Olivia parents Reghis courted Olivia and eventually they became sweethearts. Reghis was still a student at the time determined to finish his studies and provide for the financial needs of his siblings and parents. Thus less than a year into their relationship Reghis tried to break-up with Olivia because he felt that her demanding attitude would prevent him from reaching his personal and family goals. Olivia however refused to end their relationship and insisted on staying with Reghis at the latter dormitory overnight. Reghis declined and instead made arrangements with his friends so that Olivia could sleep in a female dormitory. The next day Reghis brought Olivia home and while nothing happened between them the previous night Olivia parents believed that they had eloped and planned for them to get married. Reghis initially objected to the planned marriage as he was unemployed and still unprepared. However Olivia parents assured him that they would shoulder all expenses and would support them until they are financially able. As Olivia parents had treated him with nothing but kindness Reghis agreed. The couple experienced a turbulent and tumultuous marriage often having violent fights and jealous fits. Reghis could not forgive Olivia for dragging him into marriage and resented her condescending attitude towards him. They became even more estranged when Reghis secured a job as a medical representative and became engrossed in his career and focused on supporting his parents and siblings. As a result he spent little time with his family causing Olivia to complain that Reghis failed to be a real husband to her. In 1986 the couple parted ways. On June 16 1998 Reghis filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage before the RTC of Quezon City Branch 94 docketed as Civil Case No. Q-98-34627 citing his psychological incapacity to comply with his essential marital obligations. In support of his petition Reghis testified that he married Olivia not out of love but out of the desire to please the latter parents who were kind and accommodating to him. Reghis further maintained that he was not prepared to comply with the essential marital obligations at the time as his mind was geared towards finishing his studies and finding employment to support his parents and siblings. He also added that Olivia is in a relationship with a certain Eddie Garcia Mr. Garcia but he Reghis has no ill-feelings towards Mr. Garcia as he and Olivia have been separated for a long time. Reghis also presented Dr. Valentina Nicdao-Basilio Dr. Basilio a clinical psychologist who submitted a Psychological Evaluation Report dated April 28 1998 and testified that Reghis suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder OCPD . According to Dr. Basilio Reghi behavioral disorder gave him a strong obsession for whatever endeavour he chooses such as his work to the exclusion of other responsibilities and duties such as those pertaining to his roles as father and husband. Dr. Basilio surmised that Reghi OCPD was the root of the couple disagreements and that the same is incurable explaining too that Reghis was an unwilling groom as marriage was farthest from his mind at the time and as such felt cheated into marriage. For her part Olivia maintained that she and Reghis were capacitated to discharge the essential marital obligations before at the time and after the celebration of their marriage. She also averred that the petition is barred by res judicata inasmuch as Reghis had previously filed petitions for the declaration of the nullity of their marriage on the ground the she is allegedly psychologically incapacitated but said petitions were dismissed. Olivia however was unable to present evidence due to the absence of her counsel which was considered by the RTC as waiver of her right to present evidence. In a Decision dated November 5 2008 the RTC granted the petition and declared the marriage between Reghis and Olivia null and void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity. It relied on the findings and testimony of Dr. Basilio holding that Reghis suffered from a disorder that rendered him unable to perform the obligations of love respect and fidelity towards Olivia as it gave him a strong obsession to succeed in his career to the exclusion of his responsibilities as a father and husband. It also concurred with Dr. Basilio observation that Reghis is still deeply attached to his parents and siblings such that he pursues his business ventures for their benefit. Likewise it agreed that Reghi behavioral disorder existed even before his marriage or even his adolescent years and that the same is incurable. The Republic and Olivia moved for reconsideration which was however denied by the RTC in a Resolution dated July 3 2009. Undaunted both appealed to the CA. On November 13 2013 a separate petition for review on certiorari docketed as No. 209253 was filed by Olivia. Like the Republic she pointed out that Reghis himself admitted knowing his marital obligations as husband to Olivia and father to their children. Olivia added that if Reghis indeed felt that he was being forced into the marriage he could have simply abandoned her then or refused to take his vows on their wedding day. Motives for entering into a marriage are varied and complex. The State does not and cannot dictate on the kind of life that a couple chooses to lead. Any attempt to regulate their lifestyle would go into the realm of their right to privacy and would raise serious constitutional questions. The right to marital privacy allows married couples to structure their marriages in almost any way they see fit to live together or live apart to have children or no children to love one another or not and so on. Thus marriages entered into for other purposes limited or otherwise such as convenience companionship money status and title provided that they comply with all the legal requisites are equally valid. Love though the ideal consideration in a marriage contract is not the only valid cause for marriage. Other considerations not precluded by law may validly support a marriage. Emphasis supplied
