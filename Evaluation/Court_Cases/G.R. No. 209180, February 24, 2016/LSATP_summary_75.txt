FACTS:

RULINGS:
Before the Court are consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the Decision dated March 21 2013 and the Resolution dated September 12 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-CV No. 94337 which affirmed the Decision dated November 5 2008 of the Regional Trial Court RTC of Quezon City Branch 225 RTC Branch 225 in Civil Case No. Q-98-34627 declaring the marriage of Reghis Romero II Reghis and Olivia Lagman Romero Olivia null and void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines Family Code as amended. Reghis and Olivia were married on May 11 1972 at the Mary the Queen Parish in San Juan City and were blessed with two 2 children namely Michael and Nathaniel born in 1973 and 1975 respectively. The couple first met in Baguio City in 1971 when Reghis helped Olivia and her family who were stranded along Kennon Road. Since then Reghis developed a closeness with Olivia family especially with the latter parents who tried to play matchmakers for Reghis and Olivia. In the desire to please Olivia parents Reghis courted Olivia and eventually they became sweethearts. Reghis was still a student at the time determined to finish his studies and provide for the financial needs of his siblings and parents. Thus less than a year into their relationship Reghis tried to break-up with Olivia because he felt that her demanding attitude would prevent him from reaching his personal and family goals. Olivia however refused to end their relationship and insisted on staying with Reghis at the latter dormitory overnight. Reghis declined and instead made arrangements with his friends so that Olivia could sleep in a female dormitory. The next day Reghis brought Olivia home and while nothing happened between them the previous night Olivia parents believed that they had eloped and planned for them to get married. Reghis initially objected to the planned marriage as he was unemployed and still unprepared. However Olivia parents assured him that they would shoulder all expenses and would support them until they are financially able. As Olivia parents had treated him with nothing but kindness Reghis agreed. On June 16 1998 Reghis filed a petition for declaration of nullity of marriage before the RTC of Quezon City Branch 94 docketed as Civil Case No. Q-98-34627 citing his psychological incapacity to comply with his essential marital obligations. In support of his petition Reghis testified that he married Olivia not out of love but out of the desire to please the latter parents who were kind and accommodating to him. Reghis further maintained that he was not prepared to comply with the essential marital obligations at the time as his mind was geared towards finishing his studies and finding employment to support his parents and siblings. He also added that Olivia is in a relationship with a certain Eddie Garcia Mr. Garcia but he Reghis has no ill-feelings towards Mr. Garcia as he and Olivia have been separated for a long time. For her part Olivia maintained that she and Reghis were capacitated to discharge the essential marital obligations before at the time and after the celebration of their marriage. She also averred that the petition is barred by res judicata inasmuch as Reghis had previously filed petitions for the declaration of the nullity of their marriage on the ground the she is allegedly psychologically incapacitated but said petitions were dismissed. Olivia however was unable to present evidence due to the absence of her counsel which was considered by the RTC as waiver of her right to present evidence. The Office of the Solicitor General OSG representing the Republic of the Philippines Republic opposed the petition. The RTC Ruling In a Decision dated November 5 2008 the RTC granted the petition and declared the marriage between Reghis and Olivia null and void ab initio on the ground of psychological incapacity. It relied on the findings and testimony of Dr. Basilio holding that Reghis suffered from a disorder that rendered him unable to perform the obligations of love respect and fidelity towards Olivia as it gave him a strong obsession to succeed in his career to the exclusion of his responsibilities as a father and husband. It also concurred with Dr. Basilio observation that Reghis is still deeply attached to his parents and siblings such that he pursues his business ventures for their benefit. Likewise it agreed that Reghi behavioral disorder existed even before his marriage or even his adolescent years and that the same is incurable. Anent the issue of res judicata the RTC remarked that there is no identity of causes of action between the petitions previously filed which ascribed psychological incapacity on Olivia part and the present case which is brought on the ground of Reghi own psychological incapacity. The Republic and Olivia moved for reconsideration which was however denied by the RTC in a Resolution dated July 3 2009. Undaunted both appealed to the CA. The CA Ruling In a Decision dated March 21 2013 the CA affirmed the findings of the RTC holding that the OCPD from which Reghis suffered made him yearn for professional advancement and rendered him obligated to support his parents and siblings at the expense of his marital and filial duties. It ruled that Reghi condition amounts to psychological incapacity within the contemplation of Article 36 of the Family Code as it is permanent in nature and incurable. It observed that Reghi OCPD started early in his psychological development and is now so deeply ingrained in his structure and thus incurable because people who suffer from it are of the belief that nothing is wrong with them. It further concluded that Reghi condition is severe considering that it interrupted and interfered with his normal functioning and rendered him unable to assume the essential marital obligations. The Republic and Olivia respective motions for reconsideration32 were denied by the CA in a Resolution dated September 12 2013. The Proceedings Before the Court On November 13 2013 a separate petition for review on certiorari docketed as No. 209253 was filed by Olivia. Like the Republic she pointed out that Reghis himself admitted knowing his marital obligations as husband to Olivia and father to their children. Olivia added that if Reghis indeed felt that he was being forced into the marriage he could have simply abandoned her then or refused to take his vows on their wedding day. In a Resolution dated February 17 2014 the Court consolidated the present petitions.
