RULINGS:
Fianza was charged with two 2 counts of violation of Section 5 b Article III of RA 7610 under two 2 Informations dated April 6 2011 filed before the RTC. The prosecution version of the incidents are as follows: Sometime in July 2010 AAA who was then 11 years old was called by Fianza to his house and thereupon was asked to wash his clothes. After AAA was finished with the laundry Fianza asked her to go with him to the kamalig. Thereat they proceeded to the second floor where Fianza removed his pants and briefs lied down and ordered AAA to hold his penis and masturbate him. After ejaculating Fianza put on his clothes and gave P20.00 to AAA who thereafter went home. On November 30 2010 while AAA was home Fianza called her to his house and asked her to clean the same. After she was done sweeping the floor they proceeded to the second floor of the kamalig. Thereat Fianza again removed his pants and briefs lied down and ordered AAA to fondle his penis. After the deed he gave P20.00 to AAA who thereafter went home. After the second incident AAA related the matter to her cousin CCC who in turn told BBB AAA mother who reported the matter to the police. For his part Fianza interposed the defense of denial and alibi. He claimed that he lived with his uncle in Andalasi Pangasinan Andalasi while the rest of his family resided in Sapinit Pangasinan Sapinit and were neighbors with AAA. He averred that in July 2010 he went to Sapinit to gamble all night and went to his parent house the following morning to sleep before going home to Andalasi. As for the November 30 2010 incident he maintained that he was in Andalasi drinking with his friends as he had just sold a carabao. The next day he went to get the carabao that he sold and bought more liquor. He proceeded to Sapinit to have another drinking session that lasted until December 4 2010. In a Decision dated September 6 2012 the RTC found Fianza guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two 2 counts of violation of Section 5 b Article III of RA 7610 and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of twelve 12 years and one 1 day of reclusion temporal minimum as minimum to fourteen 14 years eight 8 months and one 1 day of reclusion temporal medium as maximum and ordered him to pay AAA the amount of P30 000.00 as moral damages for each count. Aggrieved Fianza elevated his conviction to the CA docketed as CA-CR No. 35293. In a Decision dated November 24 2014 the CA upheld Fianza conviction for two 2 counts of violation of Section 5 b Article III of RA 7610. In the present case the existence of all the elements of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC as well as the first and third elements of sexual abuse under Section 5 b Article III of RA 7610 remains undisputed. Records disclose that on two 2 occasions in July 2010 and on November 30 2010 Fianza induced AAA an 11-year-old minor to hold his penis and masturbate him. The only point of dispute is with regard to the existence of the second element of sexual abuse whether or not the lascivious conduct was performed on a child subjected to other sexual abuse. Records likewise indicate that Fianza was about 35 years old at the time of the commission of the offense or 24 years older than AAA more or less. The age disparity between them clearly placed Fianza in a stronger position over AAA which enabled him to wield his will on the latter.
