FACTS:

The prosecution presented PO2 Nestor Lehetemas member of the buy-bust team and PO2 James Nolan Ibañez the poseur-buyer.

The informant pointed to the two accused Luis Pajarin and Efren Pallaya. They stood 10 to 20 steps away beside a red scooter. PO2 Ibañez and the informant approached them. After the informant introduced PO2 Ibañez as an interested buyer the police officer bought shabu from the two using the marked P500.00 bill. Pajarin opened the compartment of the red scooter and took from it one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance. When Pallaya asked for the money PO2 Ibañez handed it to him. Then Pajarin gave one plastic sachet containing the suspected shabu to the officer who raised his right hand as a pre-arranged signal. PO2 Ibañez companions immediately rushed to the group. PO2 Ibañez grabbed Pallaya. Pajarin tried to escape but PO2 Lehetemas got hold of him. The police searched the red scooter compartment and recovered another plastic sachet containing the same substance. They then brought the accused to their station. The arresting officers turned over the seized suspected shabu to PO3 Roel Young who marked the plastic sachet seized from the scooter with the letters ETP and the sachet Pajarin handed over with the letters LDCP.

As he left the house and got into the street someone hit his helmet grabbed him and dragged him into a Tamaraw FX. They then brought him back to Pallaya house where four police officers got in and brought Pallaya out with them after about three minutes. The officers brought the two accused to the police station where they were investigated. PO2 Ibañez showed Pajarin a plastic sachet which he supposedly recovered from Pajarin scooter. Pajarin denied owning the sachet. It was a police officer who drove the scooter to the police station. For his part Pallaya testified that on June 2 2005 he was taking a bath at the fourth floor of his four-storey house when he heard knocking at the door.

The officers ordered him to dress up and forced him to go with them. Pallaya asked for a warrant of arrest or a search warrant but he got no response from them. They made him board a Tamaraw FX where Pajarin sat. They then brought the accused to the police station. On March 31 2008 the RTC found both accused guilty of the crime charged and imposed on them the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500 000.00 in Criminal Case 05-237756.
